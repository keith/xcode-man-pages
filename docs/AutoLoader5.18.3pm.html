<p class="Pp">The <b>AutoLoader</b> module works with the <b>AutoSplit</b>
    module and the <span class="Li">&quot;__END__&quot;</span> token to defer
    the loading of some subroutines until they are used rather than loading them
    all at once.</p>
<p class="Pp">To use <b>AutoLoader</b>, the author of a module has to place the
    definitions of subroutines to be autoloaded after an
    <span class="Li">&quot;__END__&quot;</span> token. (See perldata.) The
    <b>AutoSplit</b> module can then be run manually to extract the definitions
    into individual files <i>auto/funcname.al</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>AutoLoader</b> implements an AUTOLOAD subroutine. When an
    undefined subroutine in is called in a client module of <b>AutoLoader</b>,
    <b>AutoLoader</b>'s AUTOLOAD subroutine attempts to locate the subroutine in
    a file with a name related to the location of the file from which the client
    module was read. As an example, if <i>POSIX.pm</i> is located in
    <i>/usr/local/lib/perl5/POSIX.pm</i>, <b>AutoLoader</b> will look for perl
    subroutines <b>POSIX</b> in <i>/usr/local/lib/perl5/auto/POSIX/*.al</i>,
    where the <span class="Li">&quot;.al&quot;</span> file has the same name as
    the subroutine, sans package. If such a file exists, AUTOLOAD will read and
    evaluate it, thus (presumably) defining the needed subroutine. AUTOLOAD will
    then <span class="Li">&quot;goto&quot;</span> the newly defined
  subroutine.</p>
<p class="Pp">Once this process completes for a given function, it is defined,
    so future calls to the subroutine will bypass the AUTOLOAD mechanism.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Subroutine_Stubs"><a class="permalink" href="#Subroutine_Stubs">Subroutine
  Stubs</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">In order for object method lookup and/or prototype checking to
    operate correctly even when methods have not yet been defined it is
    necessary to &quot;forward declare&quot; each subroutine (as in
    <span class="Li">&quot;sub NAME;&quot;</span>). See &quot;SYNOPSIS&quot; in
    perlsub. Such forward declaration creates &quot;subroutine stubs&quot;,
    which are place holders with no code.</p>
<p class="Pp">The AutoSplit and <b>AutoLoader</b> modules automate the creation
    of forward declarations. The AutoSplit module creates an 'index' file
    containing forward declarations of all the AutoSplit subroutines. When the
    AutoLoader module is 'use'd it loads these declarations into its callers
    package.</p>
<p class="Pp">Because of this mechanism it is important that <b>AutoLoader</b>
    is always <span class="Li">&quot;use&quot;</span>d and not
    <span class="Li">&quot;require&quot;</span>d.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Using_"><a class="permalink" href="#Using_">Using
  <b>AutoLoader</b>'s AUTOLOAD Subroutine</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">In order to use <b>AutoLoader</b>'s AUTOLOAD subroutine you
    <i>must</i> explicitly import it:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    use AutoLoader 'AUTOLOAD';

<h2 class="Ss" id="Overriding_"><a class="permalink" href="#Overriding_">Overriding
  <b>AutoLoader</b>'s AUTOLOAD Subroutine</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Some modules, mainly extensions, provide their own AUTOLOAD
    subroutines. They typically need to check for some special cases (such as
    constants) and then fallback to <b>AutoLoader</b>'s AUTOLOAD for the
  rest.</p>
<p class="Pp">Such modules should <i>not</i> import <b>AutoLoader</b>'s AUTOLOAD
    subroutine. Instead, they should define their own AUTOLOAD subroutines along
    these lines:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    use AutoLoader;
    use Carp;
    sub AUTOLOAD {
        my $sub = $AUTOLOAD;
        (my $constname = $sub) =~ s/.*:://;
        my $val = constant($constname, @_ ? $_[0] : 0);
        if ($! != 0) {
            if ($! =~ /Invalid/ || $!{EINVAL}) {
                $AutoLoader::AUTOLOAD = $sub;
                goto &amp;AutoLoader::AUTOLOAD;
            }
            else {
                croak &quot;Your vendor has not defined constant $constname&quot;;
            }
        }
        *$sub = sub { $val }; # same as: eval &quot;sub $sub { $val }&quot;;
        goto &amp;$sub;
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If any module's own AUTOLOAD subroutine has no need to fallback to
    the AutoLoader's AUTOLOAD subroutine (because it doesn't have any AutoSplit
    subroutines), then that module should not use <b>AutoLoader</b> at all.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Package_Lexicals"><a class="permalink" href="#Package_Lexicals">Package
  Lexicals</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Package lexicals declared with
    <span class="Li">&quot;my&quot;</span> in the main block of a package using
    <b>AutoLoader</b> will not be visible to auto-loaded subroutines, due to the
    fact that the given scope ends at the
    <span class="Li">&quot;__END__&quot;</span> marker. A module using such
    variables as package globals will not work properly under the
    <b>AutoLoader</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;vars&quot;</span> pragma (see
    &quot;vars&quot; in perlmod) may be used in such situations as an
    alternative to explicitly qualifying all globals with the package namespace.
    Variables pre-declared with this pragma will be visible to any autoloaded
    routines (but will not be invisible outside the package, unfortunately).</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss"><b>AutoLoader</b> vs. <b>SelfLoader</b></h2>
<p class="Pp">The <b>AutoLoader</b> is similar in purpose to <b>SelfLoader</b>:
    both delay the loading of subroutines.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>SelfLoader</b> uses the
    <span class="Li">&quot;__DATA__&quot;</span> marker rather than
    <span class="Li">&quot;__END__&quot;</span>. While this avoids the use of a
    hierarchy of disk files and the associated open/close for each routine
    loaded, <b>SelfLoader</b> suffers a startup speed disadvantage in the
    one-time parsing of the lines after
    <span class="Li">&quot;__DATA__&quot;</span>, after which routines are
    cached. <b>SelfLoader</b> can also handle multiple packages in a file.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>AutoLoader</b> only reads code as it is requested, and in many
    cases should be faster, but requires a mechanism like <b>AutoSplit</b> be
    used to create the individual files. ExtUtils::MakeMaker will invoke
    <b>AutoSplit</b> automatically if <b>AutoLoader</b> is used in a module
    source file.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Forcing_AutoLoader_to_Load_a_Function"><a class="permalink" href="#Forcing_AutoLoader_to_Load_a_Function">Forcing
  AutoLoader to Load a Function</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Sometimes, it can be necessary or useful to make sure that a
    certain function is fully loaded by AutoLoader. This is the case, for
    example, when you need to wrap a function to inject debugging code. It is
    also helpful to force early loading of code before forking to make use of
    copy-on-write as much as possible.</p>
<p class="Pp">Starting with AutoLoader 5.73, you can call the
    <span class="Li">&quot;AutoLoader::autoload_sub&quot;</span> function with
    the fully-qualified name of the function to load from its <i>.al</i> file.
    The behaviour is exactly the same as if you called the function, triggering
    the regular <span class="Li">&quot;AUTOLOAD&quot;</span> mechanism, but it
    does not actually execute the autoloaded function.</p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="CAVEATS"><a class="permalink" href="#CAVEATS">CAVEATS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">AutoLoaders prior to Perl 5.002 had a slightly different
    interface. Any old modules which use <b>AutoLoader</b> should be changed to
    the new calling style. Typically this just means changing a require to a
    use, adding the explicit <span class="Li">'AUTOLOAD'</span> import if
    needed, and removing <b>AutoLoader</b> from
  <span class="Li">@ISA</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">On systems with restrictions on file name length, the file
    corresponding to a subroutine may have a shorter name that the routine
    itself. This can lead to conflicting file names. The <i>AutoSplit</i>
    package warns of these potential conflicts when used to split a module.</p>
<p class="Pp">AutoLoader may fail to find the autosplit files (or even find the
    wrong ones) in cases where <span class="Li">@INC</span> contains relative
    paths, <b>and</b> the program does
    <span class="Li">&quot;chdir&quot;</span>.</p>

    For those of you that choose to use the GNU General Public License,

    said script under the terms of the GPL yourself.  Furthermore, any
    object code linked with perl does not automatically fall under the
    terms of the GPL, provided such object code only adds definitions
    of subroutines and variables, and does not otherwise impair the
    resulting interpreter from executing any standard Perl script.  I
    consider linking in C subroutines in this manner to be the moral
    equivalent of defining subroutines in the Perl language itself.  You
    may sell such an object file as proprietary provided that you provide
    or offer to provide the Perl source, as specified by the GNU General
    Public License.  (This is merely an alternate way of specifying input
    to the program.)  You may also sell a binary produced by the dumping of
    a running Perl script that belongs to you, provided that you provide or
    offer to provide the Perl source as specified by the GPL.  (The
    fact that a Perl interpreter and your code are in the same binary file
    is, in this case, a form of mere aggregation.)  This is my interpretation
    of the GPL.  If you still have concerns or difficulties understanding
    my intent, feel free to contact me.  Of course, the Artistic License
    spells all this out for your protection, so you may prefer to use that.
