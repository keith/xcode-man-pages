<p class="Pp">This module provides functions that are the inverse of built-in
    perl functions <span class="Li">&quot;localtime()&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;gmtime()&quot;</span>. They accept a date as a
    six-element array, and return the corresponding
    <span class="Li">time(2)</span> value in seconds since the system epoch
    (Midnight, January 1, 1970 GMT on Unix, for example). This value can be
    positive or negative, though POSIX only requires support for positive
    values, so dates before the system's epoch may not work on all operating
    systems.</p>
<p class="Pp">It is worth drawing particular attention to the expected ranges
    for the values provided. The value for the day of the month is the actual
    day (i.e. 1..31), while the month is the number of months since January
    (0..11). This is consistent with the values returned from
    <span class="Li">&quot;localtime()&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;gmtime()&quot;</span>.</p>

  and &quot;timegm_modern()&quot;</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">When <span class="Li">&quot;Time::Local&quot;</span> was first
    written, it was a common practice to represent years as a two-digit value
    like <span class="Li">99</span> for <span class="Li">1999</span> or
    <span class="Li">1</span> for <span class="Li">2001</span>. This caused all
    sorts of problems (google &quot;Y2K problem&quot; if you're very young) and
    developers eventually realized that this was a terrible idea.</p>
<p class="Pp">The default exports of
    <span class="Li">&quot;timelocal()&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;timegm()&quot;</span> do a complicated calculation
    when given a year value less than 1000. This leads to surprising results in
    many cases. See &quot;Year Value Interpretation&quot; for details.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;time*_modern()&quot;</span> subs do not
    do this year munging and simply take the year value as provided.</p>
<p class="Pp">While it would be nice to make this the default behavior, that
    would almost certainly break a lot of code, so you must explicitly import
    these subs and use them instead of the default
    <span class="Li">&quot;timelocal()&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;timegm()&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">You are <b>strongly</b> encouraged to use these subs in any new
    code which uses this module. It will almost certainly make your code's
    behavior less surprising.</p>

<p class="Pp">This module exports two functions by default,

<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;timelocal()&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;timegm()&quot;</span> functions perform range
    checking on the input <span class="Li">$sec</span>,
    <span class="Li">$min</span>, <span class="Li">$hour</span>,

  and &quot;timegm_nocheck()&quot;</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">If you are working with data you know to be valid, you can speed
    your code up by using the &quot;nocheck&quot; variants,
    <span class="Li">&quot;timelocal_nocheck()&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;timegm_nocheck()&quot;</span>. These variants must be
    explicitly imported.</p>

<pre>    use Time::Local 'timelocal_nocheck';
    # The 365th day of 1999
    print scalar localtime timelocal_nocheck( 0, 0, 0, 365, 0, 99 );

<p class="Pp"><b>This does not apply to

    </b><span class="Li"><b>&quot;timegm_modern&quot;</b></span><b>. Use

    ages.</b></p>
<p class="Pp">Strictly speaking, the year should be specified in a form
    consistent with <span class="Li">&quot;localtime()&quot;</span>, i.e. the
    offset from 1900. In order to make the interpretation of the year easier for
    humans, however, who are more accustomed to seeing years as two-digit or
    four-digit values, the following conventions are followed:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Years greater than 999 are interpreted as being the actual year, rather
      than the offset from 1900. Thus, 1964 would indicate the year Martin
      Luther King won the Nobel prize, not the year 3864.</li>
  <li>Years in the range 100..999 are interpreted as offset from 1900, so that
      112 indicates 2012. This rule also applies to years less than zero (but
      see note below regarding date range).</li>
  <li>Years in the range 0..99 are interpreted as shorthand for years in the
      rolling &quot;current century,&quot; defined as 50 years on either side of
      the current year. Thus, today, in 1999, 0 would refer to 2000, and 45 to
      2045, but 55 would refer to 1955. Twenty years from now, 55 would instead
      refer to 2055. This is messy, but matches the way people currently think
      about two digit dates. Whenever possible, use an absolute four digit year
      instead.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">The scheme above allows interpretation of a wide range of dates,
    particularly if 4-digit years are used.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Limits_of_time_t"><a class="permalink" href="#Limits_of_time_t">Limits
  of time_t</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">On perl versions older than 5.12.0, the range of dates that can be
    actually be handled depends on the size of
    <span class="Li">&quot;time_t&quot;</span> (usually a signed integer) on the
    given platform. Currently, this is 32 bits for most systems, yielding an
    approximate range from Dec 1901 to Jan 2038.</p>
<p class="Pp">Both <span class="Li">&quot;timelocal()&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;timegm()&quot;</span> croak if given dates outside
    the supported range.</p>
<p class="Pp">As of version 5.12.0, perl has stopped using the time
    implementation of the operating system it's running on. Instead, it has its
    own implementation of those routines with a safe range of at least +/- 2**52
    (about 142 million years)</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Ambiguous_Local_Times_("><a class="permalink" href="#Ambiguous_Local_Times_(">Ambiguous
  Local Times (DST)</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Because of DST changes, there are many time zones where the same
    local time occurs for two different GMT times on the same day. For example,
    in the &quot;Europe/Paris&quot; time zone, the local time of 2001-10-28
    02:30:00 can represent either 2001-10-28 00:30:00 GMT, <b>or</b> 2001-10-28
    01:30:00 GMT.</p>
<p class="Pp">When given an ambiguous local time, the <b>timelocal()</b>
    function should always return the epoch for the <i>earlier</i> of the two
    possible GMT times.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Non-Existent_Local_Times_("><a class="permalink" href="#Non-Existent_Local_Times_(">Non-Existent
  Local Times (DST)</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">When a DST change causes a locale clock to skip one hour forward,
    there will be an hour's worth of local times that don't exist. Again, for
    the &quot;Europe/Paris&quot; time zone, the local clock jumped from
    2001-03-25 01:59:59 to 2001-03-25 03:00:00.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the <span class="Li">&quot;timelocal()&quot;</span> function is
    given a non-existent local time, it will simply return an epoch value for
    the time one hour later.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Negative_Epoch_Values"><a class="permalink" href="#Negative_Epoch_Values">Negative
  Epoch Values</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">On perl version 5.12.0 and newer, negative epoch values are fully
    supported.</p>
<p class="Pp">On older versions of perl, negative epoch
    (<span class="Li">&quot;time_t&quot;</span>) values, which are not
    officially supported by the POSIX standards, are known not to work on some
    systems. These include MacOS (pre-OSX) and Win32.</p>
<p class="Pp">On systems which do support negative epoch values, this module
    should be able to cope with dates before the start of the epoch, down the
    minimum value of time_t for the system.</p>
</section>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="IMPLEMENTATION"><a class="permalink" href="#IMPLEMENTATION">IMPLEMENTATION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">These routines are quite efficient and yet are always guaranteed
    to agree with <span class="Li">&quot;localtime()&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;gmtime()&quot;</span>. We manage this by caching the
    start times of any months we've seen before. If we know the start time of
    the month, we can always calculate any time within the month. The start
    times are calculated using a mathematical formula. Unlike other algorithms
    that do multiple calls to <span class="Li">&quot;gmtime()&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;timelocal()&quot;</span> function is
    implemented using the same cache. We just assume that we're translating a
    GMT time, and then fudge it when we're done for the timezone and daylight
    savings arguments. Note that the timezone is evaluated for each date because
    countries occasionally change their official timezones. Assuming that
    <span class="Li">&quot;localtime()&quot;</span> corrects for these changes,
    this routine will also be correct.</p>
