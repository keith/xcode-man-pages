Reads list of objects from the standard input, and writes either one or more
  packed archives with the specified base-name to disk, or a packed archive to
  the standard output.
<p class="Pp">A packed archive is an efficient way to transfer a set of objects
    between two repositories as well as an access efficient archival format. In
    a packed archive, an object is either stored as a compressed whole or as a
    difference from some other object. The latter is often called a delta.</p>
<p class="Pp">The packed archive format (.pack) is designed to be self-contained
    so that it can be unpacked without any further information. Therefore, each
    object that a delta depends upon must be present within the pack.</p>
<p class="Pp">A pack index file (.idx) is generated for fast, random access to
    the objects in the pack. Placing both the index file (.idx) and the packed
    archive (.pack) in the pack/ subdirectory of $GIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY (or any
    of the directories on $GIT_ALTERNATE_OBJECT_DIRECTORIES) enables Git to read
    from the pack archive.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>git unpack-objects</i> command can read the packed archive
    and expand the objects contained in the pack into &quot;one-file
    one-object&quot; format; this is typically done by the smart-pull commands
    when a pack is created on-the-fly for efficient network transport by their
    peers.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
base-name
<div class="Bd-indent">Write into pairs of files (.pack and .idx), using
  &lt;base-name&gt; to determine the name of the created file. When this option
  is used, the two files in a pair are written in
  &lt;base-name&gt;-&lt;SHA-1&gt;.{pack,idx} files. &lt;SHA-1&gt; is a hash
  based on the pack content and is written to the standard output of the
  command.</div>
<p class="Pp">--stdout</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Write the pack contents (what would have been written to
  .pack file) out to the standard output.</div>
<p class="Pp">--revs</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Read the revision arguments from the standard input,
  instead of individual object names. The revision arguments are processed the
  same way as <i>git rev-list</i> with the <b>--objects</b> flag uses its
  <b>commit</b> arguments to build the list of objects it outputs. The objects
  on the resulting list are packed. Besides revisions, <b>--not</b> or
  <b>--shallow &lt;SHA-1&gt;</b> lines are also accepted.</div>
<p class="Pp">--unpacked</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This implies <b>--revs</b>. When processing the list of
  revision arguments read from the standard input, limit the objects packed to
  those that are not already packed.</div>
<p class="Pp">--all</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This implies <b>--revs</b>. In addition to the list of
  revision arguments read from the standard input, pretend as if all refs under
  <b>refs/</b> are specified to be included.</div>
<p class="Pp">--include-tag</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Include unasked-for annotated tags if the object they
  reference was included in the resulting packfile. This can be useful to send
  new tags to native Git clients.</div>
<p class="Pp">--window=&lt;n&gt;, --depth=&lt;n&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">These two options affect how the objects contained in the
  pack are stored using delta compression. The objects are first internally
  sorted by type, size and optionally names and compared against the other
  objects within --window to see if using delta compression saves space. --depth
  limits the maximum delta depth; making it too deep affects the performance on
  the unpacker side, because delta data needs to be applied that many times to
  get to the necessary object.
<p class="Pp">The default value for --window is 10 and --depth is 50. The
    maximum depth is 4095.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--window-memory=&lt;n&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This option provides an additional limit on top of
  <b>--window</b>; the window size will dynamically scale down so as to not take
  up more than <i>&lt;n&gt;</i> bytes in memory. This is useful in repositories
  with a mix of large and small objects to not run out of memory with a large
  window, but still be able to take advantage of the large window for the
  smaller objects. The size can be suffixed with &quot;k&quot;, &quot;m&quot;,
  or &quot;g&quot;. <b>--window-memory=0</b> makes memory usage unlimited. The
  default is taken from the <b>pack.windowMemory</b> configuration
  variable.</div>
<p class="Pp">--max-pack-size=&lt;n&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">In unusual scenarios, you may not be able to create files
  larger than a certain size on your filesystem, and this option can be used to
  tell the command to split the output packfile into multiple independent
  packfiles, each not larger than the given size. The size can be suffixed with
  &quot;k&quot;, &quot;m&quot;, or &quot;g&quot;. The minimum size allowed is
  limited to 1 MiB. This option prevents the creation of a bitmap index. The
  default is unlimited, unless the config variable <b>pack.packSizeLimit</b> is
  set.</div>
<p class="Pp">--honor-pack-keep</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This flag causes an object already in a local pack that
  has a .keep file to be ignored, even if it would have otherwise been
  packed.</div>
<p class="Pp">--keep-pack=&lt;pack-name&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This flag causes an object already in the given pack to
  be ignored, even if it would have otherwise been packed.
  <b>&lt;pack-name&gt;</b> is the pack file name without leading directory (e.g.
  <b>pack-123.pack</b>). The option could be specified multiple times to keep
  multiple packs.</div>
<p class="Pp">--incremental</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This flag causes an object already in a pack to be
  ignored even if it would have otherwise been packed.</div>
<p class="Pp">--local</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This flag causes an object that is borrowed from an
  alternate object store to be ignored even if it would have otherwise been
  packed.</div>
<p class="Pp">--non-empty</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Only create a packed archive if it would contain at least
  one object.</div>
<p class="Pp">--progress</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Progress status is reported on the standard error stream
  by default when it is attached to a terminal, unless -q is specified. This
  flag forces progress status even if the standard error stream is not directed
  to a terminal.</div>
<p class="Pp">--all-progress</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When --stdout is specified then progress report is
  displayed during the object count and compression phases but inhibited during
  the write-out phase. The reason is that in some cases the output stream is
  directly linked to another command which may wish to display progress status
  of its own as it processes incoming pack data. This flag is like --progress
  except that it forces progress report for the write-out phase as well even if
  --stdout is used.</div>
<p class="Pp">--all-progress-implied</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This is used to imply --all-progress whenever progress
  display is activated. Unlike --all-progress this flag doesn&#x2019;t actually
  force any progress display by itself.</div>
<p class="Pp">-q</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This flag makes the command not to report its progress on
  the standard error stream.</div>
<p class="Pp">--no-reuse-delta</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When creating a packed archive in a repository that has
  existing packs, the command reuses existing deltas. This sometimes results in
  a slightly suboptimal pack. This flag tells the command not to reuse existing
  deltas but compute them from scratch.</div>
<p class="Pp">--no-reuse-object</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This flag tells the command not to reuse existing object
  data at all, including non deltified object, forcing recompression of
  everything. This implies --no-reuse-delta. Useful only in the obscure case
  where wholesale enforcement of a different compression level on the packed
  data is desired.</div>
<p class="Pp">--compression=&lt;n&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Specifies compression level for newly-compressed data in
  the generated pack. If not specified, pack compression level is determined
  first by pack.compression, then by core.compression, and defaults to -1, the
  zlib default, if neither is set. Add --no-reuse-object if you want to force a
  uniform compression level on all data no matter the source.</div>
<p class="Pp">--sparse</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Use the &quot;sparse&quot; algorithm to determine which
  objects to include in the pack, when combined with the &quot;--revs&quot;
  option. This algorithm only walks trees that appear in paths that introduce
  new objects. This can have significant performance benefits when computing a
  pack to send a small change. However, it is possible that extra objects are
  added to the pack-file if the included commits contain certain types of direct
  renames.</div>
<p class="Pp">--thin</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Create a &quot;thin&quot; pack by omitting the common
  objects between a sender and a receiver in order to reduce network transfer.
  This option only makes sense in conjunction with --stdout.
<p class="Pp">Note: A thin pack violates the packed archive format by omitting
    required objects and is thus unusable by Git without making it
    self-contained. Use <b>git index-pack --fix-thin</b> (see
    <b>git-index-pack</b>(1)) to restore the self-contained property.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--shallow</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Optimize a pack that will be provided to a client with a
  shallow repository. This option, combined with --thin, can result in a smaller
  pack at the cost of speed.</div>
<p class="Pp">--delta-base-offset</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A packed archive can express the base object of a delta
  as either a 20-byte object name or as an offset in the stream, but ancient
  versions of Git don&#x2019;t understand the latter. By default, <i>git
  pack-objects</i> only uses the former format for better compatibility. This
  option allows the command to use the latter format for compactness. Depending
  on the average delta chain length, this option typically shrinks the resulting
  packfile by 3-5 per-cent.
<p class="Pp">Note: Porcelain commands such as <b>git gc</b> (see
    <b>git-gc</b>(1)), <b>git repack</b> (see <b>git-repack</b>(1)) pass this
    option by default in modern Git when they put objects in your repository
    into pack files. So does <b>git bundle</b> (see <b>git-bundle</b>(1)) when
    it creates a bundle.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--threads=&lt;n&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Specifies the number of threads to spawn when searching
  for best delta matches. This requires that pack-objects be compiled with
  pthreads otherwise this option is ignored with a warning. This is meant to
  reduce packing time on multiprocessor machines. The required amount of memory
  for the delta search window is however multiplied by the number of threads.
  Specifying 0 will cause Git to auto-detect the number of CPU&#x2019;s and set
  the number of threads accordingly.</div>
<p class="Pp">--index-version=&lt;version&gt;[,&lt;offset&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This is intended to be used by the test suite only. It
  allows to force the version for the generated pack index, and to force 64-bit
  index entries on objects located above the given offset.</div>
<p class="Pp">--keep-true-parents</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">With this option, parents that are hidden by grafts are
  packed nevertheless.</div>
<p class="Pp">--filter=&lt;filter-spec&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Requires <b>--stdout</b>. Omits certain objects (usually
  blobs) from the resulting packfile. See <b>git-rev-list</b>(1) for valid
  <b>&lt;filter-spec&gt;</b> forms.</div>
<p class="Pp">--no-filter</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Turns off any previous <b>--filter=</b> argument.</div>
<p class="Pp">--missing=&lt;missing-action&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A debug option to help with future &quot;partial
  clone&quot; development. This option specifies how missing objects are
  handled.
<p class="Pp">The form <i>--missing=error</i> requests that pack-objects stop
    with an error if a missing object is encountered. This is the default
    action.</p>
<p class="Pp">The form <i>--missing=allow-any</i> will allow object traversal to
    continue if a missing object is encountered. Missing objects will silently
    be omitted from the results.</p>
<p class="Pp">The form <i>--missing=allow-promisor</i> is like <i>allow-any</i>,
    but will only allow object traversal to continue for EXPECTED promisor
    missing objects. Unexpected missing object will raise an error.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--exclude-promisor-objects</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Omit objects that are known to be in the promisor remote.
  (This option has the purpose of operating only on locally created objects, so
  that when we repack, we still maintain a distinction between locally created
  objects [without .promisor] and objects from the promisor remote [with
  .promisor].) This is used with partial clone.</div>
<p class="Pp">--keep-unreachable</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Objects unreachable from the refs in packs named with
  --unpacked= option are added to the resulting pack, in addition to the
  reachable objects that are not in packs marked with *.keep files. This implies
  <b>--revs</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--pack-loose-unreachable</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Pack unreachable loose objects (and their loose
  counterparts removed). This implies <b>--revs</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--unpack-unreachable</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Keep unreachable objects in loose form. This implies
  <b>--revs</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--delta-islands</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Restrict delta matches based on &quot;islands&quot;. See
  DELTA ISLANDS below.</div>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DELTA_ISLANDS"><a class="permalink" href="#DELTA_ISLANDS">DELTA
  ISLANDS</a></h1>
When possible, <b>pack-objects</b> tries to reuse existing on-disk deltas to
  avoid having to search for new ones on the fly. This is an important
  optimization for serving fetches, because it means the server can avoid
  inflating most objects at all and just send the bytes directly from disk. This
  optimization can&#x2019;t work when an object is stored as a delta against a
  base which the receiver does not have (and which we are not already sending).
  In that case the server &quot;breaks&quot; the delta and has to find a new
  one, which has a high CPU cost. Therefore it&#x2019;s important for
  performance that the set of objects in on-disk delta relationships match what
  a client would fetch.
<p class="Pp">In a normal repository, this tends to work automatically. The
    objects are mostly reachable from the branches and tags, and that&#x2019;s
    what clients fetch. Any deltas we find on the server are likely to be
    between objects the client has or will have.</p>
<p class="Pp">But in some repository setups, you may have several related but
    separate groups of ref tips, with clients tending to fetch those groups
    independently. For example, imagine that you are hosting several
    &quot;forks&quot; of a repository in a single shared object store, and
    letting clients view them as separate repositories through
    <b>GIT_NAMESPACE</b> or separate repos using the alternates mechanism. A
    naive repack may find that the optimal delta for an object is against a base
    that is only found in another fork. But when a client fetches, they will not
    have the base object, and we&#x2019;ll have to find a new delta on the
  fly.</p>
<p class="Pp">A similar situation may exist if you have many refs outside of
    <b>refs/heads/</b> and <b>refs/tags/</b> that point to related objects
    (e.g., <b>refs/pull</b> or <b>refs/changes</b> used by some hosting
    providers). By default, clients fetch only heads and tags, and deltas
    against objects found only in those other groups cannot be sent as-is.</p>
<p class="Pp">Delta islands solve this problem by allowing you to group your
    refs into distinct &quot;islands&quot;. Pack-objects computes which objects
    are reachable from which islands, and refuses to make a delta from an object
    <b>A</b> against a base which is not present in all of <b>A</b>'s islands.
    This results in slightly larger packs (because we miss some delta
    opportunities), but guarantees that a fetch of one island will not have to
    recompute deltas on the fly due to crossing island boundaries.</p>
<p class="Pp">When repacking with delta islands the delta window tends to get
    clogged with candidates that are forbidden by the config. Repacking with a
    big --window helps (and doesn&#x2019;t take as long as it otherwise might
    because we can reject some object pairs based on islands before doing any
    computation on the content).</p>
<p class="Pp">Islands are configured via the <b>pack.island</b> option, which
    can be specified multiple times. Each value is a left-anchored regular
    expressions matching refnames. For example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
[pack]
island = refs/heads/
island = refs/tags/
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">puts heads and tags into an island (whose name is the empty
    string; see below for more on naming). Any refs which do not match those
    regular expressions (e.g., <b>refs/pull/123</b>) is not in any island. Any
    object which is reachable only from <b>refs/pull/</b> (but not heads or
    tags) is therefore not a candidate to be used as a base for
    <b>refs/heads/</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Refs are grouped into islands based on their &quot;names&quot;,
    and two regexes that produce the same name are considered to be in the same
    island. The names are computed from the regexes by concatenating any capture
    groups from the regex, with a <i>-</i> dash in between. (And if there are no
    capture groups, then the name is the empty string, as in the above example.)
    This allows you to create arbitrary numbers of islands. Only up to 14 such
    capture groups are supported though.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, imagine you store the refs for each fork in
    <b>refs/virtual/ID</b>, where <b>ID</b> is a numeric identifier. You might
    then configure:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
[pack]
island = refs/virtual/([0-9]+)/heads/
island = refs/virtual/([0-9]+)/tags/
island = refs/virtual/([0-9]+)/(pull)/
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">That puts the heads and tags for each fork in their own island
    (named &quot;1234&quot; or similar), and the pull refs for each go into
    their own &quot;1234-pull&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that we pick a single island for each regex to go into, using
    &quot;last one wins&quot; ordering (which allows repo-specific config to
    take precedence over user-wide config, and so forth).</p>
