A special file mode, called the <i class="Em">sticky bit</i> (mode S_ISVTX), is
  used to indicate special treatment for directories. It is ignored for regular
  files. See <a class="Xr">chmod(2)</a> or the file
  <code class="In">&lt;<a class="In">sys/stat.h</a>&gt;</code> for an
  explanation of file modes.

  DIRECTORIES</a></h1>
A directory whose `sticky bit' is set becomes an append-only directory, or, more
  accurately, a directory in which the deletion of files is restricted. A file
  in a sticky directory may only be removed or renamed by a user if the user has
  write permission for the directory and the user is the owner of the file, the
  owner of the directory, or the super-user. This feature is usefully applied to
  directories such as <span class="Pa">/tmp</span> which must be publicly
  writable but should deny users the license to arbitrarily delete or rename
  each others' files.
<p class="Pp">Any user may create a sticky directory. See
    <a class="Xr">chmod(1)</a> for details about modifying file modes.</p>
