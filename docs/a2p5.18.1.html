   Set up some character translations and predefined strings.  \*(-- will
   give an unbreakable dash, \*(PI will give pi, \*(L" will give a left
   double quote, and \*(R" will give a right double quote.  \*(C+ will
   give a nicer C++.  Capital omega is used to do unbreakable dashes and
   therefore won't be available.  \*(C` and \*(C' expand to `' in nroff,
   nothing in troff, for use with C<>.

<i>A2p</i> takes an awk script specified on the command line (or from standard
  input) and produces a comparable <i>perl</i> script on the standard output.

A2p cannot do as good a job translating as a human would, but it usually does
  pretty well. There are some areas where you may want to examine the perl
  script produced and tweak it some. Here are some of them, in no particular
  order.
<p class="Pp">There is an awk idiom of putting <i>int()</i> around a string
    expression to force numeric interpretation, even though the argument is
    always integer anyway. This is generally unneeded in perl, but a2p can't
    tell if the argument is always going to be integer, so it leaves it in. You
    may wish to remove it.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl differentiates numeric comparison from string comparison. Awk
    has one operator for both that decides at run time which comparison to do.
    A2p does not try to do a complete job of awk emulation at this point.
    Instead it guesses which one you want. It's almost always right, but it can
    be spoofed. All such guesses are marked with the comment
    &quot;<span class="Li">&quot;#???&quot;</span>&quot;. You should go through
    and check them. You might want to run at least once with the <b>-w</b>
    switch to perl, which will warn you if you use == where you should have used
    eq.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl does not attempt to emulate the behavior of awk in which
    nonexistent array elements spring into existence simply by being referenced.
    If somehow you are relying on this mechanism to create null entries for a
    subsequent for...in, they won't be there in perl.</p>
<p class="Pp">If a2p makes a split line that assigns to a list of variables that
    looks like (Fld1, Fld2, Fld3...) you may want to rerun a2p using the
    <b>-n</b> option mentioned above. This will let you name the fields
    throughout the script. If it splits to an array instead, the script is
    probably referring to the number of fields somewhere.</p>
<p class="Pp">The exit statement in awk doesn't necessarily exit; it goes to the
    END block if there is one. Awk scripts that do contortions within the END
    block to bypass the block under such circumstances can be simplified by
    removing the conditional in the END block and just exiting directly from the
    perl script.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl has two kinds of array, numerically-indexed and associative.
    Perl associative arrays are called &quot;hashes&quot;. Awk arrays are
    usually translated to hashes, but if you happen to know that the index is
    always going to be numeric you could change the {...} to [...]. Iteration
    over a hash is done using the <i>keys()</i> function, but iteration over an
    array is NOT. You might need to modify any loop that iterates over such an
    array.</p>
<p class="Pp">Awk starts by assuming OFMT has the value %.6g. Perl starts by
    assuming its equivalent, $#, to have the value %.20g. You'll want to set $#
    explicitly if you use the default value of OFMT.</p>
<p class="Pp">Near the top of the line loop will be the split operation that is
    implicit in the awk script. There are times when you can move this down past
    some conditionals that test the entire record so that the split is not done
    as often.</p>
<p class="Pp">For aesthetic reasons you may wish to change index variables from
    being 1-based (awk style) to 0-based (Perl style). Be sure to change all
    operations the variable is involved in to match.</p>
<p class="Pp">Cute comments that say &quot;# Here is a workaround because awk is
    dumb&quot; are passed through unmodified.</p>
<p class="Pp">Awk scripts are often embedded in a shell script that pipes stuff
    into and out of awk. Often the shell script wrapper can be incorporated into
    the perl script, since perl can start up pipes into and out of itself, and
    can do other things that awk can't do by itself.</p>
<p class="Pp">Scripts that refer to the special variables RSTART and RLENGTH can
    often be simplified by referring to the variables $`, $&amp; and $', as long
    as they are within the scope of the pattern match that sets them.</p>
<p class="Pp">The produced perl script may have subroutines defined to deal with
    awk's semantics regarding getline and print. Since a2p usually picks
    correctness over efficiency. it is almost always possible to rewrite such
    code to be more efficient by discarding the semantic sugar.</p>
<p class="Pp">For efficiency, you may wish to remove the keyword from any return
    statement that is the last statement executed in a subroutine. A2p catches
    the most common case, but doesn't analyze embedded blocks for subtler
  cases.</p>
<p class="Pp">ARGV[0] translates to <span class="Li">$ARGV0</span>, but ARGV[n]
    translates to <span class="Li">$ARGV</span>[$n-1]. A loop that tries to
    iterate over ARGV[0] won't find it.</p>

It would be possible to emulate awk's behavior in selecting string versus
  numeric operations at run time by inspection of the operands, but it would be
  gross and inefficient. Besides, a2p almost always guesses right.
<p class="Pp">Storage for the awk syntax tree is currently static, and can run
    out.</p>
