<p class="Pp">The Carp routines are useful in your own modules because they act
    like <span class="Li">&quot;die()&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;warn()&quot;</span>, but with a message which is more
    likely to be useful to a user of your module. In the case of
    <span class="Li">&quot;cluck()&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;confess()&quot;</span>, that context is a summary of
    every call in the call-stack; <span class="Li">&quot;longmess()&quot;</span>
    returns the contents of the error message.</p>
<p class="Pp">For a shorter message you can use
    <span class="Li">&quot;carp()&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;croak()&quot;</span> which report the error as being
    from where your module was called.
    <span class="Li">&quot;shortmess()&quot;</span> returns the contents of this
    error message. There is no guarantee that that is where the error was, but
    it is a good educated guess.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;Carp&quot;</span> takes care not to clobber
    the status variables <span class="Li">$!</span> and
    <span class="Li">$^E</span> in the course of assembling its error messages.
    This means that a <span class="Li">$SIG{__DIE__}</span> or
    <span class="Li">$SIG{__WARN__}</span> handler can capture the error
    information held in those variables, if it is required to augment the error
    message, and if the code calling <span class="Li">&quot;Carp&quot;</span>
    left useful values there. Of course,
    <span class="Li">&quot;Carp&quot;</span> can't guarantee the latter.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can also alter the way the output and logic of
    <span class="Li">&quot;Carp&quot;</span> works, by changing some global
    variables in the <span class="Li">&quot;Carp&quot;</span> namespace. See the
    section on <span class="Li">&quot;GLOBAL VARIABLES&quot;</span> below.</p>
<p class="Pp">Here is a more complete description of how
    <span class="Li">&quot;carp&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;croak&quot;</span> work. What they do is search the
    call-stack for a function call stack where they have not been told that
    there shouldn't be an error. If every call is marked safe, they give up and
    give a full stack backtrace instead. In other words they presume that the
    first likely looking potential suspect is guilty. Their rules for telling
    whether a call shouldn't generate errors work as follows:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>1.</dt>
  <dd>Any call from a package to itself is safe.</dd>
  <dt>2.</dt>
  <dd>Packages claim that there won't be errors on calls to or from packages
      explicitly marked as safe by inclusion in
      <span class="Li">@CARP_NOT</span>, or (if that array is empty)
      <span class="Li">@ISA</span>. The ability to override what
      <span class="Li">@ISA</span> says is new in 5.8.</dd>
  <dt>3.</dt>
  <dd>The trust in item 2 is transitive. If A trusts B, and B trusts C, then A
      trusts C. So if you do not override <span class="Li">@ISA</span> with
      <span class="Li">@CARP_NOT</span>, then this trust relationship is
      identical to, &quot;inherits from&quot;.</dd>
  <dt>4.</dt>
  <dd>Any call from an internal Perl module is safe. (Nothing keeps user modules
      from marking themselves as internal to Perl, but this practice is
      discouraged.)</dd>
  <dt>5.</dt>
  <dd>Any call to Perl's warning system (eg Carp itself) is safe. (This rule is
      what keeps it from reporting the error at the point where you call
      <span class="Li">&quot;carp&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;croak&quot;</span>.)</dd>
  <dt>6.</dt>
  <dd><span class="Li">$Carp::CarpLevel</span> can be set to skip a fixed number
      of additional call levels. Using this is not recommended because it is
      very difficult to get it to behave correctly.</dd>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Forcing_a_Stack_Trace"><a class="permalink" href="#Forcing_a_Stack_Trace">Forcing
  a Stack Trace</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">As a debugging aid, you can force Carp to treat a croak as a
    confess and a carp as a cluck across <i>all</i> modules. In other words,
    force a detailed stack trace to be given. This can be very helpful when
    trying to understand why, or from where, a warning or error is being
    generated.</p>
<p class="Pp">This feature is enabled by 'importing' the non-existent symbol
    'verbose'. You would typically enable it by saying</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    perl -MCarp=verbose script.pl
</pre>
<p class="Pp">or by including the string
    <span class="Li">&quot;-MCarp=verbose&quot;</span> in the PERL5OPT
    environment variable.</p>
<p class="Pp">Alternately, you can set the global variable
    <span class="Li">$Carp::Verbose</span> to true. See the
    <span class="Li">&quot;GLOBAL VARIABLES&quot;</span> section below.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Stack_Trace_formatting"><a class="permalink" href="#Stack_Trace_formatting">Stack
  Trace formatting</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">At each stack level, the subroutine's name is displayed along with
    its parameters. For simple scalars, this is sufficient. For complex data
    types, such as objects and other references, this can simply display
    <span class="Li">'HASH(0x1ab36d8)'</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Carp gives two ways to control this.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>1.</dt>
  <dd>For objects, a method, <span class="Li">&quot;CARP_TRACE&quot;</span>,
      will be called, if it exists. If this method doesn't exist, or it recurses
      into <span class="Li">&quot;Carp&quot;</span>, or it otherwise throws an
      exception, this is skipped, and Carp moves on to the next option,
      otherwise checking stops and the string returned is used. It is
      recommended that the object's type is part of the string to make debugging
      easier.</dd>
  <dt>2.</dt>
  <dd>For any type of reference, <span class="Li">$Carp::RefArgFormatter</span>
      is checked (see below). This variable is expected to be a code reference,
      and the current parameter is passed in. If this function doesn't exist
      (the variable is undef), or it recurses into
      <span class="Li">&quot;Carp&quot;</span>, or it otherwise throws an
      exception, this is skipped, and Carp moves on to the next option,
      otherwise checking stops and the string returned is used.</dd>
  <dt>3.</dt>
  <dd>Otherwise, if neither <span class="Li">&quot;CARP_TRACE&quot;</span> nor
      <span class="Li">$Carp::RefArgFormatter</span> is available, stringify the
      value ignoring any overloading.</dd>

<p class="Pp">This says what packages are internal to Perl.
    <span class="Li">&quot;Carp&quot;</span> will never report an error as being
    from a line in a package that is internal to Perl. For example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    $Carp::Internal{ (__PACKAGE__) }++;
    # time passes...
    sub foo { ... or confess(&quot;whatever&quot;) };
</pre>
<p class="Pp">would give a full stack backtrace starting from the first caller
    outside of __PACKAGE__. (Unless that package was also internal to Perl.)</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="_Carp::CarpInternal"><a class="permalink" href="#_Carp::CarpInternal">%Carp::CarpInternal</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">This says which packages are internal to Perl's warning system.
    For generating a full stack backtrace this is the same as being internal to
    Perl, the stack backtrace will not start inside packages that are listed in
    <span class="Li">%Carp::CarpInternal</span>. But it is slightly different
    for the summary message generated by
    <span class="Li">&quot;carp&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;croak&quot;</span>. There errors will not be reported
    on any lines that are calling packages in
    <span class="Li">%Carp::CarpInternal</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example <span class="Li">&quot;Carp&quot;</span> itself is
    listed in <span class="Li">%Carp::CarpInternal</span>. Therefore the full
    stack backtrace from <span class="Li">&quot;confess&quot;</span> will not
    start inside of <span class="Li">&quot;Carp&quot;</span>, and the short
    message from calling <span class="Li">&quot;croak&quot;</span> is not placed
    on the line where <span class="Li">&quot;croak&quot;</span> was called.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="$Carp::CarpLevel"><a class="permalink" href="#$Carp::CarpLevel">$Carp::CarpLevel</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">This variable determines how many additional call frames are to be
    skipped that would not otherwise be when reporting where an error occurred
    on a call to one of <span class="Li">&quot;Carp&quot;</span>'s functions. It
    is fairly easy to count these call frames on calls that generate a full
    stack backtrace. However it is much harder to do this accounting for calls
    that generate a short message. Usually people skip too many call frames. If
    they are lucky they skip enough that
    <span class="Li">&quot;Carp&quot;</span> goes all of the way through the
    call stack, realizes that something is wrong, and then generates a full
    stack backtrace. If they are unlucky then the error is reported from
    somewhere misleading very high in the call stack.</p>
<p class="Pp">Therefore it is best to avoid
    <span class="Li">$Carp::CarpLevel</span>. Instead use
    <span class="Li">@CARP_NOT</span>, <span class="Li">%Carp::Internal</span>
