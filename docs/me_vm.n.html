   The definitions below are for supplemental macros used in Tcl/Tk
   manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget.  The
  	options follow on successive lines, in four columns separated
  	by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.

grammar::me_vm - Virtual machine for parsing token streams
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
Please go and read the document <b>grammar::me_intro</b> first for an overview
  of the various documents and their relations.
<p class="Pp">This document specifies a virtual machine for the controlled
    matching and parsing of token streams, creating an <i>abstract syntax
    tree</i> (short <i>AST</i>) reflecting the structure of the input. Special
    machine features are the caching and reuse of partial results, caching of
    the encountered input, and the ability to backtrack in both input and AST
    creation.</p>
<p class="Pp">These features make the specified virtual machine especially
    useful to packrat parsers based on parsing expression grammars. It is
    however not restricted to this type of parser. Normal LL and LR parsers can
    be implemented with it as well.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following sections will discuss first the abstract state kept
    by ME virtual machines, and then their instruction set.</p>
</section>

A ME virtual machine manages the following state:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><i>Current token</i> CT</dt>
  <dd>The token from the input under consideration by the machine.
    <p class="Pp">This information is used and modified by the instructions
        defined in the section <b>TERMINAL MATCHING</b>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><i>Current location</i> CL</dt>
  <dd>The location of the <i>current token</i> in the input stream, as offset
      relative to the beginning of the stream. The first token is considered to
      be at offset <b>0</b>.
    <p class="Pp">This information is implicitly used and modified by the
        instructions defined in the sections <b>TERMINAL MATCHING</b> and
        <b>NONTERMINAL MATCHING</b>, and can be directly queried and modified by
        the instructions defined in section <b>INPUT LOCATION HANDLING</b>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><i>Location stack</i> LS</dt>
  <dd>In addition to the above a stack of locations, for backtracking. Locations
      can put on the stack, removed from it, and removed with setting the
      current location.
    <p class="Pp">This information is implicitly used and modified by the
        instructions defined in the sections <b>TERMINAL MATCHING</b> and
        <b>NONTERMINAL MATCHING</b>, and can be directly queried and modified by
        the instructions defined in section <b>INPUT LOCATION HANDLING</b>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><i>Match status</i> OK</dt>
  <dd>A boolean value, the result of the last attempt at matching input. It is
      set to <b>true</b> if that attempt was successful, and <b>false</b>
      otherwise.
    <p class="Pp">This information is influenced by the instructions defined in

        in the section <b>CONTROL FLOW</b>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><i>Semantic value</i> SV</dt>
  <dd>The semantic value associated with (generated by) the last attempt at
      matching input. Contains either the empty string or a node for the
      abstract syntax tree constructed from the input.
    <p class="Pp">This information is influenced by the instructions defined in
        the sections <b>SEMANTIC VALUES</b>, and <b>AST STACK HANDLING</b>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><i>AST stack</i> AS</dt>

  </dd>
  <dt><i>AST Marker stack</i> MS</dt>
  <dd>In addition to the above a stack of stacks, for backtracking. This is
      actually a stack of markers into the AST stack, thus implicitly
      snapshooting the state of the AST stack at some point in time. Markers can
      be put on the stack, dropped from it, and used to roll back the AST stack
      to an earlier state.

  </dd>
  <dt><i>Error status</i> ER</dt>
  <dd>Error information associated with the last attempt at matching input.
      Contains either the empty string or a list of 2 elements, a location in
      the input and a list of error messages associated with it, in this order.
    <p class="Pp"><i>Note</i> that error information can be set even if the last
        attempt at matching input was successful. For example the *-operator
        (matching a sub-expression zero or more times) in a parsing expression
        grammar is always successful, even if it encounters a problem further in
        the input and has to backtrack. Such problems must not be forgotten when
        continuing to match.</p>

First the instructions to match tokens from the input stream, and by extension
  all terminal symbols.
<p class="Pp">These instructions are the only ones which may retrieve a new
    token from the input stream. This is a <i>may</i> and not a <i>will</i>
    because the instructions will a retrieve new token if, and only if the
    current location <i>CL</i> is at the head of the stream. If the machine has

    to compare against from the internal cache.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>ict_advance</b> <i>message</i></dt>
  <dd>This instruction tries to advance to the next token in the input stream,

<h2 class="Ss" id="NONTERMINAL_MATCHING"><a class="permalink" href="#NONTERMINAL_MATCHING">NONTERMINAL
  MATCHING</a></h2>
The instructions in this section handle the matching of nonterminal symbols.
  They query the nonterminal cache <i>NC</i> for saved information, and put such
  information into the cache.
<p class="Pp">The usage of the cache is a performance aid for backtracking
    parsers, allowing them to avoid an expensive rematch of complex nonterminal
    symbols if they have been encountered before.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>inc_restore</b> <i>branchlabel</i> <i>nt</i></dt>
  <dd>This instruction checks if the nonterminal cache <i>NC</i> contains
      information about the nonterminal symbol <i>nt</i>, at the current
      location <i>CL</i>. If that is the case the instruction will update the
      machine state (current location <i>CL</i>, match status <i>OK</i>,
      semantic value <i>SV</i>, and error status <i>ER</i>) with the found
      information and continue execution at the instruction refered to by the
      <i>branchlabel</i>. The new current location <i>CL</i> will be the last
      token matched by the nonterminal symbol, i.e. belonging to it.
    <p class="Pp">If no information was found the instruction will continue
        execution at the next instruction.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Together with <b>icf_ntcall</b> it is possible to generate
        code for memoized and non-memoized matching of nonterminal symbols,
        either as subroutine calls, or inlined in the caller.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>inc_save</b> <i>nt</i></dt>
  <dd>This instruction saves the current state of the machine (current location
      <i>CL</i>, match status <i>OK</i>, semantic value <i>SV</i>, and error
      status <i>ER</i>), to the nonterminal cache <i>NC</i>. It will also pop an
      entry from the location stack <i>LS</i> and save it as the start location
      of the match.
    <p class="Pp">It is expected to be called at the end of matching a
        nonterminal symbol, with <i>nt</i> the name of the nonterminal symbol
        the code was working on. This allows the instruction <b>inc_restore</b>
        to check for and retrieve the data, should we have to match this
        nonterminal symbol at the same location again, during backtracking.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>icf_ntcall</b> <i>branchlabel</i></dt>
  <dd>This instruction invokes the code for matching the nonterminal symbol
      <i>nt</i> as a subroutine. To this end it stores the current program
      counter <i>PC</i> on the return stack <i>RS</i>, the current location
      <i>CL</i> on the location stack <i>LS</i>, and then continues execution at
      the address <i>branchlabel</i>.
    <p class="Pp">The next matching <b>icf_ntreturn</b> will cause the execution
        to continue at the instruction coming after the call.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>icf_ntreturn</b></dt>

  <dt><b>isv_nonterminal_range</b> <i>nt</i></dt>
  <dd>This instruction creates a nonterminal AST node for the nonterminal
      <i>nt</i>, with a single terminal node as its child, and makes this AST
      the semantic value <i>SV</i>. The terminal node refers to the input string
      from the location found on top of the location stack <i>LS</i> to the
      current location <i>CL</i> (both inclusive).
    <p class="Pp">This instruction should be executed if, and only if the match
        status <i>OK</i> indicates a success. In the case of a failure
        <b>isv_clear</b> should be called.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>isv_nonterminal_reduce</b> <i>nt</i></dt>
  <dd>This instruction creates a nonterminal AST node for the nonterminal
      <i>nt</i> and makes it the semantic value <i>SV</i>.
    <p class="Pp">All entries on the AST stack <i>AS</i> above the marker found
        in the top entry of the AST Marker stack <i>MS</i> become children of
        the new node, with the entry at the stack top becoming the rightmost
        child. If the AST Marker stack <i>MS</i> is empty the whole stack is
        used. The AST marker stack <i>MS</i> is left unchanged.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This instruction should be executed if, and only if the match
        status <i>OK</i> indicates a success. In the case of a failure
        <b>isv_clear</b> should be called.</p>

  <dt><b>ias_mrewind</b></dt>
  <dd>This instruction pops an entry from the AST Marker stack <i>MS</i> and
      then proceeds to pop entries from the AST stack <i>AS</i> until the state
      represented by the popped marker has been reached again. Nothing is done
      if the AST stack <i>AS</i> is already smaller than indicated by the popped
      marker.</dd>
  <dt><b>ias_mpop</b></dt>
  <dd>This instruction pops an entry from the AST Marker stack <i>MS</i> and
