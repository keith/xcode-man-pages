The <i>chat</i> program defines a conversational exchange between the computer
  and the modem. Its primary purpose is to establish the connection between the
  Point-to-Point Protocol Daemon (<i>pppd</i>) and the remote's <i>pppd</i>
  process.
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>-f <i>&lt;chat file&gt;</i></b></dt>
  <dd>Read the chat script from the chat <i>file</i>. The use of this option is
      mutually exclusive with the chat script parameters. The user must have
      read access to the file. Multiple lines are permitted in the file. Space
      or horizontal tab characters should be used to separate the strings.</dd>
  <dt><b>-t <i>&lt;timeout&gt;</i></b></dt>
  <dd>Set the timeout for the expected string to be received. If the string is
      not received within the time limit then the reply string is not sent. An
      alternate reply may be sent or the script will fail if there is no
      alternate reply string. A failed script will cause the <i>chat</i> program
      to terminate with a non-zero error code.</dd>
  <dt><b>-r <i>&lt;report file&gt;</i></b></dt>
  <dd>Set the file for output of the report strings. If you use the keyword
      <i>REPORT</i>, the resulting strings are written to this file. If this
      option is not used and you still use <i>REPORT</i> keywords, the
      <i>stderr</i> file is used for the report strings.</dd>
  <dt><b>-e</b></dt>
  <dd>Start with the echo option turned on. Echoing may also be turned on or off
      at specific points in the chat script by using the <i>ECHO</i> keyword.
      When echoing is enabled, all output from the modem is echoed to
      <i>stderr</i>.</dd>
  <dt><b>-E</b></dt>
  <dd>Enables environment variable substituion within chat scripts using the
      standard <i>$xxx</i> syntax.</dd>
  <dt><b>-v</b></dt>
  <dd>Request that the <i>chat</i> script be executed in a verbose mode. The
      <i>chat</i> program will then log the execution state of the chat script
      as well as all text received from the modem and the output strings sent to
      the modem. The default is to log through the SYSLOG; the logging method
      may be altered with the -S and -s flags.</dd>
  <dt><b>-V</b></dt>
  <dd>Request that the <i>chat</i> script be executed in a stderr verbose mode.
      The <i>chat</i> program will then log all text received from the modem and
      the output strings sent to the modem to the stderr device. This device is
      usually the local console at the station running the chat or pppd
    program.</dd>
  <dt><b>-s</b></dt>
  <dd>Use stderr. All log messages from '-v' and all error messages will be sent
      to stderr.</dd>
  <dt><b>-S</b></dt>
  <dd>Do not use the SYSLOG. By default, error messages are sent to the SYSLOG.
      The use of -S will prevent both log messages from '-v' and error messages
      from being sent to the SYSLOG.</dd>
  <dt><b>-T <i>&lt;phone number&gt;</i></b></dt>
  <dd>Pass in an arbitary string, usually a phone number, that will be
      substituted for the \T substitution metacharacter in a send string.</dd>
  <dt><b>-U <i>&lt;phone number 2&gt;</i></b></dt>
  <dd>Pass in a second string, usually a phone number, that will be substituted
      for the \U substitution metacharacter in a send string. This is useful
      when dialing an ISDN terminal adapter that requires two numbers.</dd>
  <dt><b>script</b></dt>
  <dd>If the script is not specified in a file with the <i>-f</i> option then
      the script is included as parameters to the <i>chat</i> program.</dd>

<h1 class="Sh" id="CHAT_SCRIPT"><a class="permalink" href="#CHAT_SCRIPT">CHAT
  SCRIPT</a></h1>
The <i>chat</i> script defines the communications.
<p class="Pp">A script consists of one or more &quot;expect-send&quot; pairs of
    strings, separated by spaces, with an optional &quot;subexpect-subsend&quot;
    string pair, separated by a dash as in the following example:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>ogin:-BREAK-ogin: ppp ssword: hello2u2</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">This line indicates that the <i>chat</i> program should expect the
    string &quot;ogin:&quot;. If it fails to receive a login prompt within the
    time interval allotted, it is to send a break sequence to the remote and
    then expect the string &quot;ogin:&quot;. If the first &quot;ogin:&quot; is
    received then the break sequence is not generated.</p>
<p class="Pp">Once it received the login prompt the <i>chat</i> program will
    send the string ppp and then expect the prompt &quot;ssword:&quot;. When it
    receives the prompt for the password, it will send the password
  hello2u2.</p>
<p class="Pp">A carriage return is normally sent following the reply string. It
    is not expected in the &quot;expect&quot; string unless it is specifically
    requested by using the \r character sequence.</p>
<p class="Pp">The expect sequence should contain only what is needed to identify
    the string. Since it is normally stored on a disk file, it should not
    contain variable information. It is generally not acceptable to look for
    time strings, network identification strings, or other variable pieces of
    data as an expect string.</p>
<p class="Pp">To help correct for characters which may be corrupted during the
    initial sequence, look for the string &quot;ogin:&quot; rather than
    &quot;login:&quot;. It is possible that the leading &quot;l&quot; character
    may be received in error and you may never find the string even though it
    was sent by the system. For this reason, scripts look for &quot;ogin:&quot;
    rather than &quot;login:&quot; and &quot;ssword:&quot; rather than
    &quot;password:&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">A very simple script might look like this:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>ogin: ppp ssword: hello2u2</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">In other words, expect ....ogin:, send ppp, expect ...ssword:,
    send hello2u2.</p>
<p class="Pp">In actual practice, simple scripts are rare. At the vary least,
    you should include sub-expect sequences should the original string not be
    received. For example, consider the following script:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>ogin:--ogin: ppp ssword: hello2u2</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">This would be a better script than the simple one used earlier.
    This would look for the same login: prompt, however, if one was not
    received, a single return sequence is sent and then it will look for login:
    again. Should line noise obscure the first login prompt then sending the
    empty line will usually generate a login prompt again.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="COMMENTS"><a class="permalink" href="#COMMENTS">COMMENTS</a></h1>
Comments can be embedded in the chat script. A comment is a line which starts
  with the <b>#</b> (hash) character in column 1. Such comment lines are just
  ignored by the chat program. If a '#' character is to be expected as the first
  character of the expect sequence, you should quote the expect string. If you
  want to wait for a prompt that starts with a # (hash) character, you would
  have to write something like this:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd># Now wait for the prompt and send logout string
    <br/>
    &#x00B4;# ' logout</dd>
</dl>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="SENDING_DATA_FROM_A_FILE"><a class="permalink" href="#SENDING_DATA_FROM_A_FILE">SENDING
  DATA FROM A FILE</a></h1>
If the string to send starts with an at sign (@), the rest of the string is
  taken to be the name of a file to read to get the string to send. If the last
  character of the data read is a newline, it is removed. The file can be a
  named pipe (or fifo) instead of a regular file. This provides a way for
  <b>chat</b> to communicate with another program, for example, a program to
  prompt the user and receive a password typed in.
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="ABORT_STRINGS"><a class="permalink" href="#ABORT_STRINGS">ABORT
  STRINGS</a></h1>
Many modems will report the status of the call as a string. These strings may be
  <b>CONNECTED</b> or <b>NO CARRIER</b> or <b>BUSY</b>. It is often desirable to
  terminate the script should the modem fail to connect to the remote. The
  difficulty is that a script would not know exactly which modem string it may
  receive. On one attempt, it may receive <b>BUSY</b> while the next time it may
  receive <b>NO CARRIER</b>.
<p class="Pp">These &quot;abort&quot; strings may be specified in the script
    using the <i>ABORT</i> sequence. It is written in the script as in the
    following example:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>ABORT BUSY ABORT 'NO CARRIER' '' ATZ OK ATDT5551212 CONNECT</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">This sequence will expect nothing; and then send the string ATZ.
    The expected response to this is the string <i>OK</i>. When it receives
    <i>OK</i>, the string ATDT5551212 to dial the telephone. The expected string
    is <i>CONNECT</i>. If the string <i>CONNECT</i> is received the remainder of
    the script is executed. However, should the modem find a busy telephone, it
    will send the string <i>BUSY</i>. This will cause the string to match the
    abort character sequence. The script will then fail because it found a match
    to the abort string. If it received the string <i>NO CARRIER</i>, it will
    abort for the same reason. Either string may be received. Either string will
    terminate the <i>chat</i> script.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="CLR_ABORT_STRINGS"><a class="permalink" href="#CLR_ABORT_STRINGS">CLR_ABORT
  STRINGS</a></h1>
This sequence allows for clearing previously set <b>ABORT</b> strings.
  <b>ABORT</b> strings are kept in an array of a pre-determined size (at
  compilation time); <b>CLR_ABORT</b> will reclaim the space for cleared entries
  so that new strings can use that space.
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="SAY_STRINGS"><a class="permalink" href="#SAY_STRINGS">SAY
  STRINGS</a></h1>
The <b>SAY</b> directive allows the script to send strings to the user at the
  terminal via standard error. If <b>chat</b> is being run by pppd, and pppd is
  running as a daemon (detached from its controlling terminal), standard error
  will normally be redirected to the file /etc/ppp/connect-errors.
<p class="Pp"><b>SAY</b> strings must be enclosed in single or double quotes. If
    carriage return and line feed are needed in the string to be output, you
    must explicitely add them to your string.</p>
<p class="Pp">The SAY strings could be used to give progress messages in
    sections of the script where you want to have 'ECHO OFF' but still let the
    user know what is happening. An example is:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>ABORT BUSY
    <br/>
    ECHO OFF
    <br/>
    SAY &quot;Dialling your ISP...\n&quot;
    <br/>
    &#x00B4;' ATDT5551212
    <br/>
    TIMEOUT 120
    <br/>
    SAY &quot;Waiting up to 2 minutes for connection ... &quot;
    <br/>
    CONNECT ''
    <br/>
    SAY &quot;Connected, now logging in ...0
    <br/>
    ogin: account
    <br/>
    ssword: pass
    <br/>
    $ SAY &quot;Logged in OK ...0 <i>etc ...</i></dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">This sequence will only present the SAY strings to the user and
    all the details of the script will remain hidden. For example, if the above
    script works, the user will see:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Dialling your ISP...
    <br/>
    Waiting up to 2 minutes for connection ... Connected, now logging in ...
    <br/>
    Logged in OK ...</dd>
</dl>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="REPORT_STRINGS"><a class="permalink" href="#REPORT_STRINGS">REPORT
  STRINGS</a></h1>
A <b>report</b> string is similar to the ABORT string. The difference is that
  the strings, and all characters to the next control character such as a
  carriage return, are written to the report file.
<p class="Pp">The report strings may be used to isolate the transmission rate of
    the modem's connect string and return the value to the chat user. The
    analysis of the report string logic occurs in conjunction with the other
    string processing such as looking for the expect string. The use of the same
    string for a report and abort sequence is probably not very useful, however,
    it is possible.</p>
<p class="Pp">The report strings to no change the completion code of the
    program.</p>
<p class="Pp">These &quot;report&quot; strings may be specified in the script
    using the <i>REPORT</i> sequence. It is written in the script as in the
    following example:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>REPORT CONNECT ABORT BUSY '' ATDT5551212 CONNECT '' ogin: account</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">This sequence will expect nothing; and then send the string
    ATDT5551212 to dial the telephone. The expected string is <i>CONNECT</i>. If
    the string <i>CONNECT</i> is received the remainder of the script is
    executed. In addition the program will write to the expect-file the string
    &quot;CONNECT&quot; plus any characters which follow it such as the
    connection rate.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="CLR_REPORT_STRINGS"><a class="permalink" href="#CLR_REPORT_STRINGS">CLR_REPORT
  STRINGS</a></h1>
This sequence allows for clearing previously set <b>REPORT</b> strings.
  <b>REPORT</b> strings are kept in an array of a pre-determined size (at
  compilation time); <b>CLR_REPORT</b> will reclaim the space for cleared
  entries so that new strings can use that space.
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="ECHO"><a class="permalink" href="#ECHO">ECHO</a></h1>
The echo options controls whether the output from the modem is echoed to
  <i>stderr</i>. This option may be set with the <i>-e</i> option, but it can
  also be controlled by the <i>ECHO</i> keyword. The &quot;expect-send&quot;
  pair <i>ECHO</i> <i>ON</i> enables echoing, and <i>ECHO</i> <i>OFF</i>
  disables it. With this keyword you can select which parts of the conversation
  should be visible. For instance, with the following script:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>ABORT 'BUSY'
    <br/>
    ABORT 'NO CARRIER'
    <br/>
    OK\r\n ATD1234567
    <br/>
    \r\n \c
    <br/>
    ECHO ON
    <br/>
    CONNECT \c
    <br/>
    ogin: account</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">all output resulting from modem configuration and dialing is not
    visible, but starting with the <i>CONNECT</i> (or <i>BUSY</i>) message,
    everything will be echoed.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="HANGUP"><a class="permalink" href="#HANGUP">HANGUP</a></h1>
The HANGUP options control whether a modem hangup should be considered as an
  error or not. This option is useful in scripts for dialling systems which will
  hang up and call your system back. The HANGUP options can be <b>ON</b> or
  <b>OFF</b>.
<br/>
When HANGUP is set OFF and the modem hangs up (e.g., after the first stage of
  logging in to a callback system), <b>chat</b> will continue running the script
  (e.g., waiting for the incoming call and second stage login prompt). As soon
  as the incoming call is connected, you should use the <b>HANGUP ON</b>
  directive to reinstall normal hang up signal behavior. Here is an (simple)
  example script:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>ABORT 'BUSY'
    <br/>
    OK\r\n ATD1234567
    <br/>
    \r\n \c
    <br/>
    CONNECT \c
    <br/>
    &#x00B4;Callback login:' call_back_ID
    <br/>
    HANGUP OFF
    <br/>
    ABORT &quot;Bad Login&quot;
    <br/>
    &#x00B4;Callback Password:' Call_back_password
    <br/>
    TIMEOUT 120
    <br/>
    CONNECT \c
    <br/>
    HANGUP ON
    <br/>
    ABORT &quot;NO CARRIER&quot;
    <br/>
    ogin:--BREAK--ogin: real_account
    <br/>
    <i>etc ...</i></dd>
</dl>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="TIMEOUT"><a class="permalink" href="#TIMEOUT">TIMEOUT</a></h1>
The initial timeout value is 45 seconds. This may be changed using the <b>-t</b>
  parameter.
<p class="Pp">To change the timeout value for the next expect string, the
    following example may be used:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>ATZ OK ATDT5551212 CONNECT TIMEOUT 10 ogin:--ogin: TIMEOUT 5 assword:
      hello2u2</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">This will change the timeout to 10 seconds when it expects the
    login: prompt. The timeout is then changed to 5 seconds when it looks for
    the password prompt.</p>
<p class="Pp">The timeout, once changed, remains in effect until it is changed
    again.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="SENDING_EOT"><a class="permalink" href="#SENDING_EOT">SENDING
  EOT</a></h1>
The special reply string of <i>EOT</i> indicates that the chat program should
  send an EOT character to the remote. This is normally the End-of-file
  character sequence. A return character is not sent following the EOT. The EOT
  sequence may be embedded into the send string using the sequence <i>^D</i>.
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="GENERATING_BREAK"><a class="permalink" href="#GENERATING_BREAK">GENERATING
  BREAK</a></h1>
The special reply string of <i>BREAK</i> will cause a break condition to be
  sent. The break is a special signal on the transmitter. The normal processing
  on the receiver is to change the transmission rate. It may be used to cycle
  through the available transmission rates on the remote until you are able to
  receive a valid login prompt. The break sequence may be embedded into the send
  string using the <i>\K</i> sequence.
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="ESCAPE_SEQUENCES"><a class="permalink" href="#ESCAPE_SEQUENCES">ESCAPE
  SEQUENCES</a></h1>
The expect and reply strings may contain escape sequences. All of the sequences
  are legal in the reply string. Many are legal in the expect. Those which are
  not valid in the expect sequence are so indicated.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>''</b></dt>
  <dd>Expects or sends a null string. If you send a null string then it will
      still send the return character. This sequence may either be a pair of
      apostrophe or quote characters.</dd>
  <dt><b>\b</b></dt>
  <dd>represents a backspace character.</dd>
  <dt><b>\c</b></dt>
  <dd>Suppresses the newline at the end of the reply string. This is the only
      method to send a string without a trailing return character. It must be at
      the end of the send string. For example, the sequence hello\c will simply
      send the characters h, e, l, l, o. <i>(not valid in expect.)</i></dd>
  <dt><b>\d</b></dt>
  <dd>Delay for one second. The program uses sleep(1) which will delay to a
      maximum of one second. <i>(not valid in expect.)</i></dd>
  <dt><b>\K</b></dt>
  <dd>Insert a BREAK <i>(not valid in expect.)</i></dd>
  <dt><b>
  </b></dt>
  <dd>Send a newline or linefeed character.</dd>
  <dt><b>\N</b></dt>
  <dd>Send a null character. The same sequence may be represented by \0. <i>(not
      valid in expect.)</i></dd>
  <dt><b>\p</b></dt>
  <dd>Pause for a fraction of a second. The delay is 1/10th of a second. <i>(not
      valid in expect.)</i></dd>
  <dt><b>\q</b></dt>
  <dd>Suppress writing the string to the SYSLOG file. The string ?????? is
      written to the log in its place. <i>(not valid in expect.)</i></dd>
  <dt><b>\r</b></dt>
  <dd>Send or expect a carriage return.</dd>
  <dt><b>\s</b></dt>
  <dd>Represents a space character in the string. This may be used when it is
      not desirable to quote the strings which contains spaces. The sequence 'HI
      TIM' and HI\sTIM are the same.</dd>
  <dt><b>\t</b></dt>
  <dd>Send or expect a tab character.</dd>
  <dt><b>\T</b></dt>
  <dd>Send the phone number string as specified with the <i>-T</i> option
      <i>(not valid in expect.)</i></dd>
  <dt><b>\U</b></dt>
  <dd>Send the phone number 2 string as specified with the <i>-U</i> option
      <i>(not valid in expect.)</i></dd>
  <dt><b></b></dt>
  <dd>Send or expect a backslash character.</dd>
  <dt><b>\ddd</b></dt>
  <dd>Collapse the octal digits (ddd) into a single ASCII character and send
      that character. <i>(some characters are not valid in expect.)</i></dd>
  <dt><b>^C</b></dt>
  <dd>Substitute the sequence with the control character represented by C. For
      example, the character DC1 (17) is shown as ^Q. <i>(some characters are
      not valid in expect.)</i></dd>

<h1 class="Sh" id="ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES"><a class="permalink" href="#ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES">ENVIRONMENT
  VARIABLES</a></h1>
Environment variables are available within chat scripts, if the <i>-E</i> option
  was specified in the command line. The metacharacter <i>$</i> is used to
  introduce the name of the environment variable to substitute. If the
  substition fails, because the requested environment variable is not set,
  <i>nothing</i> is replaced for the variable.

The <i>chat</i> program will terminate with the following completion codes.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>0</b></dt>
  <dd>The normal termination of the program. This indicates that the script was
      executed without error to the normal conclusion.</dd>
  <dt><b>1</b></dt>

  <dt><b>2</b></dt>
  <dd>An error occurred during the execution of the program. This may be due to

<p class="Pp">Using the termination code, it is possible to determine which
    event terminated the script. It is possible to decide if the string
    &quot;BUSY&quot; was received from the modem as opposed to &quot;NO DIAL
    TONE&quot;. While the first event may be retried, the second will probably
    have little chance of succeeding during a retry.</p>
