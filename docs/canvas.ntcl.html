   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

[<span class="Op"><b>-closeenough</b> <i>closeEnough</i>]</span> Specifies a
  floating-point value indicating how close the mouse cursor must be to an item
  before it is considered to be &#x201C;inside&#x201D; the item. Defaults to
  1.0. [<span class="Op"><b>-confine</b> <i>confine</i>]</span> Specifies a
  boolean value that indicates whether or not it should be allowable to set the
  canvas's view outside the region defined by the <b>scrollRegion</b> argument.
  Defaults to true, which means that the view will be constrained within the
  scroll region. [<span class="Op"><b>-height</b> <i>height</i>]</span>
  Specifies a desired window height that the canvas widget should request from
  its geometry manager. The value may be specified in any of the forms described
  in the <b>COORDINATES</b> section below.
  [<span class="Op"><b>-scrollregion</b> <i>scrollRegion</i>]</span> Specifies a
  list with four coordinates describing the left, top, right, and bottom
  coordinates of a rectangular region. This region is used for scrolling
  purposes and is considered to be the boundary of the information in the
  canvas. Each of the coordinates may be specified in any of the forms given in
  the <b>COORDINATES</b> section below. [<span class="Op"><b>-state</b>
  <i>state</i>]</span> Modifies the default state of the canvas where
  <i>state</i> may be set to one of: <b>normal</b>, <b>disabled</b>, or
  <b>hidden</b>. Individual canvas objects all have their own state option which
  may override the default state. Many options can take separate specifications
  such that the appearance of the item can be different in different situations.
  The options that start with <b>active</b> control the appearance when the
  mouse pointer is over it, while the option starting with <b>disabled</b>
  controls the appearance when the state is disabled. Canvas items which are
  <b>disabled</b> will not react to canvas bindings.
  [<span class="Op"><b>-width</b> <i>width</i>]</span> Specifies a desired
  window width that the canvas widget should request from its geometry manager.
  The value may be specified in any of the forms described in the
  <b>COORDINATES</b> section below. [<span class="Op"><b>-xscrollincrement</b>
  <i>xScrollIncrement</i>]</span> Specifies an increment for horizontal
  scrolling, in any of the usual forms permitted for screen distances. If the
  value of this option is greater than zero, the horizontal view in the window
  will be constrained so that the canvas x coordinate at the left edge of the
  window is always an even multiple of <b>xScrollIncrement</b>; furthermore, the
  units for scrolling (e.g., the change in view when the left and right arrows
  of a scrollbar are selected) will also be <b>xScrollIncrement</b>. If the
  value of this option is less than or equal to zero, then horizontal scrolling
  is unconstrained. [<span class="Op"><b>-yscrollincrement</b>
  <i>yScrollIncrement</i>]</span> Specifies an increment for vertical scrolling,
  in any of the usual forms permitted for screen distances. If the value of this
  option is greater than zero, the vertical view in the window will be
  constrained so that the canvas y coordinate at the top edge of the window is
  always an even multiple of <b>yScrollIncrement</b>; furthermore, the units for
  scrolling (e.g., the change in view when the top and bottom arrows of a
  scrollbar are selected) will also be <b>yScrollIncrement</b>. If the value of
  this option is less than or equal to zero, then vertical scrolling is
  unconstrained.

The <b>canvas</b> command creates a new window (given by the <i>pathName</i>
  argument) and makes it into a canvas widget. Additional options, described
  above, may be specified on the command line or in the option database to
  configure aspects of the canvas such as its colors and 3-D relief. The
  <b>canvas</b> command returns its <i>pathName</i> argument. At the time this
  command is invoked, there must not exist a window named <i>pathName</i>, but
  <i>pathName</i>'s parent must exist.
<p class="Pp">Canvas widgets implement structured graphics. A canvas displays
    any number of <i>items</i>, which may be things like rectangles, circles,
    lines, and text. Items may be manipulated (e.g. moved or re-colored) and
    commands may be associated with items in much the same way that the
    <b>bind</b> command allows commands to be bound to widgets. For example, a
    particular command may be associated with the &lt;Button-1&gt; event so that
    the command is invoked whenever button 1 is pressed with the mouse cursor
    over an item. This means that items in a canvas can have behaviors defined
    by the Tcl scripts bound to them.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DISPLAY_LIST"><a class="permalink" href="#DISPLAY_LIST">DISPLAY
  LIST</a></h1>
The items in a canvas are ordered for purposes of display, with the first item
  in the display list being displayed first, followed by the next item in the
  list, and so on. Items later in the display list obscure those that are
  earlier in the display list and are sometimes referred to as being &#x201C;on
  top&#x201D; of earlier items. When a new item is created it is placed at the
  end of the display list, on top of everything else. Widget commands may be
  used to re-arrange the order of the display list.
<p class="Pp">Window items are an exception to the above rules. The underlying
    window systems require them always to be drawn on top of other items. In
    addition, the stacking order of window items is not affected by any of the
    canvas widget commands; you must use the <b>raise</b> and <b>lower</b> Tk
    commands instead.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="ITEM_IDS_AND_TAGS"><a class="permalink" href="#ITEM_IDS_AND_TAGS">ITEM
  IDS AND TAGS</a></h1>
Items in a canvas widget may be named in either of two ways: by id or by tag.
  Each item has a unique identifying number, which is assigned to that item when
  it is created. The id of an item never changes and id numbers are never
  re-used within the lifetime of a canvas widget.
<p class="Pp">Each item may also have any number of <i>tags</i> associated with
    it. A tag is just a string of characters, and it may take any form except
    that of an integer. For example, &#x201C;x123&#x201D; is OK but
    &#x201C;123&#x201D; is not. The same tag may be associated with many
    different items. This is commonly done to group items in various interesting
    ways; for example, all selected items might be given the tag
    &#x201C;selected&#x201D;.</p>
<p class="Pp">The tag <b>all</b> is implicitly associated with every item in the
    canvas; it may be used to invoke operations on all the items in the
  canvas.</p>
<p class="Pp">The tag <b>current</b> is managed automatically by Tk; it applies
    to the <i>current item</i>, which is the topmost item whose drawn area
    covers the position of the mouse cursor (different item types interpret this
    in varying ways; see the individual item type documentation for details). If
    the mouse is not in the canvas widget or is not over an item, then no item
    has the <b>current</b> tag.</p>
<p class="Pp">When specifying items in canvas widget commands, if the specifier
    is an integer then it is assumed to refer to the single item with that id.
    If the specifier is not an integer, then it is assumed to refer to all of
    the items in the canvas that have a tag matching the specifier. The symbol
    <i>tagOrId</i> is used below to indicate that an argument specifies either
    an id that selects a single item or a tag that selects zero or more
  items.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>tagOrId</i> may contain a logical expressions of tags by using
    operators: &#x201C;<b>&amp;&amp;</b>&#x201D;, &#x201C;<b>||</b>&#x201D;,
    &#x201C;<b>^</b>&#x201D;, &#x201C;<b>!</b>&#x201D;, and parenthesized
    subexpressions. For example:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
      .c find withtag {(a&amp;&amp;!b)||(!a&amp;&amp;b)}
</pre>
</div>
or equivalently:
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
      .c find withtag {a^b}
</pre>
</div>
will find only those items with either &#x201C;a&#x201D; or &#x201C;b&#x201D;
  tags, but not both.
<p class="Pp">Some widget commands only operate on a single item at a time; if
    <i>tagOrId</i> is specified in a way that names multiple items, then the
    normal behavior is for the command to use the first (lowest) of these items
    in the display list that is suitable for the command. Exceptions are noted
    in the widget command descriptions below.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="COORDINATES"><a class="permalink" href="#COORDINATES">COORDINATES</a></h1>
All coordinates related to canvases are stored as floating-point numbers.
  Coordinates and distances are specified in screen units, which are
  floating-point numbers optionally followed by one of several letters. If no
  letter is supplied then the distance is in pixels. If the letter is <b>m</b>
  then the distance is in millimeters on the screen; if it is <b>c</b> then the
  distance is in centimeters; <b>i</b> means inches, and <b>p</b> means printers
  points (1/72 inch). Larger y-coordinates refer to points lower on the screen;
  larger x-coordinates refer to points farther to the right. Coordinates can be
  specified either as an even number of parameters, or as a single list
  parameter containing an even number of x and y coordinate values.
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="TRANSFORMATIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#TRANSFORMATIONS">TRANSFORMATIONS</a></h2>
Normally the origin of the canvas coordinate system is at the upper-left corner
  of the window containing the canvas. It is possible to adjust the origin of
  the canvas coordinate system relative to the origin of the window using the
  <b>xview</b> and <b>yview</b> widget commands; this is typically used for
  scrolling. Canvases do not support scaling or rotation of the canvas
  coordinate system relative to the window coordinate system.
<p class="Pp">Individual items may be moved or scaled using widget commands
    described below, but they may not be rotated.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that the default origin of the canvas's visible area is
    coincident with the origin for the whole window as that makes bindings using
    the mouse position easier to work with; you only need to use the
    <b>canvasx</b> and <b>canvasy</b> widget commands if you adjust the origin
    of the visible area. However, this also means that any focus ring (as
    controlled by the <b>-highlightthickness</b> option) and window border (as
    controlled by the <b>-borderwidth</b> option) must be taken into account
    before you get to the visible area of the canvas.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="INDICES"><a class="permalink" href="#INDICES">INDICES</a></h1>
Text items support the notion of an <i>index</i> for identifying particular
  positions within the item. In a similar fashion, line and polygon items
  support <i>index</i> for identifying, inserting and deleting subsets of their
  coordinates. Indices are used for commands such as inserting or deleting a
  range of characters or coordinates, and setting the insertion cursor position.
  An index may be specified in any of a number of ways, and different types of
  items may support different forms for specifying indices. Text items support
  the following forms for an index; if you define new types of text-like items,
  it would be advisable to support as many of these forms as practical. Note
  that it is possible to refer to the character just after the last one in the
  text item; this is necessary for such tasks as inserting new text at the end
  of the item. Lines and Polygons do not support the insertion cursor and the
  selection. Their indices are supposed to be even always, because coordinates
  always appear in pairs.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><i>number</i></dt>
  <dd>A decimal number giving the position of the desired character within the
      text item. 0 refers to the first character, 1 to the next character, and
      so on. If indexes are odd for lines and polygons, they will be
      automatically decremented by one. A number less than 0 is treated as if it
      were zero, and a number greater than the length of the text item is
      treated as if it were equal to the length of the text item. For polygons,
      numbers less than 0 or greater then the length of the coordinate list will
      be adjusted by adding or subtracting the length until the result is
      between zero and the length, inclusive.</dd>
  <dt><b>end</b></dt>
  <dd>Refers to the character or coordinate just after the last one in the item
      (same as the number of characters or coordinates in the item).</dd>
  <dt><b>insert</b></dt>
  <dd>Refers to the character just before which the insertion cursor is drawn in
      this item. Not valid for lines and polygons.</dd>
  <dt><b>sel.first</b></dt>
  <dd>Refers to the first selected character in the item. If the selection is
      not in this item then this form is illegal.</dd>
  <dt><b>sel.last</b></dt>
  <dd>Refers to the last selected character in the item. If the selection is not
      in this item then this form is illegal.</dd>
  <dt><b>@</b><i>x,y</i></dt>
  <dd>Refers to the character or coordinate at the point given by <i>x</i> and
      <i>y</i>, where <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> are specified in the coordinate
      system of the canvas. If <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> lie outside the coordinates
      covered by the text item, then they refer to the first or last character
      in the line that is closest to the given point.</dd>
</dl>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DASH_PATTERNS"><a class="permalink" href="#DASH_PATTERNS">DASH
  PATTERNS</a></h1>
Many items support the notion of a dash pattern for outlines.
<p class="Pp">The first possible syntax is a list of integers. Each element
    represents the number of pixels of a line segment. Only the odd segments are
    drawn using the &#x201C;outline&#x201D; color. The other segments are drawn
    transparent.</p>
<p class="Pp">The second possible syntax is a character list containing only 5
    possible characters &#x201C;<b>.,-_ </b>&#x201D;. The space can be used to
    enlarge the space between other line elements, and cannot occur as the first
    position in the string. Some examples:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
-dash .     &#x2192; -dash {2 4}
-dash -     &#x2192; -dash {6 4}
-dash -.    &#x2192; -dash {6 4 2 4}
-dash -..   &#x2192; -dash {6 4 2 4 2 4}
-dash {. }  &#x2192; -dash {2 8}
-dash ,     &#x2192; -dash {4 4}
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The main difference of this syntax with the previous is that it is
    shape-conserving. This means that all values in the dash list will be
    multiplied by the line width before display. This assures that
    &#x201C;.&#x201D; will always be displayed as a dot and &#x201C;-&#x201D;
    always as a dash regardless of the line width.</p>
<p class="Pp">On systems which support only a limited set of dash patterns, the
    dash pattern will be displayed as the closest dash pattern that is
    available. For example, on Windows only the first 4 of the above examples
    are available. The last 2 examples will be displayed identically to the
    first one.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="WIDGET_COMMAND"><a class="permalink" href="#WIDGET_COMMAND">WIDGET
  COMMAND</a></h1>
The <b>canvas</b> command creates a new Tcl command whose name is
  <i>pathName</i>. This command may be used to invoke various operations on the
  widget. It has the following general form:
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<i>pathName option </i>?<i>arg arg ...</i>?
</pre>
</div>
<i>Option</i> and the <i>arg</i>s determine the exact behavior of the command.
  The following widget commands are possible for canvas widgets:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><i>pathName </i><b>addtag </b><i>tag searchSpec </i>?<i>arg arg
    ...</i>?</dt>
  <dd>For each item that meets the constraints specified by <i>searchSpec</i>
      and the <i>arg</i>s, add <i>tag</i> to the list of tags associated with
      the item if it is not already present on that list. It is possible that no
      items will satisfy the constraints given by <i>searchSpec</i> and
      <i>arg</i>s, in which case the command has no effect. This command returns
      an empty string as result. <i>SearchSpec</i> and <i>arg</i>'s may take any
      of the following forms:</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>above </b><i>tagOrId</i></dt>
  <dd>Selects the item just after (above) the one given by <i>tagOrId</i> in the
      display list. If <i>tagOrId</i> denotes more than one item, then the last
      (topmost) of these items in the display list is used.</dd>
  <dt><b>all</b></dt>
  <dd>Selects all the items in the canvas.</dd>
  <dt><b>below </b><i>tagOrId</i></dt>
  <dd>Selects the item just before (below) the one given by <i>tagOrId</i> in
      the display list. If <i>tagOrId</i> denotes more than one item, then the
      first (lowest) of these items in the display list is used.</dd>
  <dt><b>closest </b><i>x y </i>?<i>halo</i>? ?<i>start</i>?</dt>
  <dd>Selects the item closest to the point given by <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>. If
      more than one item is at the same closest distance (e.g. two items overlap
      the point), then the top-most of these items (the last one in the display
      list) is used. If <i>halo</i> is specified, then it must be a non-negative
      value. Any item closer than <i>halo</i> to the point is considered to
      overlap it. The <i>start</i> argument may be used to step circularly
      through all the closest items. If <i>start</i> is specified, it names an
      item using a tag or id (if by tag, it selects the first item in the
      display list with the given tag). Instead of selecting the topmost closest
      item, this form will select the topmost closest item that is below
      <i>start</i> in the display list; if no such item exists, then the
      selection behaves as if the <i>start</i> argument had not been
    specified.</dd>
  <dt><b>enclosed</b> <i>x1</i> <i>y1</i> <i>x2</i> <i>y2</i></dt>
  <dd>Selects all the items completely enclosed within the rectangular region
      given by <i>x1</i>, <i>y1</i>, <i>x2</i>, and <i>y2</i>. <i>X1</i> must be
      no greater then <i>x2</i> and <i>y1</i> must be no greater than
    <i>y2</i>.</dd>
  <dt><b>overlapping</b> <i>x1</i> <i>y1</i> <i>x2</i> <i>y2</i></dt>
  <dd>Selects all the items that overlap or are enclosed within the rectangular
      region given by <i>x1</i>, <i>y1</i>, <i>x2</i>, and <i>y2</i>. <i>X1</i>
      must be no greater then <i>x2</i> and <i>y1</i> must be no greater than
      <i>y2</i>.</dd>

      &#x201C;<i>x1 y1 x2 y2</i>&#x201D; such that the drawn areas of all the
      named elements are within the region bounded by <i>x1</i> on the left,
      <i>x2</i> on the right, <i>y1</i> on the top, and <i>y2</i> on the bottom.
      The return value may overestimate the actual bounding box by a few pixels.
      If no items match any of the <i>tagOrId</i> arguments or if the matching
      items have empty bounding boxes (i.e. they have nothing to display) then
      an empty string is returned.</dd>
  <dt><i>pathName </i><b>bind </b><i>tagOrId</i> ?<i>sequence</i>?
    ?<i>command</i>?</dt>
  <dd>This command associates <i>command</i> with all the items given by
      <i>tagOrId</i> such that whenever the event sequence given by
      <i>sequence</i> occurs for one of the items the command will be invoked.
      This widget command is similar to the <b>bind</b> command except that it
      operates on items in a canvas rather than entire widgets. See the
      <b>bind</b> manual entry for complete details on the syntax of
      <i>sequence</i> and the substitutions performed on <i>command</i> before
      invoking it. If all arguments are specified then a new binding is created,
      replacing any existing binding for the same <i>sequence</i> and
      <i>tagOrId</i> (if the first character of <i>command</i> is
      &#x201C;+&#x201D; then <i>command</i> augments an existing binding rather
      than replacing it). In this case the return value is an empty string. If
      <i>command</i> is omitted then the command returns the <i>command</i>
      associated with <i>tagOrId</i> and <i>sequence</i> (an error occurs if
      there is no such binding). If both <i>command</i> and <i>sequence</i> are
      omitted then the command returns a list of all the sequences for which
      bindings have been defined for <i>tagOrId</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">The only events for which bindings may be specified are those
    related to the mouse and keyboard (such as <b>Enter</b>, <b>Leave</b>,
    <b>ButtonPress</b>, <b>Motion</b>, and <b>KeyPress</b>) or virtual events.
    The handling of events in canvases uses the current item defined in <b>ITEM
    IDS AND TAGS</b> above. <b>Enter</b> and <b>Leave</b> events trigger for an
    item when it becomes the current item or ceases to be the current item; note
    that these events are different than <b>Enter</b> and <b>Leave</b> events
    for windows. Mouse-related events are directed to the current item, if any.
    Keyboard-related events are directed to the focus item, if any (see the
    <b>focus</b> widget command below for more on this). If a virtual event is
    used in a binding, that binding can trigger only if the virtual event is
    defined by an underlying mouse-related or keyboard-related event.</p>
<p class="Pp">It is possible for multiple bindings to match a particular event.
    This could occur, for example, if one binding is associated with the item's
    id and another is associated with one of the item's tags. When this occurs,
    all of the matching bindings are invoked. A binding associated with the
    <b>all</b> tag is invoked first, followed by one binding for each of the
    item's tags (in order), followed by a binding associated with the item's id.
    If there are multiple matching bindings for a single tag, then only the most
    specific binding is invoked. A <b>continue</b> command in a binding script
    terminates that script, and a <b>break</b> command terminates that script
    and skips any remaining scripts for the event, just as for the <b>bind</b>
    command.</p>
<p class="Pp">If bindings have been created for a canvas window using the
    <b>bind</b> command, then they are invoked in addition to bindings created
    for the canvas's items using the <b>bind</b> widget command. The bindings
    for items will be invoked before any of the bindings for the window as a
    whole.</p>

      marked as safe, the operation will fail because safe interpreters are not
      allowed to write files. If the <b>-channel</b> option is specified, the
      argument denotes the name of a channel already opened for writing. The
      Postscript is written to that channel, and the channel is left open for
      further writing at the end of the operation. The Postscript is created in
      Encapsulated Postscript form using version 3.0 of the Document Structuring
      Conventions. Note: by default Postscript is only generated for information
      that appears in the canvas's window on the screen. If the canvas is
      freshly created it may still have its initial size of 1x1 pixel so nothing
      will appear in the Postscript. To get around this problem either invoke
      the <b>update</b> command to wait for the canvas window to reach its final
      size, or else use the <b>-width</b> and <b>-height</b> options to specify
      the area of the canvas to print. The <i>option</i>-<i>value</i> argument
      pairs provide additional information to control the generation of
      Postscript. The following options are supported:</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">

      &#x201C;<b>1.0 1.0 0.0 setrgbcolor</b>&#x201D;). When outputting color
      information in the Postscript, Tk checks to see if there is an element of
      <i>varName</i> with the same name as the color. If so, Tk uses the value
      of the element as the Postscript command to set the color. If this option
      has not been specified, or if there is no entry in <i>varName</i> for a
      given color, then Tk uses the red, green, and blue intensities from the X

      or white).</dd>
  <dt><b>-file </b><i>fileName</i></dt>

  <dt><b>-fontmap </b><i>varName</i></dt>
  <dd><i>VarName</i> must be the name of an array variable that specifies a font
      mapping to use in the Postscript. Each element of <i>varName</i> must
      consist of a Tcl list with two elements, which are the name and point size
      of a Postscript font. When outputting Postscript commands for a particular
      font, Tk checks to see if <i>varName</i> contains an element with the same
      name as the font. If there is such an element, then the font information
      contained in that element is used in the Postscript. Otherwise Tk attempts
      to guess what Postscript font to use. Tk's guesses generally only work for
      well-known fonts such as Times and Helvetica and Courier, and only if the
      X font name does not omit any dashes up through the point size. For
      example, <b>-*-Courier-Bold-R-Normal--*-120-*</b> will work but
      <b>*Courier-Bold-R-Normal*120*</b> will not; Tk needs the dashes to parse
      the font name).</dd>

      <i>y</i> are the coordinates of the mouse. It returns an empty
    string.</dd>
  <dt><i>pathName </i><b>scan dragto </b><i>x y ?gain?</i>.</dt>
  <dd>This command computes the difference between its <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>
      arguments (which are typically mouse coordinates) and the <i>x</i> and
      <i>y</i> arguments to the last <b>scan mark</b> command for the widget. It
      then adjusts the view by <i>gain</i> times the difference in coordinates,
      where <i>gain</i> defaults to 10. This command is typically associated
      with mouse motion events in the widget, to produce the effect of dragging
      the canvas at high speed through its window. The return value is an empty
      string.</dd>

  <dt><i>pathName </i><b>select </b><i>option</i> ?<i>tagOrId arg</i>?</dt>
  <dd>Manipulates the selection in one of several ways, depending on
      <i>option</i>. The command may take any of the forms described below. In
      all of the descriptions below, <i>tagOrId</i> must refer to an item that
      supports indexing and selection; if it refers to multiple items then the
      first of these that supports indexing and the selection is used.
      <i>Index</i> gives a textual description of a position within

      given by <i>index</i>, and adjust that end of the selection to be at
      <i>index</i> (i.e. including but not going beyond <i>index</i>). The other
      end of the selection is made the anchor point for future <b>select to</b>
      commands. If the selection is not currently in <i>tagOrId</i> then this

<h1 class="Sh" id="OVERVIEW_OF_ITEM_TYPES"><a class="permalink" href="#OVERVIEW_OF_ITEM_TYPES">OVERVIEW
  OF ITEM TYPES</a></h1>
The sections below describe the various types of items supported by canvas
  widgets. Each item type is characterized by two things: first, the form of the
  <b>create</b> command used to create instances of the type; and second, a set
  of configuration options for items of that type, which may be used in the
  <b>create</b> and <b>itemconfigure</b> widget commands. Most items do not
  support indexing or selection or the commands related to them, such as
  <b>index</b> and <b>insert</b>. Where items do support these facilities, it is
  noted explicitly in the descriptions below. At present, text, line and polygon
  items provide this support. For lines and polygons the indexing facility is
  used to manipulate the coordinates of the item.
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="COMMON_ITEM_OPTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#COMMON_ITEM_OPTIONS">COMMON

<h1 class="Sh" id="ARC_ITEMS"><a class="permalink" href="#ARC_ITEMS">ARC
  ITEMS</a></h1>
Items of type <b>arc</b> appear on the display as arc-shaped regions. An arc is
  a section of an oval delimited by two angles (specified by the <b>-start</b>
  and <b>-extent</b> options) and displayed in one of several ways (specified by
  the <b>-style</b> option). Arcs are created with widget commands of the
  following form:
<div class="Bd-indent">

<i>pathName </i><b>create arc </b><i>x1 y1 x2 y2 </i>?<i>option value option value ...</i>?
<i>pathName </i><b>create arc </b><i>coordList</i> ?<i>option value option value ...</i>?
</pre>
</div>
The arguments <i>x1</i>, <i>y1</i>, <i>x2</i>, and <i>y2</i> or <i>coordList</i>
  give the coordinates of two diagonally opposite corners of a rectangular
  region enclosing the oval that defines the arc. After the coordinates there
  may be any number of <i>option</i>-<i>value</i> pairs, each of which sets one
  of the configuration options for the item. These same
  <i>option</i>-<i>value</i> pairs may be used in <b>itemconfigure</b> widget
  commands to change the item's configuration. An arc item becomes the current
  item when the mouse pointer is over any part that is painted or (when fully
  transparent) that would be painted if both the <b>-fill</b> and
  <b>-outline</b> options were non-empty.

      negative. If it is greater than 360 or less than -360, then <i>degrees</i>
      modulo 360 is used as the extent.</dd>
  <dt><b>-start </b><i>degrees</i></dt>
  <dd>Specifies the beginning of the angular range occupied by the arc.
      <i>Degrees</i> is given in units of degrees measured counter-clockwise
      from the 3-o'clock position; it may be either positive or negative.</dd>
  <dt><b>-style </b><i>type</i></dt>
  <dd>Specifies how to draw the arc. If <i>type</i> is <b>pieslice</b> (the
      default) then the arc's region is defined by a section of the oval's
      perimeter plus two line segments, one between the center of the oval and
      each end of the perimeter section. If <i>type</i> is <b>chord</b> then the
      arc's region is defined by a section of the oval's perimeter plus a single
      line segment connecting the two end points of the perimeter section. If
      <i>type</i> is <b>arc</b> then the arc's region consists of a section of
      the perimeter alone. In this last case the <b>-fill</b> option is

The following extra options are supported for lines:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>-arrow </b><i>where</i></dt>
  <dd>Indicates whether or not arrowheads are to be drawn at one or both ends of
      the line. <i>Where</i> must have one of the values <b>none</b> (for no
      arrowheads), <b>first</b> (for an arrowhead at the first point of the
      line), <b>last</b> (for an arrowhead at the last point of the line), or
      <b>both</b> (for arrowheads at both ends). This option defaults to
      <b>none</b>.</dd>
  <dt><b>-arrowshape </b><i>shape</i></dt>
  <dd>This option indicates how to draw arrowheads. The <i>shape</i> argument
      must be a list with three elements, each specifying a distance in any of
      the forms described in the <b>COORDINATES</b> section above. The first
      element of the list gives the distance along the line from the neck of the
      arrowhead to its tip. The second element gives the distance along the line
      from the trailing points of the arrowhead to the tip, and the third
      element gives the distance from the outside edge of the line to the
      trailing points. If this option is not specified then Tk picks a
      &#x201C;reasonable&#x201D; shape.</dd>
  <dt><b>-capstyle </b><i>style</i></dt>
  <dd>Specifies the ways in which caps are to be drawn at the endpoints of the
      line. <i>Style</i> may have any of the forms accepted by
      <b>Tk_GetCapStyle</b> (<b>butt</b>, <b>projecting</b>, or <b>round</b>).
      If this option is not specified then it defaults to <b>butt</b>. Where
      arrowheads are drawn the cap style is ignored.</dd>
  <dt><b>-joinstyle </b><i>style</i></dt>
  <dd>Specifies the ways in which joints are to be drawn at the vertices of the
      line. <i>Style</i> may have any of the forms accepted by
      <b>Tk_GetCapStyle</b> (<b>bevel</b>, <b>miter</b>, or <b>round</b>). If
      this option is not specified then it defaults to <b>round</b>. If the line
      only contains two points then this option is irrelevant.</dd>
  <dt><b>-smooth </b><i>smoothMethod</i></dt>
  <dd><i>smoothMethod</i> must have one of the forms accepted by
      <b>Tcl_GetBoolean</b> or a line smoothing method. Only <b>true</b> and
      <b>raw</b> are supported in the core (with <b>bezier</b> being an alias
      for <b>true</b>), but more can be added at runtime. If a boolean false
      value or empty string is given, no smoothing is applied. A boolean truth
      value assumes <b>true</b> smoothing. If the smoothing method is
      <b>true</b>, this indicates that the line should be drawn as a curve,
      rendered as a set of quadratic splines: one spline is drawn for the first
      and second line segments, one for the second and third, and so on.
      Straight-line segments can be generated within a curve by duplicating the
      end-points of the desired line segment. If the smoothing method is
      <b>raw</b>, this indicates that the line should also be drawn as a curve
      but where the list of coordinates is such that the first coordinate pair
      (and every third coordinate pair thereafter) is a knot point on a cubic
      Bezier curve, and the other coordinates are control points on the cubic
      Bezier curve. Straight line segments can be generated within a curve by
      making control points equal to their neighbouring knot points. If the last
      point is a control point and not a knot point, the point is repeated (one
      or two times) so that it also becomes a knot point.</dd>
  <dt><b>-splinesteps </b><i>number</i></dt>
  <dd>Specifies the degree of smoothness desired for curves: each spline will be
      approximated with <i>number</i> line segments. This option is ignored
      unless the <b>-smooth</b> option is true or <b>raw</b>.</dd>

  ITEMS</a></h1>
Items of type <b>oval</b> appear as circular or oval regions on the display.
  Each oval may have an outline, a fill, or both. Ovals are created with widget
  commands of the following form:
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<i>pathName </i><b>create oval </b><i>x1 y1 x2 y2 </i>?<i>option value option value ...</i>?
<i>pathName </i><b>create oval </b><i>coordList</i> ?<i>option value option value ...</i>?
</pre>
</div>
The arguments <i>x1</i>, <i>y1</i>, <i>x2</i>, and <i>y2</i> or <i>coordList</i>
  give the coordinates of two diagonally opposite corners of a rectangular
  region enclosing the oval. The oval will include the top and left edges of the
  rectangle not the lower or right edges. If the region is square then the
  resulting oval is circular; otherwise it is elongated in shape. After the
  coordinates there may be any number of <i>option</i>-<i>value</i> pairs, each
  of which sets one of the configuration options for the item. These same
  <i>option</i>-<i>value</i> pairs may be used in <b>itemconfigure</b> widget
  commands to change the item's configuration. An oval item becomes the current
  item when the mouse pointer is over any part that is painted or (when fully
  transparent) that would be painted if both the <b>-fill</b> and
  <b>-outline</b> options were non-empty.

<h1 class="Sh" id="POLYGON_ITEMS"><a class="permalink" href="#POLYGON_ITEMS">POLYGON
  ITEMS</a></h1>
Items of type <b>polygon</b> appear as polygonal or curved filled regions on the
  display. Polygon items support coordinate indexing operations using the canvas
  widget commands: <b>dchars, index, insert.</b> Polygons are created with
  widget commands of the following form:
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<i>pathName </i><b>create polygon </b><i>x1 y1 ... xn yn </i>?<i>option value option value ...</i>?
<i>pathName </i><b>create polygon </b><i>coordList</i> ?<i>option value option value ...</i>?
</pre>
</div>
The arguments <i>x1</i> through <i>yn</i> or <i>coordList</i> specify the
  coordinates for three or more points that define a polygon. The first point
  should not be repeated as the last to close the shape; Tk will automatically
  close the periphery between the first and last points. After the coordinates
  there may be any number of <i>option</i>-<i>value</i> pairs, each of which
  sets one of the configuration options for the item. These same
  <i>option</i>-<i>value</i> pairs may be used in <b>itemconfigure</b> widget
  commands to change the item's configuration. A polygon item is the current
  item whenever the mouse pointer is over any part of the polygon, whether drawn
  or not and whether or not the outline is smoothed.

<p class="Pp">Polygon items are different from other items such as rectangles,
    ovals and arcs in that interior points are considered to be
    &#x201C;inside&#x201D; a polygon (e.g. for purposes of the <b>find
    closest</b> and <b>find overlapping</b> widget commands) even if it is not
    filled. For most other item types, an interior point is considered to be
    inside the item only if the item is filled or if it has neither a fill nor
    an outline. If you would like an unfilled polygon whose interior points are
    not considered to be inside the polygon, use a line item instead.</p>

A text item displays a string of characters on the screen in one or more lines.
  Text items support indexing and selection, along with the following
  text-related canvas widget commands: <b>dchars</b>, <b>focus</b>,
  <b>icursor</b>, <b>index</b>, <b>insert</b>, <b>select</b>. Text items are

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>-anchor </b><i>anchorPos</i></dt>
  <dd><i>AnchorPos</i> tells how to position the text relative to the
      positioning point for the text; it may have any of the forms accepted by

      then the text is centered on the point; if <i>anchorPos</i> is <b>n</b>
      then the text will be drawn such that the top center point of the
      rectangular region occupied by the text will be at the positioning point.
      This option defaults to <b>center</b>.</dd>
  <dt><b>-font </b><i>fontName</i></dt>
  <dd>Specifies the font to use for the text item. <i>FontName</i> may be any
      string acceptable to <b>Tk_GetFont</b>. If this option is not specified,
      it defaults to a system-dependent font.</dd>
  <dt><b>-justify </b><i>how</i></dt>
  <dd>Specifies how to justify the text within its bounding region. <i>How</i>
      must be one of the values <b>left</b>, <b>right</b>, or <b>center</b>.
      This option will only matter if the text is displayed as multiple lines.
      If the option is omitted, it defaults to <b>left</b>.</dd>
  <dt><b>-text </b><i>string</i></dt>
  <dd><i>String</i> specifies the characters to be displayed in the text item.
      Newline characters cause line breaks. The characters in the item may also

  <dt><b>-underline </b><i></i></dt>
  <dd>Specifies the integer index of a character within the text to be
      underlined. 0 corresponds to the first character of the text displayed, 1

      drawn (if the whole text item is to be underlined, the appropriate font
      should be used instead).</dd>
  <dt><b>-width </b><i>lineLength</i></dt>
  <dd>Specifies a maximum line length for the text, in any of the forms
      described in the <b>COORDINATES</b> section above. If this option is zero
      (the default) the text is broken into lines only at newline characters.
      However, if this option is non-zero then any line that would be longer
      than <i>lineLength</i> is broken just before a space character to make the
      line shorter than <i>lineLength</i>; the space character is treated as if

<h1 class="Sh" id="WINDOW_ITEMS"><a class="permalink" href="#WINDOW_ITEMS">WINDOW
  ITEMS</a></h1>
Items of type <b>window</b> cause a particular window to be displayed at a given
  position on the canvas. Window items are created with widget commands of the
  following form:
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<i>pathName </i><b>create window </b><i>x y </i>?<i>option value option value ...</i>?
<i>pathName </i><b>create window </b><i>coordList</i> ?<i>option value option value ...</i>?
</pre>
</div>
The arguments <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> or <i>coordList</i> (which must have two
  elements) specify the coordinates of a point used to position the window on
  the display (see the <b>-anchor</b> option below for more information on how
  bitmaps are displayed). After the coordinates there may be any number of
  <i>option</i>-<i>value</i> pairs, each of which sets one of the configuration
  options for the item. These same <i>option</i>-<i>value</i> pairs may be used
  in <b>itemconfigure</b> widget commands to change the item's configuration.
  Theoretically, a window item becomes the current item when the mouse pointer
  is over any part of its bounding box, but in practice this typically does not
  happen because the mouse pointer ceases to be over the canvas at that point.
<p class="Pp">The following standard options are supported by window items:</p>

  <dd><i>AnchorPos</i> tells how to position the window relative to the
      positioning point for the item; it may have any of the forms accepted by
      <b>Tk_GetAnchor</b>. For example, if <i>anchorPos</i> is <b>center</b>
      then the window is centered on the point; if <i>anchorPos</i> is <b>n</b>
      then the window will be drawn so that its top center point is at the
      positioning point. This option defaults to <b>center</b>.</dd>
  <dt><b>-height </b><i>pixels</i></dt>
  <dd>Specifies the height to assign to the item's window. <i>Pixels</i> may
      have any of the forms described in the <b>COORDINATES</b> section above.
      If this option is not specified, or if it is specified as zero, then the
      window is given whatever height it requests internally.</dd>
  <dt><b>-width </b><i>pixels</i></dt>
  <dd>Specifies the width to assign to the item's window. <i>Pixels</i> may have
      any of the forms described in the <b>COORDINATES</b> section above. If
      this option is not specified, or if it is specified as zero, then the
      window is given whatever width it requests internally.</dd>
  <dt><b>-window </b><i>pathName</i></dt>
  <dd>Specifies the window to associate with this item. The window specified by
      <i>pathName</i> must either be a child of the canvas widget or a child of
      some ancestor of the canvas widget. <i>PathName</i> may not refer to a
      top-level window.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Note: due to restrictions in the ways that windows are managed, it
    is not possible to draw other graphical items (such as lines and images) on
    top of window items. A window item always obscures any graphics that overlap
    it, regardless of their order in the display list. Also note that window
    items, unlike other canvas items, are not clipped for display by their
    containing canvas's border, and are instead clipped by the parent widget of
    the window specified by the <b>-window</b> option; when the parent widget is
    the canvas, this means that the window item can overlap the canvas's
  border.</p>
