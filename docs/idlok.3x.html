<p class="Pp">These routines set options that change the style of output within
    <b>curses</b>. All options are initially <b>FALSE</b>, unless otherwise
    stated. It is not necessary to turn these options off before calling
    <b>endwin</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <b>clearok</b> is called with <b>TRUE</b> as argument, the next
    call to <b>wrefresh</b> with this window will clear the screen completely
    and redraw the entire screen from scratch. This is useful when the contents
    of the screen are uncertain, or in some cases for a more pleasing visual
    effect. If the <i>win</i> argument to <b>clearok</b> is the global variable
    <b>curscr</b>, the next call to <b>wrefresh</b> with any window causes the
    screen to be cleared and repainted from scratch.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <b>idlok</b> is called with <b>TRUE</b> as second argument,
    <b>curses</b> considers using the hardware insert/delete line feature of
    terminals so equipped. Calling <b>idlok</b> with <b>FALSE</b> as second
    argument disables use of line insertion and deletion. This option should be
    enabled only if the application needs insert/delete line, for example, for a
    screen editor. It is disabled by default because insert/delete line tends to
    be visually annoying when used in applications where it is not really
    needed. If insert/delete line cannot be used, <b>curses</b> redraws the
    changed portions of all lines.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <b>idcok</b> is called with <b>FALSE</b> as second argument,
    <b>curses</b> no longer considers using the hardware insert/delete character
    feature of terminals so equipped. Use of character insert/delete is enabled
    by default. Calling <b>idcok</b> with <b>TRUE</b> as second argument
    re-enables use of character insertion and deletion.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <b>immedok</b> is called with <b>TRUE as argument</b>, any
    change in the window image, such as the ones caused by <b>waddch, wclrtobot,
    wscrl</b>, etc., automatically cause a call to <b>wrefresh</b>. However, it
    may degrade performance considerably, due to repeated calls to
    <b>wrefresh</b>. It is disabled by default.</p>
<p class="Pp">Normally, the hardware cursor is left at the location of the
    window cursor being refreshed. The <b>leaveok</b> option allows the cursor
    to be left wherever the update happens to leave it. It is useful for
    applications where the cursor is not used, since it reduces the need for
    cursor motions.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>setscrreg</b> and <b>wsetscrreg</b> routines allow the
    application programmer to set a software scrolling region in a window.
    <i>top</i> and <i>bot</i> are the line numbers of the top and bottom margin
    of the scrolling region. (Line 0 is the top line of the window.) If this
    option and <b>scrollok</b> are enabled, an attempt to move off the bottom
    margin line causes all lines in the scrolling region to scroll one line in
    the direction of the first line. Only the text of the window is scrolled.
    (Note that this has nothing to do with the use of a physical scrolling
    region capability in the terminal, like that in the VT100. If <b>idlok</b>
    is enabled and the terminal has either a scrolling region or insert/delete
    line capability, they will probably be used by the output routines.)</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>scrollok</b> option controls what happens when the cursor
    of a window is moved off the edge of the window or scrolling region, either
    as a result of a newline action on the bottom line, or typing the last
    character of the last line. If disabled, (<i>bf</i> is <b>FALSE</b>), the
    cursor is left on the bottom line. If enabled, (<i>bf</i> is <b>TRUE</b>),
    the window is scrolled up one line (Note that to get the physical scrolling
    effect on the terminal, it is also necessary to call <b>idlok</b>).</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>nl</b> and <b>nonl</b> routines control whether the
    underlying display device translates the return key into newline on input,
    and whether it translates newline into return and line-feed on output (in
    either case, the call <b>addch('\n')</b> does the equivalent of return and
    line feed on the virtual screen). Initially, these translations do occur. If
    you disable them using <b>nonl</b>, <b>curses</b> will be able to make
    better use of the line-feed capability, resulting in faster cursor motion.
    Also, <b>curses</b> will then be able to detect the return key.</p>

<p class="Pp">The functions <b>setscrreg</b> and <b>wsetscrreg</b> return
    <b>OK</b> upon success and <b>ERR</b> upon failure. All other routines that
    return an integer always return <b>OK</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">X/Open does not define any error conditions.</p>

<p class="Pp">These functions are described in the XSI Curses standard, Issue
  4.</p>
<p class="Pp">The XSI Curses standard is ambiguous on the question of whether
    <b>raw</b>() should disable the CRLF translations controlled by <b>nl</b>()
    and <b>nonl</b>(). BSD curses did turn off these translations; AT&amp;T
    curses (at least as late as SVr1) did not. We choose to do so, on the theory
    that a programmer requesting raw input wants a clean (ideally 8-bit clean)
    connection that the operating system will not alter.</p>
<p class="Pp">Some historic curses implementations had, as an undocumented
    feature, the ability to do the equivalent of <b>clearok(..., 1)</b> by
    saying <b>touchwin(stdscr)</b> or <b>clear(stdscr)</b>. This will not work
    under ncurses.</p>
<p class="Pp">Earlier System V curses implementations specified that with
    <b>scrollok</b> enabled, any window modification triggering a scroll also
    forced a physical refresh. XSI Curses does not require this, and
    <b>ncurses</b> avoids doing it to perform better vertical-motion
    optimization at <b>wrefresh</b> time.</p>
<p class="Pp">The XSI Curses standard does not mention that the cursor should be
    made invisible as a side-effect of <b>leaveok</b>. SVr4 curses documentation
    does this, but the code does not. Use <b>curs_set</b> to make the cursor
    invisible.</p>
