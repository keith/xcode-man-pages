Annotates each line in the given file with information from the commit which
  introduced the line. Optionally annotates from a given revision.
<p class="Pp">The only difference between this command and <b>git-blame</b>(1)
    is that they use slightly different output formats, and this command exists
    only for backward compatibility to support existing scripts, and provide a
    more familiar command name for people coming from other SCM systems.</p>

<div class="Bd-indent">Show blank SHA-1 for boundary commits. This can also be
  controlled via the <b>blame.blankBoundary</b> config option.</div>
<p class="Pp">--root</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Do not treat root commits as boundaries. This can also be
  controlled via the <b>blame.showRoot</b> config option.</div>
<p class="Pp">--show-stats</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Include additional statistics at the end of blame
  output.</div>
<p class="Pp">-L &lt;start&gt;,&lt;end&gt;, -L :&lt;funcname&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Annotate only the line range given by
  <i>&lt;start&gt;,&lt;end&gt;</i>, or by the function name regex
  <i>&lt;funcname&gt;</i>. May be specified multiple times. Overlapping ranges
  are allowed.
<p class="Pp"><i>&lt;start&gt;</i> and <i>&lt;end&gt;</i> are optional. <b>-L
    &lt;start&gt;</b> or <b>-L &lt;start&gt;,</b> spans from
    <i>&lt;start&gt;</i> to end of file. <b>-L ,&lt;end&gt;</b> spans from start
    of file to <i>&lt;end&gt;</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>&lt;start&gt;</i> and <i>&lt;end&gt;</i> can take one of these
    forms:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;number
<p class="Pp">If <i>&lt;start&gt;</i> or <i>&lt;end&gt;</i> is a number, it
    specifies an absolute line number (lines count from 1).</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>/regex/</b>
<p class="Pp">This form will use the first line matching the given POSIX regex.
    If <i>&lt;start&gt;</i> is a regex, it will search from the end of the
    previous <b>-L</b> range, if any, otherwise from the start of file. If
    <i>&lt;start&gt;</i> is <b>^/regex/</b>, it will search from the start of
    file. If <i>&lt;end&gt;</i> is a regex, it will search starting at the line
    given by <i>&lt;start&gt;</i>.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;+offset or -offset
<p class="Pp">This is only valid for <i>&lt;end&gt;</i> and will specify a
    number of lines before or after the line given by <i>&lt;start&gt;</i>.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">If <b>:&lt;funcname&gt;</b> is given in place of
    <i>&lt;start&gt;</i> and <i>&lt;end&gt;</i>, it is a regular expression that
    denotes the range from the first funcname line that matches
    <i>&lt;funcname&gt;</i>, up to the next funcname line.
    <b>:&lt;funcname&gt;</b> searches from the end of the previous <b>-L</b>
    range, if any, otherwise from the start of file. <b>^:&lt;funcname&gt;</b>
    searches from the start of file. The function names are determined in the
    same way as <b>git diff</b> works out patch hunk headers (see <i>Defining a
    custom hunk-header</i> in <b>gitattributes</b>(5)).</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">-l</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show long rev (Default: off).</div>
<p class="Pp">-t</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show raw timestamp (Default: off).</div>
<p class="Pp">-S &lt;revs-file&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Use revisions from revs-file instead of calling
  <b>git-rev-list</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">--reverse &lt;rev&gt;..&lt;rev&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Walk history forward instead of backward. Instead of
  showing the revision in which a line appeared, this shows the last revision in
  which a line has existed. This requires a range of revision like START..END
  where the path to blame exists in START. <b>git blame --reverse START</b> is
  taken as <b>git blame --reverse START..HEAD</b> for convenience.</div>
<p class="Pp">--first-parent</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Follow only the first parent commit upon seeing a merge
  commit. This option can be used to determine when a line was introduced to a
  particular integration branch, rather than when it was introduced to the
  history overall.</div>
<p class="Pp">-p, --porcelain</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show in a format designed for machine consumption.</div>
<p class="Pp">--line-porcelain</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show the porcelain format, but output commit information
  for each line, not just the first time a commit is referenced. Implies
  --porcelain.</div>
<p class="Pp">--incremental</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show the result incrementally in a format designed for
  machine consumption.</div>
<p class="Pp">--encoding=&lt;encoding&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Specifies the encoding used to output author names and
  commit summaries. Setting it to <b>none</b> makes blame output unconverted
  data. For more information see the discussion about encoding in the
  <b>git-log</b>(1) manual page.</div>
<p class="Pp">--contents &lt;file&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When &lt;rev&gt; is not specified, the command annotates
  the changes starting backwards from the working tree copy. This flag makes the
  command pretend as if the working tree copy has the contents of the named file
  (specify <b>-</b> to make the command read from the standard input).</div>
<p class="Pp">--date &lt;format&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Specifies the format used to output dates. If --date is
  not provided, the value of the blame.date config variable is used. If the
  blame.date config variable is also not set, the iso format is used. For
  supported values, see the discussion of the --date option at
  <b>git-log</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">--[no-]progress</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Progress status is reported on the standard error stream
  by default when it is attached to a terminal. This flag enables progress
  reporting even if not attached to a terminal. Can&#x2019;t use
  <b>--progress</b> together with <b>--porcelain</b> or
  <b>--incremental</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">-M[&lt;num&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Detect moved or copied lines within a file. When a commit
  moves or copies a block of lines (e.g. the original file has A and then B, and
  the commit changes it to B and then A), the traditional <i>blame</i> algorithm
  notices only half of the movement and typically blames the lines that were
  moved up (i.e. B) to the parent and assigns blame to the lines that were moved
  down (i.e. A) to the child commit. With this option, both groups of lines are
  blamed on the parent by running extra passes of inspection.
<p class="Pp">&lt;num&gt; is optional but it is the lower bound on the number of
    alphanumeric characters that Git must detect as moving/copying within a file
    for it to associate those lines with the parent commit. The default value is
    20.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">-C[&lt;num&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">In addition to <b>-M</b>, detect lines moved or copied
  from other files that were modified in the same commit. This is useful when
  you reorganize your program and move code around across files. When this
  option is given twice, the command additionally looks for copies from other
  files in the commit that creates the file. When this option is given three
  times, the command additionally looks for copies from other files in any
  commit.
<p class="Pp">&lt;num&gt; is optional but it is the lower bound on the number of
    alphanumeric characters that Git must detect as moving/copying between files
    for it to associate those lines with the parent commit. And the default
    value is 40. If there are more than one <b>-C</b> options given, the
    &lt;num&gt; argument of the last <b>-C</b> will take effect.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--ignore-rev &lt;rev&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Ignore changes made by the revision when assigning blame,
  as if the change never happened. Lines that were changed or added by an
  ignored commit will be blamed on the previous commit that changed that line or
  nearby lines. This option may be specified multiple times to ignore more than
  one revision. If the <b>blame.markIgnoredLines</b> config option is set, then
  lines that were changed by an ignored commit and attributed to another commit
  will be marked with a <b>?</b> in the blame output. If the
  <b>blame.markUnblamableLines</b> config option is set, then those lines
  touched by an ignored commit that we could not attribute to another revision
  are marked with a <i>*</i>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--ignore-revs-file &lt;file&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Ignore revisions listed in <b>file</b>, which must be in
  the same format as an <b>fsck.skipList</b>. This option may be repeated, and
  these files will be processed after any files specified with the
  <b>blame.ignoreRevsFile</b> config option. An empty file name,
  <b>&quot;&quot;</b>, will clear the list of revs from previously processed
  files.</div>
<p class="Pp">-h</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show help message.</div>
