<p class="Pp">Each file system object in a <code class="Nm">cpio</code> archive
    comprises a header record with basic numeric metadata followed by the full
    pathname of the entry and the file data. The header record stores a series
    of integer values that generally follow the fields in <var class="Va">struct
    stat</var>. (See <a class="Xr">stat(2)</a> for details.) The variants differ
    primarily in how they store those integers (binary, octal, or hexadecimal).
    The header is followed by the pathname of the entry (the length of the
    pathname is stored in the header) and any file data. The end of the archive
    is indicated by a special record with the pathname

<h2 class="Ss" id="PWB_format"><a class="permalink" href="#PWB_format">PWB
  format</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The PWB binary <code class="Nm">cpio</code> format is the original
    format, when cpio was introduced as part of the Programmer's Work Bench
    system, a variant of 6th Edition UNIX. It stores numbers as 2-byte and
    4-byte binary values. Each entry begins with a header in the following
    format:</p>
<div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent Li">
<pre>struct header_pwb_cpio {
        short   h_magic;
        short   h_dev;
        short   h_ino;
        short   h_mode;
        short   h_uid;
        short   h_gid;
        short   h_nlink;
        short   h_majmin;
        long    h_mtime;
        short   h_namesize;
        long    h_filesize;
};</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The <var class="Va">short</var> fields here are 16-bit integer
    values, while the <var class="Va">long</var> fields are 32 bit integers.
    Since PWB UNIX, like the 6th Edition UNIX it was based on, only ran on
    PDP-11 computers, they are in PDP-endian format, which has little-endian
    shorts, and big-endian longs. That is, the long integer whose hexadecimal
    representation is 0x12345678 would be stored in four successive bytes as
    0x34, 0x12, 0x78, 0x56. The fields are as follows:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="h_magic"><var class="Va">h_magic</var></dt>
  <dd>The integer value octal 070707.</dd>
  <dt id="h_dev"><var class="Va">h_dev</var>, <var class="Va">h_ino</var></dt>
  <dd>The device and inode numbers from the disk. These are used by programs
      that read <code class="Nm">cpio</code> archives to determine when two
      entries refer to the same file. Programs that synthesize
      <code class="Nm">cpio</code> archives should be careful to set these to
      distinct values for each entry.</dd>
  <dt id="h_mode"><var class="Va">h_mode</var></dt>
  <dd>The mode specifies both the regular permissions and the file type, and it
      also holds a couple of bits that are irrelevant to the cpio format,
      because the field is actually a raw copy of the mode field in the inode
      representing the file. These are the IALLOC flag, which shows that the
      inode entry is in use, and the ILARG flag, which shows that the file it
      represents is large enough to have indirect blocks pointers in the inode.
      The mode is decoded as follows:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <dl class="Bl-tag Bl-compact">
      <dt>0100000</dt>

  <dd>The numeric user id and group id of the owner.</dd>
  <dt id="h_nlink"><var class="Va">h_nlink</var></dt>
  <dd>The number of links to this file. Directories always have a value of at
      least two here. Note that hardlinked files include file data with every
      copy in the archive.</dd>
  <dt id="h_majmin"><var class="Va">h_majmin</var></dt>
  <dd>For block special and character special entries, this field contains the
      associated device number, with the major number in the high byte, and the
      minor number in the low byte. For all other entry types, it should be set
      to zero by writers and ignored by readers.</dd>

  <dd>The number of bytes in the pathname that follows the header. This count
      includes the trailing NUL byte.</dd>
  <dt id="h_filesize"><var class="Va">h_filesize</var></dt>
  <dd>The size of the file. Note that this archive format is limited to 16
      megabyte file sizes, because PWB UNIX, like 6th Edition, only used an
      unsigned 24 bit integer for the file size internally.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The pathname immediately follows the fixed header. If
    <code class="Cm">h_namesize</code> is odd, an additional NUL byte is added
    after the pathname. The file data is then appended, again with an additional
    NUL appended if needed to get the next header at an even offset.</p>
<p class="Pp">Hardlinked files are not given special treatment; the full file
    contents are included with each copy of the file.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="New_Binary_Format"><a class="permalink" href="#New_Binary_Format">New
  Binary Format</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The new binary <code class="Nm">cpio</code> format showed up when
    cpio was adopted into late 7th Edition UNIX. It is exactly like the PWB
    binary format, described above, except for three changes:</p>
<p class="Pp">First, UNIX now ran on more than one hardware type, so the
    endianness of 16 bit integers must be determined by observing the magic
    number at the start of the header. The 32 bit integers are still always
    stored with the most significant word first, though, so each of those two,
    in the struct shown above, was stored as an array of two 16 bit integers, in
    the traditional order. Those 16 bit integers, like all the others in the
    struct, were accessed using a macro that byte swapped them if necessary.</p>
<p class="Pp">Next, 7th Edition had more file types to store, and the IALLOC and
    ILARG flag bits were re-purposed to accommodate these. The revised use of
    the various bits is as follows:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<dl class="Bl-tag Bl-compact">
  <dt>0170000</dt>
  <dd>This masks the file type bits.</dd>
  <dt>0140000</dt>
  <dd>File type value for sockets.</dd>
  <dt>0120000</dt>
  <dd>File type value for symbolic links. For symbolic links, the link body is
      stored as file data.</dd>
  <dt>0100000</dt>
  <dd>File type value for regular files.</dd>
  <dt>0060000</dt>
  <dd>File type value for block special devices.</dd>
  <dt>0040000</dt>
  <dd>File type value for directories.</dd>
  <dt>0020000</dt>
  <dd>File type value for character special devices.</dd>
  <dt>0010000</dt>
  <dd>File type value for named pipes or FIFOs.</dd>
  <dt>0004000</dt>
  <dd>SUID bit.</dd>
  <dt>0002000</dt>
  <dd>SGID bit.</dd>
  <dt>0001000</dt>
  <dd>Sticky bit.</dd>
  <dt>0000777</dt>
  <dd>The lower 9 bits specify read/write/execute permissions for world, group,
      and user following standard POSIX conventions.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Finally, the file size field now represents a signed 32 bit
    integer in the underlying file system, so the maximum file size has
    increased to 2 gigabytes.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that there is no obvious way to tell which of the two binary
    formats an archive uses, other than to see which one makes more sense. The
    typical error scenario is that a PWB format archive unpacked as if it were
    in the new format will create named sockets instead of directories, and then
    fail to unpack files that should go in those directories. Running
    <var class="Va">bsdcpio -itv</var> on an unknown archive will make it
    obvious which it is: if it's PWB format, directories will be listed with an
    's' instead of a 'd' as the first character of the mode string, and the
    larger files will have a '?' in that position.</p>

    character&#x201D; format or as the &#x201C;odc&#x201D; format. It stores the
    same numeric fields as the old binary format, but represents them as
    6-character or 11-character octal values.</p>

<p class="Pp">The pathname is followed by NUL bytes so that the total size of
