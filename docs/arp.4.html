<p class="Pp">The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is a protocol used to
    dynamically map between Internet host addresses and 10Mb/s Ethernet
    addresses. It is used by all the 10Mb/s Ethernet interface drivers. It is
    not specific to Internet protocols or to 10Mb/s Ethernet, but this
    implementation currently supports only that combination.</p>
<p class="Pp">ARP caches Internet-Ethernet address mappings. When an interface
    requests a mapping for an address not in the cache, ARP queues the message
    which requires the mapping and broadcasts a message on the associated
    network requesting the address mapping. If a response is provided, the new
    mapping is cached and any pending message is transmitted. ARP will queue at
    most one packet while waiting for a response to a mapping request; only the
    most recently ``transmitted'' packet is kept. If the target host does not
    respond after several requests, the host is considered to be down for a
    short period (normally 20 seconds), allowing an error to be returned to
    transmission attempts during this interval. The error is
    <code class="Li">EHOSTDOWN</code> for a non-responding destination host, and
    <code class="Li">EHOSTUNREACH</code> for a non-responding router.</p>
<p class="Pp">The ARP cache is stored in the system routing table as
    dynamically-created host routes. The route to a directly-attached Ethernet
    network is installed as a &#x201C;cloning&#x201D; route (one with the
    <code class="Li">RTF_CLONING</code> flag set), causing routes to individual
    hosts on that network to be created on demand. These routes time out
    periodically (normally 20 minutes after validated; entries are not validated
    when not in use). An entry for a host which is not responding is a
    &#x201C;reject&#x201D; route (one with the
    <code class="Li">RTF_REJECT</code> flag set).</p>
<p class="Pp">ARP entries may be added, deleted or changed with the
    <a class="Xr">arp(8)</a> utility. Manually-added entries may be temporary or
    permanent, and may be &#x201C;published&#x201D;, in which case the system
    will respond to ARP requests for that host as if it were the target of the
    request.</p>
<p class="Pp">In the past, ARP was used to negotiate the use of a trailer
    encapsulation. This is no longer supported.</p>
<p class="Pp">ARP watches passively for hosts impersonating the local host (i.e.
    a host which responds to an ARP mapping request for the local host's
    address).</p>

    has discovered another host on the local network which responds to mapping
    requests for its own Internet address with a different Ethernet address,
    generally indicating that two hosts are attempting to use the same Internet
