This compiler backend prints the internal OPs of a Perl program's syntax tree in
  one of several space-efficient text formats suitable for debugging the inner
  workings of perl or other compiler backends. It can print OPs in the order
  they appear in the OP tree, in the order they will execute, or in a text
  approximation to their tree structure, and the format of the information
  displayed is customizable. Its function is similar to that of perl's
  <b>-Dx</b> debugging flag or the <b>B::Terse</b> module, but it is more
  sophisticated and flexible.

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="EXAMPLE"><a class="permalink" href="#EXAMPLE">EXAMPLE</a></h1>
Here's two outputs (or 'renderings'), using the -exec and -basic (i.e. default)
  formatting conventions on the same code snippet.
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    % perl -MO=Concise,-exec -e '$a = $b + 42'
    1  &lt;0&gt; enter
    2  &lt;;&gt; nextstate(main 1 -e:1) v
    3  &lt;#&gt; gvsv[*b] s
    4  &lt;$&gt; const[IV 42] s
 *  5  &lt;2&gt; add[t3] sK/2
    6  &lt;#&gt; gvsv[*a] s
    7  &lt;2&gt; sassign vKS/2
    8  &lt;@&gt; leave[1 ref] vKP/REFC
</pre>
<p class="Pp">In this -exec rendering, each opcode is executed in the order
    shown. The add opcode, marked with '*', is discussed in more detail.</p>
<p class="Pp">The 1st column is the op's sequence number, starting at 1, and is
    displayed in base 36 by default. Here they're purely linear; the sequences
    are very helpful when looking at code with loops and branches.</p>
<p class="Pp">The symbol between angle brackets indicates the op's type, for
    example; &lt;2&gt; is a BINOP, &lt;@&gt; a LISTOP, and &lt;#&gt; is a PADOP,
    which is used in threaded perls. (see &quot;OP class
  abbreviations&quot;).</p>
<p class="Pp">The opname, as in <b>'add[t1]'</b>, may be followed by op-specific
    information in parentheses or brackets (ex <b>'[t1]'</b>).</p>
<p class="Pp">The op-flags (ex <b>'sK/2'</b>) are described in (&quot;OP flags
    abbreviations&quot;).</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    % perl -MO=Concise -e '$a = $b + 42'
    8  &lt;@&gt; leave[1 ref] vKP/REFC -&gt;(end)
    1     &lt;0&gt; enter -&gt;2
    2     &lt;;&gt; nextstate(main 1 -e:1) v -&gt;3
    7     &lt;2&gt; sassign vKS/2 -&gt;8
 *  5        &lt;2&gt; add[t1] sK/2 -&gt;6
    -           &lt;1&gt; ex-rv2sv sK/1 -&gt;4
    3              &lt;$&gt; gvsv(*b) s -&gt;4
    4           &lt;$&gt; const(IV 42) s -&gt;5
    -        &lt;1&gt; ex-rv2sv sKRM*/1 -&gt;7
    6           &lt;$&gt; gvsv(*a) s -&gt;7
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The default rendering is top-down, so they're not in execution
    order. This form reflects the way the stack is used to parse and evaluate
    expressions; the add operates on the two terms below it in the tree.</p>
<p class="Pp">Nullops appear as <span class="Li">&quot;ex-opname&quot;</span>,
    where <i>opname</i> is an op that has been optimized away by perl. They're
    displayed with a sequence-number of '-', because they are not executed (they
    don't appear in previous example), they're printed here because they reflect
    the parse.</p>
<p class="Pp">The arrow points to the sequence number of the next op; they're
    not displayed in -exec mode, for obvious reasons.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that because this rendering was done on a non-threaded perl,
    the PADOPs in the previous examples are now SVOPs, and some (but not all) of
    the square brackets have been replaced by round ones. This is a subtle
    feature to provide some visual distinction between renderings on threaded
    and un-threaded perls.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
Arguments that don't start with a hyphen are taken to be the names of
  subroutines or formats to render; if no such functions are specified, the main
  body of the program (outside any subroutines, and not including use'd or
  require'd files) is rendered. Passing
  <span class="Li">&quot;BEGIN&quot;</span>,
  <span class="Li">&quot;UNITCHECK&quot;</span>,
  <span class="Li">&quot;CHECK&quot;</span>,
  <span class="Li">&quot;INIT&quot;</span>, or
  <span class="Li">&quot;END&quot;</span> will cause all of the corresponding
  special blocks to be printed. Arguments must follow options.
<p class="Pp">Options affect how things are rendered (ie printed). They're
    presented here by their visual effect, 1st being strongest. They're grouped
    according to how they interrelate; within each group the options are
    mutually exclusive (unless otherwise stated).</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Options_for_Opcode_Ordering"><a class="permalink" href="#Options_for_Opcode_Ordering">Options
  for Opcode Ordering</a></h2>
These options control the 'vertical display' of opcodes. The display 'order' is
  also called 'mode' elsewhere in this document.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>-basic</b></dt>
  <dd>Print OPs in the order they appear in the OP tree (a preorder traversal,
      starting at the root). The indentation of each OP shows its level in the
      tree, and the '-&gt;' at the end of the line indicates the next opcode in
      execution order. This mode is the default, so the flag is included simply
      for completeness.</dd>
  <dt><b>-exec</b></dt>
  <dd>Print OPs in the order they would normally execute (for the majority of
      constructs this is a postorder traversal of the tree, ending at the root).
      In most cases the OP that usually follows a given OP will appear directly
      below it; alternate paths are shown by indentation. In cases like loops
      when control jumps out of a linear path, a 'goto' line is generated.</dd>
  <dt><b>-tree</b></dt>
  <dd>Print OPs in a text approximation of a tree, with the root of the tree at
      the left and 'left-to-right' order of children transformed into
      'top-to-bottom'. Because this mode grows both to the right and down, it
      isn't suitable for large programs (unless you have a very wide
    terminal).</dd>

  <dd>Use the author's favorite set of formatting conventions. This is the
      default, of course.</dd>
  <dt><b>-terse</b></dt>
  <dd>Use formatting conventions that emulate the output of <b>B::Terse</b>. The
      basic mode is almost indistinguishable from the real <b>B::Terse</b>, and
      the exec mode looks very similar, but is in a more logical order and lacks
      curly brackets. <b>B::Terse</b> doesn't have a tree mode, so the tree mode
      is only vaguely reminiscent of <b>B::Terse</b>.</dd>
  <dt><b>-linenoise</b></dt>
  <dd>Use formatting conventions in which the name of each OP, rather than being
      written out in full, is represented by a one- or two-character
      abbreviation. This is mainly a joke.</dd>
  <dt><b>-debug</b></dt>

      few precious columns of screen real estate.</dd>
  <dt><b>-loose</b></dt>
  <dd>Use a tree format that uses longer edges to separate OP nodes. This format
      tends to look better than the compact one, especially in ASCII, and is the
      default.</dd>
  <dt><b>-vt</b></dt>
  <dd>Use tree connecting characters drawn from the VT100 line-drawing set. This
      looks better if your terminal supports it.</dd>
  <dt><b>-ascii</b></dt>
  <dd>Draw the tree with standard ASCII characters like
      <span class="Li">&quot;+&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;|&quot;</span>. These don't look as clean as the
      VT100 characters, but they'll work with almost any terminal (or the

<h1 class="Sh" id="FORMATTING_SPECIFICATIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#FORMATTING_SPECIFICATIONS">FORMATTING
  SPECIFICATIONS</a></h1>
For each line-style ('concise', 'terse', 'linenoise', etc.) there are 3
  format-specs which control how OPs are rendered.
<p class="Pp">The first is the 'default' format, which is used in both basic and
    exec modes to print all opcodes. The 2nd, goto-format, is used in exec mode
    when branches are encountered. They're not real opcodes, and are inserted to
    look like a closing curly brace. The tree-format is tree specific.</p>
<p class="Pp">When a line is rendered, the correct format-spec is copied and
    scanned for the following items; data is substituted in, and other
    manipulations like basic indenting are done, for each opcode rendered.</p>
<p class="Pp">There are 3 kinds of items that may be populated; special
    patterns, #vars, and literal text, which is copied verbatim. (Yes, it's a
    set of s///g steps.)</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Special_Patterns"><a class="permalink" href="#Special_Patterns">Special

These items are the primitives used to perform indenting, and to select text

<h2 class="Ss" id="__Variables"><a class="permalink" href="#__Variables">#
  Variables</a></h2>
These #vars represent opcode properties that you may want as part of your

  interpolated into the style-line, much like &quot;read

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>#</b><i>var</i></dt>
  <dd>A property named 'var' is assumed to exist for the opcodes, and is
      interpolated into the rendering.</dd>
  <dt><b>#</b><i>var</i><i>N</i></dt>
  <dd>Generates the value of <i>var</i>, left justified to fill <i>N</i> spaces.
      Note that this means while you can have properties 'foo' and 'foo2', you
      cannot render 'foo2', but you could with 'foo2a'. You would be wise not to
      rely on this behavior going forward ;-)</dd>
  <dt><b>#</b><i>Var</i></dt>
  <dd>This ucfirst form of #var generates a tag-value form of itself for
      display; it converts '#Var' into a 'Var =&gt; #var' style, which is then
      handled as described above. (Imp-note: #Vars cannot be used for
      conditional-fills, because the =&gt; #var transform is done after the
      check for #Var's value).</dd>

<p class="Pp">The following variables are 'defined' by B::Concise; when they are
    used in a style, their respective values are plugged into the rendering of

  B::Concise outside of the O framework</a></h1>
The common (and original) usage of B::Concise was for command-line renderings of
  simple code, as given in EXAMPLE. But you can also use <b>B::Concise</b> from
  your code, and call <b>compile()</b> directly, and repeatedly. By doing so,
  you can avoid the compile-time only operation of O.pm, and even use the
  debugger to step through <b>B::Concise::compile()</b> itself.
<p class="Pp">Once you're doing this, you may alter Concise output by adding new
    rendering styles, and by optionally adding callback routines which populate
    new variables, if such were referenced from those (just added) styles.</p>

<b>set_style</b> accepts 3 arguments, and updates the three format-specs
  comprising a line-style (basic-exec, goto, tree). It has one minor drawback
  though; it doesn't register the style under a new name. This can become an
  issue if you render more than once and switch styles. Thus you may prefer to
  use <b>add_style()</b> and/or <b>set_style_standard()</b> instead.
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="set_style_standard($name)"><a class="permalink" href="#set_style_standard($name)">set_style_standard($name)</a></h2>
This restores one of the standard line-styles:

  <span class="Li">&quot;concise&quot;</span>,
  <span class="Li">&quot;linenoise&quot;</span>,
  <span class="Li">&quot;debug&quot;</span>,

</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="add_style_()"><a class="permalink" href="#add_style_()">add_style
  ()</a></h2>
This subroutine accepts a new style name and three style arguments as above, and
  creates, registers, and selects the newly named style. It is an error to
  re-add a style; call <b>set_style_standard()</b> to switch between several
  styles.
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="add_callback_()"><a class="permalink" href="#add_callback_()">add_callback
  ()</a></h2>
If your newly minted styles refer to any new #variables, you'll need to define a
  callback subroutine that will populate (or modify) those variables. They are
  then available for use in the style you've chosen.
<p class="Pp">The callbacks are called for each opcode visited by Concise, in
    the same order as they are added. Each subroutine is passed five
  parameters.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  1. A hashref, containing the variable names and values which are
     populated into the report-line for the op
  2. the op, as a B&lt;B::OP&gt; object
  3. a reference to the format string
  4. the formatting (indent) level
  5. the selected stylename
</pre>
<p class="Pp">To define your own variables, simply add them to the hash, or
    change existing values if you need to. The level and format are passed in as
    references to scalars, but it is unlikely that they will need to be changed
    or even used.</p>

<b>compile</b> accepts options as described above in &quot;OPTIONS&quot;, and
  arguments, which are either coderefs, or subroutine names.
<p class="Pp">It constructs and returns a <span class="Li">$treewalker</span>
    coderef, which when invoked, traverses, or walks, and renders the optrees of
    the given arguments to STDOUT. You can reuse this, and can change the
    rendering style used each time; thereafter the coderef renders in the new
    style.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>walk_output</b> lets you change the print destination from
    STDOUT to another open filehandle, or into a string passed as a ref (unless
    you've built perl with -Uuseperlio).</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  my $walker = B::Concise::compile('-terse','aFuncName', \&amp;aSubRef); # 1
  walk_output(\my $buf);
  $walker-&gt;();                          # 1 renders -terse

  print &quot;3 different renderings: terse, concise, and @new: $buf\n&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">When <span class="Li">$walker</span> is called, it traverses the
    subroutines supplied when it was created, and renders them using the current
    style. You can change the style afterwards in several different ways:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  1. call C&lt;compile&gt;, altering style or mode/order
  2. call C&lt;set_style_standard&gt;
  3. call $walker, passing @new options
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Passing new options to the <span class="Li">$walker</span> is the
    easiest way to change amongst any pre-defined styles (the ones you add are
    automatically recognized as options), and is the only way to alter rendering
    order without calling compile again. Note however that rendering state is
    still shared amongst multiple <span class="Li">$walker</span> objects, so
    they must still be used in a coordinated manner.</p>

This function (not exported) lets you reset the sequence numbers (note that
  they're numbered arbitrarily, their goal being to be human readable). Its
  purpose is mostly to support testing, i.e. to compare the concise output from
  two identical anonymous subroutines (but different instances). Without the
  reset, B::Concise, seeing that they're separate optrees, generates different
  sequence numbers in the output.

    <b>walk_output()</b>, result in <b>die()</b>. Use an eval if you wish to
