<p class="Pp">This document describes the behavior and implementation of the
    PerlIO abstraction described in perlapio when
    <span class="Li">&quot;USE_PERLIO&quot;</span> is defined (and
    <span class="Li">&quot;USE_SFIO&quot;</span> is not).</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="History_and_Background"><a class="permalink" href="#History_and_Background">History
  and Background</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The PerlIO abstraction was introduced in perl5.003_02 but
    languished as just an abstraction until perl5.7.0. However during that time
    a number of perl extensions switched to using it, so the API is mostly fixed
    to maintain (source) compatibility.</p>
<p class="Pp">The aim of the implementation is to provide the PerlIO API in a
    flexible and platform neutral manner. It is also a trial of an &quot;Object
    Oriented C, with vtables&quot; approach which may be applied to Perl 6.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Basic_Structure"><a class="permalink" href="#Basic_Structure">Basic
  Structure</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">PerlIO is a stack of layers.</p>
<p class="Pp">The low levels of the stack work with the low-level operating
    system calls (file descriptors in C) getting bytes in and out, the higher
    layers of the stack buffer, filter, and otherwise manipulate the I/O, and
    return characters (or bytes) to Perl. Terms <i>above</i> and <i>below</i>
    are used to refer to the relative positioning of the stack layers.</p>
<p class="Pp">A layer contains a &quot;vtable&quot;, the table of I/O operations
    (at C level a table of function pointers), and status flags. The functions
    in the vtable implement operations like &quot;open&quot;, &quot;read&quot;,
    and &quot;write&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">When I/O, for example &quot;read&quot;, is requested, the request
    goes from Perl first down the stack using &quot;read&quot; functions of each
    layer, then at the bottom the input is requested from the operating system
    services, then the result is returned up the stack, finally being
    interpreted as Perl data.</p>
<p class="Pp">The requests do not necessarily go always all the way down to the
    operating system: that's where PerlIO buffering comes into play.</p>
<p class="Pp">When you do an <i>open()</i> and specify extra PerlIO layers to be
    deployed, the layers you specify are &quot;pushed&quot; on top of the
    already existing default stack. One way to see it is that &quot;operating
    system is on the left&quot; and &quot;Perl is on the right&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">What exact layers are in this default stack depends on a lot of
    things: your operating system, Perl version, Perl compile time
    configuration, and Perl runtime configuration. See PerlIO,
    &quot;PERLIO&quot; in perlrun, and open for more information.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>binmode()</i> operates similarly to <i>open()</i>: by default
    the specified layers are pushed on top of the existing stack.</p>
<p class="Pp">However, note that even as the specified layers are &quot;pushed
    on top&quot; for <i>open()</i> and <i>binmode()</i>, this doesn't mean that
    the effects are limited to the &quot;top&quot;: PerlIO layers can be very
    'active' and inspect and affect layers also deeper in the stack. As an
    example there is a layer called &quot;raw&quot; which repeatedly
    &quot;pops&quot; layers until it reaches the first layer that has declared
    itself capable of handling binary data. The &quot;pushed&quot; layers are
    processed in left-to-right order.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>sysopen()</i> operates (unsurprisingly) at a lower level in the
    stack than <i>open()</i>. For example in Unix or Unix-like systems
    <i>sysopen()</i> operates directly at the level of file descriptors: in the
    terms of PerlIO layers, it uses only the &quot;unix&quot; layer, which is a
    rather thin wrapper on top of the Unix file descriptors.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Layers_vs_Disciplines"><a class="permalink" href="#Layers_vs_Disciplines">Layers
  vs Disciplines</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Initial discussion of the ability to modify IO streams behaviour
    used the term &quot;discipline&quot; for the entities which were added. This
    came (I believe) from the use of the term in &quot;sfio&quot;, which in turn
    borrowed it from &quot;line disciplines&quot; on Unix terminals. However,
    this document (and the C code) uses the term &quot;layer&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">This is, I hope, a natural term given the implementation, and
    should avoid connotations that are inherent in earlier uses of
    &quot;discipline&quot; for things which are rather different.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Data_Structures"><a class="permalink" href="#Data_Structures">Data
  Structures</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The basic data structure is a PerlIOl:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        typedef struct _PerlIO PerlIOl;
        typedef struct _PerlIO_funcs PerlIO_funcs;
        typedef PerlIOl *PerlIO;
        struct _PerlIO
        {
         PerlIOl *      next;       /* Lower layer */
         PerlIO_funcs * tab;        /* Functions for this layer */
         IV             flags;      /* Various flags for state */
        };
</pre>
<p class="Pp">A <span class="Li">&quot;PerlIOl *&quot;</span> is a pointer to
    the struct, and the <i>application</i> level <span class="Li">&quot;PerlIO
    *&quot;</span> is a pointer to a <span class="Li">&quot;PerlIOl
    *&quot;</span> - i.e. a pointer to a pointer to the struct. This allows the
    application level <span class="Li">&quot;PerlIO *&quot;</span> to remain
    constant while the actual <span class="Li">&quot;PerlIOl *&quot;</span>
    underneath changes. (Compare perl's <span class="Li">&quot;SV *&quot;</span>
    which remains constant while its <span class="Li">&quot;sv_any&quot;</span>
    field changes as the scalar's type changes.) An IO stream is then in general
    represented as a pointer to this linked-list of &quot;layers&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">It should be noted that because of the double indirection in a
    <span class="Li">&quot;PerlIO *&quot;</span>, a
    <span class="Li">&quot;&amp;(perlio-&gt;next)&quot;</span> &quot;is&quot; a
    <span class="Li">&quot;PerlIO *&quot;</span>, and so to some degree at least
    one layer can use the &quot;standard&quot; API on the next layer down.</p>
<p class="Pp">A &quot;layer&quot; is composed of two parts:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>1.</dt>
  <dd>The functions and attributes of the &quot;layer class&quot;.</dd>
  <dt>2.</dt>
  <dd>The per-instance data for a particular handle.</dd>
</dl>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Functions_and_Attributes"><a class="permalink" href="#Functions_and_Attributes">Functions
  and Attributes</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The functions and attributes are accessed via the &quot;tab&quot;
    (for table) member of <span class="Li">&quot;PerlIOl&quot;</span>. The
    functions (methods of the layer &quot;class&quot;) are fixed, and are
    defined by the <span class="Li">&quot;PerlIO_funcs&quot;</span> type. They
    are broadly the same as the public
    <span class="Li">&quot;PerlIO_xxxxx&quot;</span> functions:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  struct _PerlIO_funcs

                        int fd, int imode, int perm,
                        PerlIO *old,
                        int narg, SV **args);

   void         (*Set_ptrcnt)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f,STDCHAR *ptr,SSize_t cnt);
  };
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The first few members of the struct give a function table size for
    compatibility check &quot;name&quot; for the layer, the size to
    <span class="Li">&quot;malloc&quot;</span> for the per-instance data, and
    some flags which are attributes of the class as whole (such as whether it is
    a buffering layer), then follow the functions which fall into four basic
    groups:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>1.</dt>
  <dd>Opening and setup functions</dd>
  <dt>2.</dt>
  <dd>Basic IO operations</dd>
  <dt>3.</dt>
  <dd>Stdio class buffering options.</dd>
  <dt>4.</dt>
  <dd>Functions to support Perl's traditional &quot;fast&quot; access to the
      buffer.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">A layer does not have to implement all the functions, but the
    whole table has to be present. Unimplemented slots can be NULL (which will
    result in an error when called) or can be filled in with stubs to
    &quot;inherit&quot; behaviour from a &quot;base class&quot;. This
    &quot;inheritance&quot; is fixed for all instances of the layer, but as the
    layer chooses which stubs to populate the table, limited &quot;multiple
    inheritance&quot; is possible.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Per-instance_Data"><a class="permalink" href="#Per-instance_Data">Per-instance
  Data</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The per-instance data are held in memory beyond the basic PerlIOl
    struct, by making a PerlIOl the first member of the layer's struct thus:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        typedef struct
        {
         struct _PerlIO base;       /* Base &quot;class&quot; info */
         STDCHAR *      buf;        /* Start of buffer */
         STDCHAR *      end;        /* End of valid part of buffer */
         STDCHAR *      ptr;        /* Current position in buffer */
         Off_t          posn;       /* Offset of buf into the file */
         Size_t         bufsiz;     /* Real size of buffer */
         IV             oneword;    /* Emergency buffer */
        } PerlIOBuf;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">In this way (as for perl's scalars) a pointer to a PerlIOBuf can
    be treated as a pointer to a PerlIOl.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Layers_in_action."><a class="permalink" href="#Layers_in_action.">Layers
  in action.</a></h2>
<pre>                table           perlio          unix
            |           |
            +-----------+    +----------+    +--------+

            |           |    +----------+
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The above attempts to show how the layer scheme works in a simple
    case. The application's <span class="Li">&quot;PerlIO *&quot;</span> points
    to an entry in the table(s) representing open (allocated) handles. For
    example the first three slots in the table correspond to
    <span class="Li">&quot;stdin&quot;</span>,<span class="Li">&quot;stdout&quot;</span>
    and <span class="Li">&quot;stderr&quot;</span>. The table in turn points to
    the current &quot;top&quot; layer for the handle - in this case an instance
    of the generic buffering layer &quot;perlio&quot;. That layer in turn points
    to the next layer down - in this case the low-level &quot;unix&quot;
  layer.</p>
<p class="Pp">The above is roughly equivalent to a &quot;stdio&quot; buffered
    stream, but with much more flexibility:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>If Unix level
      <span class="Li">&quot;read&quot;</span>/<span class="Li">&quot;write&quot;</span>/<span class="Li">&quot;lseek&quot;</span>
      is not appropriate for (say) sockets then the &quot;unix&quot; layer can
      be replaced (at open time or even dynamically) with a &quot;socket&quot;
      layer.</li>
  <li>Different handles can have different buffering schemes. The
      &quot;top&quot; layer could be the &quot;mmap&quot; layer if reading disk
      files was quicker using <span class="Li">&quot;mmap&quot;</span> than
      <span class="Li">&quot;read&quot;</span>. An &quot;unbuffered&quot; stream
      can be implemented simply by not having a buffer layer.</li>
  <li>Extra layers can be inserted to process the data as it flows through. This
      was the driving need for including the scheme in perl 5.7.0+ - we needed a
      mechanism to allow data to be translated between perl's internal encoding
      (conceptually at least Unicode as UTF-8), and the &quot;native&quot;
      format used by the system. This is provided by the
      &quot;:encoding(xxxx)&quot; layer which typically sits above the buffering
      layer.</li>
  <li>A layer can be added that does &quot;\n&quot; to CRLF translation. This
      layer can be used on any platform, not just those that normally do such
      things.</li>

    <p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;Open()&quot;</span> method has lots

        <span class="Li">&quot;open&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;PerlIO_open&quot;</span>, perl's
        <span class="Li">&quot;sysopen&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;PerlIO_fdopen&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;PerlIO_reopen&quot;</span>. The full prototype is
        as follows:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre> PerlIO *       (*Open)(pTHX_ PerlIO_funcs *tab,
                        PerlIO_list_t *layers, IV n,
                        const char *mode,
                        int fd, int imode, int perm,
                        PerlIO *old,
                        int narg, SV **args);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Open should (perhaps indirectly) call
        <span class="Li">&quot;PerlIO_allocate()&quot;</span> to allocate a slot
        in the table and associate it with the layers information for the opened
        file, by calling <span class="Li">&quot;PerlIO_push&quot;</span>. The
        <i>layers</i> is an array of all the layers destined for the
        <span class="Li">&quot;PerlIO *&quot;</span>, and any arguments passed
        to them, <i>n</i> is the index into that array of the layer being
        called. The macro <span class="Li">&quot;PerlIOArg&quot;</span> will
        return a (possibly <span class="Li">&quot;NULL&quot;</span>) SV * for
        the argument passed to the layer.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The <i>mode</i> string is an
        &quot;<span class="Li">&quot;fopen()&quot;</span>-like&quot; string
        which would match the regular expression
        <span class="Li">&quot;/^[I#]?[rwa]\+?[bt]?$/&quot;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">'I'</span> prefix is used during creation
        of
        <span class="Li">&quot;stdin&quot;</span>..<span class="Li">&quot;stderr&quot;</span>
        via special <span class="Li">&quot;PerlIO_fdopen&quot;</span> calls; the
        <span class="Li">'#'</span> prefix means that this is
        <span class="Li">&quot;sysopen&quot;</span> and that <i>imode</i> and
        <i>perm</i> should be passed to
        <span class="Li">&quot;PerlLIO_open3&quot;</span>;
        <span class="Li">'r'</span> means <b>r</b>ead,
        <span class="Li">'w'</span> means <b>w</b>rite and
        <span class="Li">'a'</span> means <b>a</b>ppend. The
        <span class="Li">'+'</span> suffix means that both reading and
        writing/appending are permitted. The <span class="Li">'b'</span> suffix
        means file should be binary, and <span class="Li">'t'</span> means it is
        text. (Almost all layers should do the IO in binary mode, and ignore the
        b/t bits. The <span class="Li">&quot;:crlf&quot;</span> layer should be
        pushed to handle the distinction.)</p>
    <p class="Pp">If <i>old</i> is not <span class="Li">&quot;NULL&quot;</span>
        then this is a <span class="Li">&quot;PerlIO_reopen&quot;</span>. Perl
        itself does not use this (yet?) and semantics are a little vague.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If <i>fd</i> not negative then it is the numeric file
        descriptor <i>fd</i>, which will be open in a manner compatible with the
        supplied mode string, the call is thus equivalent to
        <span class="Li">&quot;PerlIO_fdopen&quot;</span>. In this case
        <i>nargs</i> will be zero.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If <i>nargs</i> is greater than zero then it gives the number
        of arguments passed to <span class="Li">&quot;open&quot;</span>,
        otherwise it will be 1 if for example
        <span class="Li">&quot;PerlIO_open&quot;</span> was called. In simple
        cases SvPV_nolen(*args) is the pathname to open.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If a layer provides <span class="Li">&quot;Open()&quot;</span>
        it should normally call the <span class="Li">&quot;Open()&quot;</span>
        method of next layer down (if any) and then push itself on top if that
        succeeds. <span class="Li">&quot;PerlIOBase_open&quot;</span> is
        provided to do exactly that, so in most cases you don't have to write
        your own <span class="Li">&quot;Open()&quot;</span> method. If this
        method is not defined, other layers may have difficulty pushing
        themselves on top of it during open.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If <span class="Li">&quot;PerlIO_push&quot;</span> was
        performed and open has failed, it must
        <span class="Li">&quot;PerlIO_pop&quot;</span> itself, since if it's
        not, the layer won't be removed and may cause bad problems.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Core_Layers"><a class="permalink" href="#Core_Layers">Core
  Layers</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The file <span class="Li">&quot;perlio.c&quot;</span> provides the
    following layers:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>&quot;unix&quot;</dt>
  <dd>A basic non-buffered layer which calls Unix/POSIX
      <span class="Li">&quot;read()&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;write()&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;lseek()&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;close()&quot;</span>. No buffering. Even on
      platforms that distinguish between O_TEXT and O_BINARY this layer is
      always O_BINARY.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;perlio&quot;</dt>
  <dd>A very complete generic buffering layer which provides the whole of PerlIO
      API. It is also intended to be used as a &quot;base class&quot; for other
      layers. (For example its <span class="Li">&quot;Read()&quot;</span> method
      is implemented in terms of the
      <span class="Li">&quot;Get_cnt()&quot;</span>/<span class="Li">&quot;Get_ptr()&quot;</span>/<span class="Li">&quot;Set_ptrcnt()&quot;</span>
      methods).
    <p class="Pp">&quot;perlio&quot; over &quot;unix&quot; provides a complete
        replacement for stdio as seen via PerlIO API. This is the default for
        USE_PERLIO when system's stdio does not permit perl's &quot;fast
        gets&quot; access, and which do not distinguish between
        <span class="Li">&quot;O_TEXT&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;O_BINARY&quot;</span>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>&quot;stdio&quot;</dt>
  <dd>A layer which provides the PerlIO API via the layer scheme, but implements
      it by calling system's stdio. This is (currently) the default if system's
      stdio provides sufficient access to allow perl's &quot;fast gets&quot;
      access and which do not distinguish between
      <span class="Li">&quot;O_TEXT&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;O_BINARY&quot;</span>.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;crlf&quot;</dt>
  <dd>A layer derived using &quot;perlio&quot; as a base class. It provides
      Win32-like &quot;\n&quot; to CR,LF translation. Can either be applied
      above &quot;perlio&quot; or serve as the buffer layer itself.
      &quot;crlf&quot; over &quot;unix&quot; is the default if system
      distinguishes between <span class="Li">&quot;O_TEXT&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;O_BINARY&quot;</span> opens. (At some point
      &quot;unix&quot; will be replaced by a &quot;native&quot; Win32 IO layer
      on that platform, as Win32's read/write layer has various drawbacks.) The
      &quot;crlf&quot; layer is a reasonable model for a layer which transforms
      data in some way.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;mmap&quot;</dt>
  <dd>If Configure detects <span class="Li">&quot;mmap()&quot;</span> functions
      this layer is provided (with &quot;perlio&quot; as a &quot;base&quot;)
      which does &quot;read&quot; operations by <i>mmap()</i>ing the file.
      Performance improvement is marginal on modern systems, so it is mainly
      there as a proof of concept. It is likely to be unbundled from the core at
      some point. The &quot;mmap&quot; layer is a reasonable model for a
      minimalist &quot;derived&quot; layer.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;pending&quot;</dt>
  <dd>An &quot;internal&quot; derivative of &quot;perlio&quot; which can be used
      to provide <i>Unread()</i> function for layers which have no buffer or
      cannot be bothered. (Basically this layer's
      <span class="Li">&quot;Fill()&quot;</span> pops itself off the stack and
      so resumes reading from layer below.)</dd>
  <dt>&quot;raw&quot;</dt>
  <dd>A dummy layer which never exists on the layer stack. Instead when
      &quot;pushed&quot; it actually pops the stack removing itself, it then
      calls Binmode function table entry on all the layers in the stack -
      normally this (via PerlIOBase_binmode) removes any layers which do not
      have <span class="Li">&quot;PERLIO_K_RAW&quot;</span> bit set. Layers can
      modify that behaviour by defining their own Binmode entry.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;utf8&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Another dummy layer. When pushed it pops itself and sets the
      <span class="Li">&quot;PERLIO_F_UTF8&quot;</span> flag on the layer which
      was (and now is once more) the top of the stack.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">In addition <i>perlio.c</i> also provides a number of
    <span class="Li">&quot;PerlIOBase_xxxx()&quot;</span> functions which are
    intended to be used in the table slots of classes which do not need to do
    anything special for a particular method.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Extension_Layers"><a class="permalink" href="#Extension_Layers">Extension
  Layers</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Layers can be made available by extension modules. When an unknown
    layer is encountered the PerlIO code will perform the equivalent of :</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>   use PerlIO 'layer';
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Where <i>layer</i> is the unknown layer. <i>PerlIO.pm</i> will
    then attempt to:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>   require PerlIO::layer;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If after that process the layer is still not defined then the
    <span class="Li">&quot;open&quot;</span> will fail.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following extension layers are bundled with perl:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>&quot;:encoding&quot;</dt>
  <dd>
    <pre>   use Encoding;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">makes this layer available, although <i>PerlIO.pm</i>
        &quot;knows&quot; where to find it. It is an example of a layer which
        takes an argument as it is called thus:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>   open( $fh, &quot;&lt;:encoding(iso-8859-7)&quot;, $pathname );
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>&quot;:scalar&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Provides support for reading data from and writing data to a scalar.
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>   open( $fh, &quot;+&lt;:scalar&quot;, \$scalar );
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">When a handle is so opened, then reads get bytes from the
        string value of <i></i><span class="Li"><i>$scalar</i></span><i></i>,
        and writes change the value. In both cases the position in
        <i></i><span class="Li"><i>$scalar</i></span><i></i> starts as zero but
        can be altered via <span class="Li">&quot;seek&quot;</span>, and
        determined via <span class="Li">&quot;tell&quot;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Please note that this layer is implied when calling
        <i>open()</i> thus:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>   open( $fh, &quot;+&lt;&quot;, \$scalar );
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>&quot;:via&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Provided to allow layers to be implemented as Perl code. For instance:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>   use PerlIO::via::StripHTML;
   open( my $fh, &quot;&lt;:via(StripHTML)&quot;, &quot;index.html&quot; );

<h1 class="Sh" id="TODO"><a class="permalink" href="#TODO">TODO</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Things that need to be done to improve this document.</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Explain how to make a valid fh without going through <i>open()</i>(i.e.
      apply a layer). For example if the file is not opened through perl, but we
      want to get back a fh, like it was opened by Perl.
    <p class="Pp">How PerlIO_apply_layera fits in, where its docs, was it made
        public?</p>
    <p class="Pp">Currently the example could be something like this:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>  PerlIO *foo_to_PerlIO(pTHX_ char *mode, ...)
  {
      char *mode; /* &quot;w&quot;, &quot;r&quot;, etc */
      const char *layers = &quot;:APR&quot;; /* the layer name */
      PerlIO *f = PerlIO_allocate(aTHX);
      if (!f) {
          return NULL;
      }
      PerlIO_apply_layers(aTHX_ f, mode, layers);
      if (f) {
          PerlIOAPR *st = PerlIOSelf(f, PerlIOAPR);
          /* fill in the st struct, as in _open() */
          st-&gt;file = file;
          PerlIOBase(f)-&gt;flags |= PERLIO_F_OPEN;
          return f;
      }
      return NULL;
  }
    </pre>
  </li>
  <li>fix/add the documentation in places marked as XXX.</li>
  <li>The handling of errors by the layer is not specified. e.g. when $! should
      be set explicitly, when the error handling should be just delegated to the
      top layer.
    <p class="Pp">Probably give some hints on using <i>SETERRNO()</i> or
        pointers to where they can be found.</p>
  </li>
  <li>I think it would help to give some concrete examples to make it easier to
      understand the API. Of course I agree that the API has to be concise, but
      since there is no second document that is more of a guide, I think that
      it'd make it easier to start with the doc which is an API, but has
      examples in it in places where things are unclear, to a person who is not
      a PerlIO guru (yet).</li>
