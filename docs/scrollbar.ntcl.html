   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

[<span class="Op"><b>-activerelief</b> <i>activeRelief</i>]</span> Specifies the
  relief to use when displaying the element that is active, if any. Elements
  other than the active element are always displayed with a raised relief.
  [<span class="Op"><b>-command</b> <i>command</i>]</span> Specifies the prefix
  of a Tcl command to invoke to change the view in the widget associated with
  the scrollbar. When a user requests a view change by manipulating the
  scrollbar, a Tcl command is invoked. The actual command consists of this
  option followed by additional information as described later. This option
  almost always has a value such as <b>.t xview</b> or <b>.t yview</b>,
  consisting of the name of a widget and either <b>xview</b> (if the scrollbar
  is for horizontal scrolling) or <b>yview</b> (for vertical scrolling). All
  scrollable widgets have <b>xview</b> and <b>yview</b> commands that take
  exactly the additional arguments appended by the scrollbar as described in
  <b>SCROLLING COMMANDS</b> below. [<span class="Op"><b>-elementborderwidth</b>
  <i>elementBorderWidth</i>]</span> Specifies the width of borders drawn around
  the internal elements of the scrollbar (the two arrows and the slider). The
  value may have any of the forms acceptable to <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>. If this
  value is less than zero, the value of the <b>borderWidth</b> option is used in
  its place. [<span class="Op"><b>-width</b> <i>width</i>]</span> Specifies the
  desired narrow dimension of the scrollbar window, not including 3-D border, if
  any. For vertical scrollbars this will be the width and for horizontal
  scrollbars this will be the height. The value may have any of the forms
  acceptable to <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>.

The <b>scrollbar</b> command creates a new window (given by the <i>pathName</i>
  argument) and makes it into a scrollbar widget. Additional options, described
  above, may be specified on the command line or in the option database to
  configure aspects of the scrollbar such as its colors, orientation, and
  relief. The <b>scrollbar</b> command returns its <i>pathName</i> argument. At
  the time this command is invoked, there must not exist a window named
  <i>pathName</i>, but <i>pathName</i>'s parent must exist.
<p class="Pp">A scrollbar is a widget that displays two arrows, one at each end
    of the scrollbar, and a <i>slider</i> in the middle portion of the
    scrollbar. It provides information about what is visible in an <i>associated
    window</i> that displays a document of some sort (such as a file being
    edited or a drawing). The position and size of the slider indicate which
    portion of the document is visible in the associated window. For example, if
    the slider in a vertical scrollbar covers the top third of the area between
    the two arrows, it means that the associated window displays the top third
    of its document.</p>
<p class="Pp">Scrollbars can be used to adjust the view in the associated window
    by clicking or dragging with the mouse. See the <b>BINDINGS</b> section
    below for details.</p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="ELEMENTS"><a class="permalink" href="#ELEMENTS">ELEMENTS</a></h1>
A scrollbar displays five elements, which are referred to in the widget commands
  for the scrollbar:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>arrow1</b></dt>
  <dd>The top or left arrow in the scrollbar.</dd>
  <dt><b>trough1</b></dt>
  <dd>The region between the slider and <b>arrow1</b>.</dd>
  <dt><b>slider</b></dt>
  <dd>The rectangle that indicates what is visible in the associated
    widget.</dd>
  <dt><b>trough2</b></dt>
  <dd>The region between the slider and <b>arrow2</b>.</dd>
  <dt><b>arrow2</b></dt>
  <dd>The bottom or right arrow in the scrollbar.</dd>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="WIDGET_COMMAND"><a class="permalink" href="#WIDGET_COMMAND">WIDGET
  COMMAND</a></h1>
The <b>scrollbar</b> command creates a new Tcl command whose name is
  <i>pathName</i>. This command may be used to invoke various operations on the
  widget. It has the following general form:
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<i>pathName option </i>?<i>arg arg ...</i>?
</pre>
</div>
<i>Option</i> and the <i>arg</i>s determine the exact behavior of the command.
  The following commands are possible for scrollbar widgets:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><i>pathName </i><b>activate </b>?<i>element</i>?</dt>
  <dd>Marks the element indicated by <i>element</i> as active, which causes it
      to be displayed as specified by the <b>activeBackground</b> and
      <b>activeRelief</b> options. The only element values understood by this
      command are <b>arrow1</b>, <b>slider</b>, or <b>arrow2</b>. If any other
      value is specified then no element of the scrollbar will be active. If
      <i>element</i> is not specified, the command returns the name of the
      element that is currently active, or an empty string if no element is
      active.</dd>
  <dt><i>pathName </i><b>cget</b> <i>option</i></dt>
  <dd>Returns the current value of the configuration option given by
      <i>option</i>. <i>Option</i> may have any of the values accepted by the
      <b>scrollbar</b> command.</dd>
  <dt><i>pathName </i><b>configure</b> ?<i>option</i>? ?<i>value option value
    ...</i>?</dt>
  <dd>Query or modify the configuration options of the widget. If no
      <i>option</i> is specified, returns a list describing all of the available
      options for <i>pathName</i> (see <b>Tk_ConfigureInfo</b> for information
      on the format of this list). If <i>option</i> is specified with no
      <i>value</i>, then the command returns a list describing the one named
      option (this list will be identical to the corresponding sublist of the
      value returned if no <i>option</i> is specified). If one or more
      <i>option-value</i> pairs are specified, then the command modifies the
      given widget option(s) to have the given value(s); in this case the
      command returns an empty string. <i>Option</i> may have any of the values
      accepted by the <b>scrollbar</b> command.</dd>
  <dt><i>pathName </i><b>delta </b><i>deltaX deltaY</i></dt>
  <dd>Returns a real number indicating the fractional change in the scrollbar
      setting that corresponds to a given change in slider position. For
      example, if the scrollbar is horizontal, the result indicates how much the
      scrollbar setting must change to move the slider <i>deltaX</i> pixels to
      the right (<i>deltaY</i> is ignored in this case). If the scrollbar is
      vertical, the result indicates how much the scrollbar setting must change
      to move the slider <i>deltaY</i> pixels down. The arguments and the result
      may be zero or negative.</dd>
  <dt><i>pathName </i><b>fraction </b><i>x y</i></dt>
  <dd>Returns a real number between 0 and 1 indicating where the point given by
      <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> lies in the trough area of the scrollbar. The value
      0 corresponds to the top or left of the trough, the value 1 corresponds to
      the bottom or right, 0.5 corresponds to the middle, and so on. <i>X</i>
      and <i>y</i> must be pixel coordinates relative to the scrollbar widget.
      If <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> refer to a point outside the trough, the closest
      point in the trough is used.</dd>
  <dt><i>pathName </i><b>get</b></dt>
  <dd>Returns the scrollbar settings in the form of a list whose elements are
      the arguments to the most recent <b>set</b> widget command.</dd>
  <dt><i>pathName </i><b>identify</b> <i>x y</i></dt>
  <dd>Returns the name of the element under the point given by <i>x</i> and
      <i>y</i> (such as <b>arrow1</b>), or an empty string if the point does not
      lie in any element of the scrollbar. <i>X</i> and <i>y</i> must be pixel
      coordinates relative to the scrollbar widget.</dd>
  <dt><i>pathName </i><b>set</b> <i>first last</i></dt>
  <dd>This command is invoked by the scrollbar's associated widget to tell the
      scrollbar about the current view in the widget. The command takes two
      arguments, each of which is a real fraction between 0 and 1. The fractions
      describe the range of the document that is visible in the associated
      widget. For example, if <i>first</i> is 0.2 and <i>last</i> is 0.4, it
      means that the first part of the document visible in the window is 20% of
      the way through the document, and the last visible part is 40% of the way
      through.</dd>

<h1 class="Sh" id="SCROLLING_COMMANDS"><a class="permalink" href="#SCROLLING_COMMANDS">SCROLLING
  COMMANDS</a></h1>
When the user interacts with the scrollbar, for example by dragging the slider,
  the scrollbar notifies the associated widget that it must change its view. The
  scrollbar makes the notification by evaluating a Tcl command generated from
  the scrollbar's <b>-command</b> option. The command may take any of the
  following forms. In each case, <i>prefix</i> is the contents of the
  <b>-command</b> option, which usually has a form like <b>.t yview</b>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><i>prefix </i><b>moveto </b><i>fraction</i></dt>
  <dd><i>Fraction</i> is a real number between 0 and 1. The widget should adjust
      its view so that the point given by <i>fraction</i> appears at the
      beginning of the widget. If <i>fraction</i> is 0 it refers to the
      beginning of the document. 1.0 refers to the end of the document, 0.333
      refers to a point one-third of the way through the document, and so
    on.</dd>
  <dt><i>prefix </i><b>scroll </b><i>number </i><b>units</b></dt>
  <dd>The widget should adjust its view by <i>number</i> units. The units are
      defined in whatever way makes sense for the widget, such as characters or
      lines in a text widget. <i>Number</i> is either 1, which means one unit
      should scroll off the top or left of the window, or -1, which means that
      one unit should scroll off the bottom or right of the window.</dd>
  <dt><i>prefix </i><b>scroll </b><i>number </i><b>pages</b></dt>
  <dd>The widget should adjust its view by <i>number</i> pages. It is up to the
      widget to define the meaning of a page; typically it is slightly less than
      what fits in the window, so that there is a slight overlap between the old
      and new views. <i>Number</i> is either 1, which means the next page should
      become visible, or -1, which means that the previous page should become
      visible.</dd>

<h1 class="Sh" id="OLD_COMMAND_SYNTAX"><a class="permalink" href="#OLD_COMMAND_SYNTAX">OLD
  COMMAND SYNTAX</a></h1>
In versions of Tk before 4.0, the <b>set</b> and <b>get</b> widget commands used
  a different form. This form is still supported for backward compatibility, but
  it is deprecated. In the old command syntax, the <b>set</b> widget command has
  the following form:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><i>pathName </i><b>set</b> <i>totalUnits windowUnits firstUnit
    lastUnit</i></dt>
  <dd>In this form the arguments are all integers. <i>TotalUnits</i> gives the
      total size of the object being displayed in the associated widget. The
      meaning of one unit depends on the associated widget; for example, in a
      text editor widget units might correspond to lines of text.
      <i>WindowUnits</i> indicates the total number of units that can fit in the
      associated window at one time. <i>FirstUnit</i> and <i>lastUnit</i> give
      the indices of the first and last units currently visible in the
      associated window (zero corresponds to the first unit of the object).</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Under the old syntax the <b>get</b> widget command returns a list
    of four integers, consisting of the <i>totalUnits</i>, <i>windowUnits</i>,
    <i>firstUnit</i>, and <i>lastUnit</i> values from the last <b>set</b> widget
    command.</p>
<p class="Pp">The commands generated by scrollbars also have a different form
    when the old syntax is being used:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><i>prefix</i> <i>unit</i></dt>
  <dd><i>Unit</i> is an integer that indicates what should appear at the top or
      left of the associated widget's window. It has the same meaning as the
      <i>firstUnit</i> and <i>lastUnit</i> arguments to the <b>set</b> widget
      command.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The most recent <b>set</b> widget command determines whether or
    not to use the old syntax. If it is given two real arguments then the new
    syntax will be used in the future, and if it is given four integer arguments
    then the old syntax will be used.</p>

Tk automatically creates class bindings for scrollbars that give them the
  following default behavior. If the behavior is different for vertical and
  horizontal scrollbars, the horizontal behavior is described in parentheses.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
