   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

The <b>clock</b> command performs several operations that obtain and manipulate
  values that represent times. The command supports several subcommands that
  determine what action is carried out by the command.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>clock add</b> <i>timeVal</i> ?<i>count unit...</i>? ?<i>-option

  <dt><b>clock clicks</b> ?<i>-option</i>?</dt>
  <dd>If no <i>-option</i> argument is supplied, returns a high-resolution time
      value as a system-dependent integer value. The unit of the value is
      system-dependent but should be the highest resolution clock available on

The <b>clock add</b> command performs clock arithmetic on a value (expressed as
  nominal seconds from the epoch time of 1 January 1970, 00:00 UTC) given as its
  first argument. The remaining arguments (other than the possible
  <b>-timezone</b>, <b>-locale</b> and <b>-gmt</b> options) are integers and
  keywords in alternation, where the keywords are chosen from <b>seconds</b>,
  <b>minutes</b>, <b>hours</b>, <b>days</b>, <b>weeks</b>, <b>months</b>, or
  <b>years</b>, or any unique prefix of such a word.
<p class="Pp">Addition of seconds, minutes and hours is fairly straightforward;
    the given time increment (times sixty for minutes, or 3600 for hours) is
    simply added to the <i>timeVal</i> given to the <b>clock add</b> command.
    The result is interpreted as a nominal number of seconds from the Epoch.</p>
<p class="Pp">Surprising results may be obtained when crossing a point at which
    a leap second is inserted or removed; the <b>clock add</b> command simply
    ignores leap seconds and therefore assumes that times come in sequence,
    23:59:58, 23:59:59, 00:00:00. (This assumption is handled by the fact that
    Tcl's model of time reacts to leap seconds by speeding or slowing the clock
    by a minuscule amount until Tcl's time is back in step with the world.</p>
<p class="Pp">The fact that adding and subtracting hours is defined in terms of
    absolute time means that it will add fixed amounts of time in time zones
    that observe summer time (Daylight Saving Time). For example, the following
    code sets the value of <b>x</b> to <b>04:00:00</b> because the clock has
    changed in the interval in question.</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
set s [<b>clock scan</b> {2004-10-30 05:00:00} \
           -format {%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S} \
           -timezone :America/New_York]
set a [<b>clock add</b> $s 24 hours -timezone :America/New_York]
set x [<b>clock format</b> $a \
           -format {%H:%M:%S} -timezone :America/New_York]
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Adding and subtracting days and weeks is accomplished by
    converting the given time to a calendar day and time of day in the
    appropriate time zone and locale. The requisite number of days (weeks are
    converted to days by multiplying by seven) is added to the calendar day, and
    the date and time are then converted back to a count of seconds from the
    epoch time.</p>
<p class="Pp">Adding and subtracting a given number of days across the point
    that the time changes at the start or end of summer time (Daylight Saving
    Time) results in the <i>same local time</i> on the day in question. For
    instance, the following code sets the value of <b>x</b> to
  <b>05:00:00</b>.</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
set s [<b>clock scan</b> {2004-10-30 05:00:00} \
           -format {%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S} \
           -timezone :America/New_York]
set a [<b>clock add</b> $s 1 day -timezone :America/New_York]
set x [<b>clock format</b> $a \
           -format {%H:%M:%S} -timezone :America/New_York]
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">In cases of ambiguity, where the same local time happens twice on
    the same day, the earlier time is used. In cases where the conversion yields
    an impossible time (for instance, 02:30 during the Spring Daylight Saving
    Time change using US rules), the time is converted as if the clock had not
    changed. Thus, the following code will set the value of <b>x</b> to
    <b>03:30:00</b>.</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
set s [<b>clock scan</b> {2004-04-03 02:30:00} \
           -format {%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S} \
           -timezone :America/New_York]
set a [<b>clock add</b> $s 1 day -timezone :America/New_York]
set x [<b>clock format</b> $a \
           -format {%H:%M:%S} -timezone :America/New_York]
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Adding a given number of days or weeks works correctly across the
    conversion between the Julian and Gregorian calendars; the omitted days are
    skipped. The following code sets <b>z</b> to <b>1752-09-14</b>.</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
set x [<b>clock scan</b> 1752-09-02 -format %Y-%m-%d -locale en_US]
set y [<b>clock add</b> $x 1 day -locale en_US]
set z [<b>clock format</b> $y -format %Y-%m-%d -locale en_US]
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">In the bizarre case that adding the given number of days yields a
    date that does not exist because it falls within the dropped days of the
    Julian-to-Gregorian conversion, the date is converted as if it was on the
    Julian calendar.</p>
<p class="Pp">Adding a number of months, or a number of years, is similar; it
    converts the given time to a calendar date and time of day. It then adds the
    requisite number of months or years, and reconverts the resulting date and
    time of day to an absolute time.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the resulting date is impossible because the month has too few
    days (for example, when adding 1 month to 31 January), the last day of the
    month is substituted. Thus, adding 1 month to 31 January will result in 28
    February in a common year or 29 February in a leap year.</p>
<p class="Pp">The rules for handling anomalies relating to summer time and to
    the Gregorian calendar are the same when adding/subtracting months and years
    as they are when adding/subtracting days and weeks.</p>
<p class="Pp">If multiple <i>count unit</i> pairs are present on the command,
    they are evaluated consecutively, from left to right.</p>

Most of the subcommands supported by the <b>clock</b> command deal with times
  represented as a count of seconds from the epoch time, and this is the
  representation that <b>clock seconds</b> returns. There are three exceptions,
  which are all intended for use where higher-resolution times are required.
  <b>clock milliseconds</b> returns the count of milliseconds from the epoch
  time, and <b>clock microseconds</b> returns the count of microseconds from the
  epoch time. In addition, there is a <b>clock clicks</b> command that returns a
  platform-dependent high-resolution timer. Unlike <b>clock seconds</b> and
  <b>clock milliseconds</b>, the value of <b>clock clicks</b> is not guaranteed
  to be tied to any fixed epoch; it is simply intended to be the most precise
  interval timer available, and is intended only for relative timing studies
  such as benchmarks.

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="FORMATTING_TIMES"><a class="permalink" href="#FORMATTING_TIMES">FORMATTING

The <b>clock format</b> command produces times for display to a user or writing
  to an external medium. The command accepts times that are expressed in seconds
  from the epoch time of 1 January 1970, 00:00 UTC, as returned by <b>clock
  seconds</b>, <b>clock scan</b>, <b>clock add</b>, <b>file atime</b> or <b>file

    consists of any number of characters other than the per-cent sign
    (&#x201C;<b>%</b>&#x201D;) interspersed with any number of <i>format
    groups</i>, which are two-character sequences beginning with the per-cent
    sign. The permissible format groups, and their interpretation, are described

<p class="Pp">If a <b>-timezone</b> option is present, the following argument is

<p class="Pp">If a <b>-locale</b> option is present, the following argument is a
    string that specifies the locale in which the time is to be formatted, in
    the same format that is used for the <b>msgcat</b> package. Note that the
    default, if <b>-locale</b> is not specified, is the root locale <b>{}</b>
    rather than the current locale. The current locale may be obtained by using
    <b>-locale</b> <b>current</b>. In addition, some platforms support a
    <b>system</b> locale that reflects the user's current choices. For instance,
    on Windows, the format that the user has selected from dates and times in
    the Control Panel can be obtained by using the <b>system</b> locale. On
    platforms that do not define a user selection of date and time formats
    separate from <b>LC_TIME</b>, <b>-locale</b> <b>system</b> is synonymous

<h1 class="Sh" id="SCANNING_TIMES"><a class="permalink" href="#SCANNING_TIMES">SCANNING

The <b>clock scan</b> command accepts times that are formatted as strings and
  converts them to counts of seconds from the epoch time of 1 January 1970,
  00:00 UTC. It normally takes a <b>-format</b> option that is followed by a
  string describing the expected format of the input. (See <b>FREE FORM SCAN</b>
  for the effect of <b>clock scan</b> without such an argument.) The string
  consists of any number of characters other than the per-cent sign
  (&#x201C;<b>%</b>&#x201D;), interspersed with any number of <i>format
  groups</i>, which are two-character sequences beginning with the per-cent
  sign. The permissible format groups, and their interpretation, are described
  under <b>FORMAT GROUPS</b>.
<p class="Pp">If a <b>-timezone</b> option is present, the following argument is
    a string that specifies the time zone in which the date and time are to be
    interpreted. As an alternative to <b>-timezone</b> <i>:UTC</i>, the obsolete
    usage <b>-gmt</b> <i>true</i> may be used. See <b>TIME ZONES</b> for the

<p class="Pp">If a <b>-base</b> option is present, the following argument is a
    time (expressed in seconds from the epoch time) that is used as a <i>base
    time</i> for interpreting relative times. If no <b>-base</b> option is
    present, the base time is the current time.</p>
<p class="Pp">Scanning of times in fixed format works by determining three
    things: the date, the time of day, and the time zone. These three are then
    combined into a point in time, which is returned as the number of seconds
    from the epoch.</p>
<p class="Pp">Before scanning begins, the format string is preprocessed to
    replace <b>%c</b>, <b>%Ec</b>, <b>%x</b>, <b>%Ex</b>, <b>%X</b>. <b>%Ex</b>,
    <b>%r</b>, <b>%R</b>, <b>%T</b>, <b>%D</b>, <b>%EY</b> and <b>%+</b> format
    groups with counterparts that are appropriate to the current locale and
    contain none of the above groups. For instance, <b>%D</b> will (in the
    <b>en_US</b> locale) be replaced with <b>%m/%d/%Y</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The date is determined according to the fields that are present in
    the preprocessed format string. In order of preference:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>[1]</dt>
  <dd>If the string contains a <b>%s</b> format group, representing seconds from
      the epoch, that group is used to determine the date.</dd>
  <dt>[2]</dt>
  <dd>If the string contains a <b>%J</b> format group, representing the Julian
      Day Number, that group is used to determine the date.</dd>
  <dt>[3]</dt>
  <dd>If the string contains a complete set of format groups specifying century,
      year, month, and day of month; century, year, and day of year; or ISO8601
      fiscal year, week of year, and day of week; those groups are combined and
      used to determine the date. If more than one complete set is present, the
      one at the rightmost position in the string is used.</dd>
  <dt>[4]</dt>
  <dd>If the string lacks a century but contains a set of format groups
      specifying year of century, month and day of month; year of century and
      day of year; or two-digit ISO8601 fiscal year, week of year, and day of
      week; those groups are combined and used to determine the date. If more
      than one complete set is present, the one at the rightmost position in the
      string is used. The year is presumed to lie in the range 1938 to 2037
      inclusive.</dd>
  <dt>[5]</dt>
  <dd>If the string entirely lacks any specification for the year (or contains
      the year only on the locale's alternative calendar) and contains a set of
      format groups specifying month and day of month, day of year, or week of
      year and day of week, those groups are combined and used to determine the
      date. If more than one complete set is present, the one at the rightmost
      position in the string is used. The year is determined by interpreting the
      base time in the given time zone.</dd>
  <dt>[6]</dt>
  <dd>If the string contains none of the above sets, but has a day of the month
      or day of the week, the day of the month or day of the week are used to
      determine the date by interpreting the base time in the given time zone
      and returning the given day of the current week or month. (The week runs
      from Monday to Sunday, ISO8601-fashion.) If both day of month and day of
      week are present, the day of the month takes priority.</dd>
  <dt>[7]</dt>
  <dd>If none of the above rules results in a usable date, the date of the base
      time in the given time zone is used.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The time is also determined according to the fields that are
    present in the preprocessed format string. In order of preference:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>[1]</dt>
  <dd>If the string contains a <b>%s</b> format group, representing seconds from
      the epoch, that group determines the time of day.</dd>
  <dt>[2]</dt>
  <dd>If the string contains either an hour on the 24-hour clock or an hour on
      the 12-hour clock plus an AM/PM indicator, that hour determines the hour
      of the day. If the string further contains a group specifying the minute
      of the hour, that group combines with the hour. If the string further
      contains a group specifying the second of the minute, that group combines
      with the hour and minute.</dd>
  <dt>[3]</dt>
  <dd>If the string contains neither a <b>%s</b> format group nor a group
      specifying the hour of the day, then midnight (<b>00:00</b>, the start of
      the given date) is used. The time zone is determined by either the
      <b>-timezone</b> or <b>-gmt</b> options, or by using the current time
      zone.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">If a format string lacks a <b>%z</b> or <b>%Z</b> format group, it
    is possible for the time to be ambiguous because it appears twice in the
    same day, once without and once with Daylight Saving Time. If this situation
    occurs, the first occurrence of the time is chosen. (For this reason, it is
    wise to have the input string contain the time zone when converting local
    times. This caveat does not apply to UTC times.)</p>

      the localized representation is expected to use the Gregorian calendar. On
      input, matches whatever <b>%c</b> produces.</dd>
  <dt><b>%C</b></dt>
  <dd>On output, receives the number of the century in Indo-Arabic numerals. On
      input, matches one or two digits, possibly with leading whitespace, that

  <dd>On output, produces the number of the day of the month, as two decimal
      digits. On input, matches one or two digits, possibly with leading
      whitespace, that are expected to be the number of the day of the
    month.</dd>
  <dt><b>%D</b></dt>
  <dd>This format group is synonymous with <b>%m/%d/%Y</b>. It should be used
      only in exchanging data within the <b>en_US</b> locale, since other
      locales typically do not use this order for the fields of the date.</dd>
  <dt><b>%e</b></dt>
  <dd>On output, produces the number of the day of the month, as one or two
      decimal digits (with a leading blank for one-digit dates). On input,

      expected to be the number of the day of the month.</dd>
  <dt><b>%Ec</b></dt>
  <dd>On output, produces a locale-dependent representation of the date and time
      of day in the locale's alternative calendar. On input, matches whatever
      <b>%Ec</b> produces. The locale's alternative calendar need not be the
      Gregorian calendar.</dd>
  <dt><b>%EC</b></dt>
  <dd>On output, produces a locale-dependent name of an era in the locale's
      alternative calendar. On input, matches the name of the era or any unique
      prefix.</dd>
  <dt><b>%EE</b></dt>
  <dd>On output, produces the string <b>B.C.E.</b> or <b>C.E.</b>, or a string
      of the same meaning in the locale, to indicate whether <b>%Y</b> refers to
      years before or after Year 1 of the Common Era. On input, accepts the
      string <b>B.C.E.</b>, <b>B.C.</b>, <b>C.E.</b>, <b>A.D.</b>, or the
      abbreviation appropriate to the current locale, and uses it to fix whether
      <b>%Y</b> refers to years before or after Year 1 of the Common Era.</dd>
  <dt><b>%Ex</b></dt>
  <dd>On output, produces a locale-dependent representation of the date in the
      locale's alternative calendar. On input, matches whatever <b>%Ex</b>
      produces. The locale's alternative calendar need not be the Gregorian
      calendar.</dd>
  <dt><b>%EX</b></dt>
  <dd>On output, produces a locale-dependent representation of the time of day
      in the locale's alternative numerals. On input, matches whatever
      <b>%EX</b> produces.</dd>
  <dt><b>%Ey</b></dt>
  <dd>On output, produces a locale-dependent number of the year of the era in
      the locale's alternative calendar and numerals. On input, matches such a
      number.</dd>
  <dt><b>%EY</b></dt>
  <dd>On output, produces a representation of the year in the locale's
      alternative calendar and numerals. On input, matches what <b>%EY</b>
      produces. Often synonymous with <b>%EC%Ey</b>.</dd>
  <dt><b>%g</b></dt>
  <dd>On output, produces a two-digit year number suitable for use with the
      week-based ISO8601 calendar; that is, the year number corresponds to the
      week number produced by <b>%V</b>. On input, accepts such a two-digit year
      number, possibly with leading whitespace.</dd>
  <dt><b>%G</b></dt>
  <dd>On output, produces a four-digit year number suitable for use with the
      week-based ISO8601 calendar; that is, the year number corresponds to the
      week number produced by <b>%V</b>. On input, accepts such a four-digit
      year number, possibly with leading whitespace.</dd>

      (001-366). On input, accepts such a number.</dd>
  <dt><b>%J</b></dt>
  <dd>On output, produces a string of digits giving the Julian Day Number. On
      input, accepts a string of digits and interprets it as a Julian Day
      Number. The Julian Day Number is a count of the number of calendar days
      that have elapsed since 1 January, 4713 BCE of the proleptic Julian
      calendar. The epoch time of 1 January 1970 corresponds to Julian Day
      Number 2440588.</dd>
  <dt><b>%k</b></dt>
  <dd>On output, produces a one- or two-digit number giving the hour of the day
      (0-23) on a 24-hour clock. On input, accepts such a number.</dd>
  <dt><b>%l</b></dt>

  <dt><b>%N</b></dt>
  <dd>On output, produces the number of the month (1-12) with one or two digits,
      and a leading blank for one-digit dates. On input, accepts one or two
      digits, possibly with leading whitespace, and interprets them as the
      number of the month.</dd>
  <dt><b>%Od</b>, <b>%Oe</b>, <b>%OH</b>, <b>%OI</b>, <b>%Ok</b>, <b>%Ol</b>,
    <b>%Om</b>, <b>%OM</b>, <b>%OS</b>, <b>%Ou</b>, <b>%Ow</b>, <b>%Oy</b></dt>
  <dd>All of these format groups are synonymous with their counterparts without
      the &#x201C;<b>O</b>&#x201D;, except that the string is produced and
      parsed in the locale-dependent alternative numerals.</dd>
  <dt><b>%p</b></dt>
  <dd>On output, produces an indicator for the part of the day, <b>AM</b> or
      <b>PM</b>, appropriate to the given locale. If the script of the given
      locale supports multiple letterforms, lowercase is preferred. On input,
      matches the representation <b>AM</b> or <b>PM</b> in the given locale, in
      either case.</dd>
  <dt><b>%P</b></dt>
  <dd>On output, produces an indicator for the part of the day, <b>am</b> or
      <b>pm</b>, appropriate to the given locale. If the script of the given
      locale supports multiple letterforms, uppercase is preferred. On input,
      matches the representation <b>AM</b> or <b>PM</b> in the given locale, in
      either case.</dd>
  <dt><b>%Q</b></dt>
  <dd>This format group is reserved for internal use within the Tcl
    library.</dd>
  <dt><b>%r</b></dt>
  <dd>On output, produces a locale-dependent time of day representation on a
      12-hour clock. On input, accepts whatever <b>%r</b> produces.</dd>
  <dt><b>%R</b></dt>
  <dd>On output, produces a locale-dependent time of day representation on a
      24-hour clock. On input, accepts whatever <b>%R</b> produces.</dd>
  <dt><b>%s</b></dt>
  <dd>On output, simply formats the <i>timeVal</i> argument as a decimal integer
      and inserts it into the output string. On input, accepts a decimal integer
      and uses is as the time value without any further processing. Since
      <b>%s</b> uniquely determines a point in time, it overrides all other
      input formats.</dd>
  <dt><b>%S</b></dt>
  <dd>On output, produces a two-digit number of the second of the minute
      (00-59). On input, accepts two digits and uses them as the second of the
      minute.</dd>
  <dt><b>%t</b></dt>
  <dd>On output, produces a TAB character. On input, matches a TAB
    character.</dd>
  <dt><b>%T</b></dt>
  <dd>Synonymous with <b>%H:%M:%S</b>.</dd>
  <dt><b>%u</b></dt>
  <dd>On output, produces the number of the day of the week
      (<b>1</b>&#x2192;Monday, <b>7</b>&#x2192;Sunday). On input, accepts a
      single digit and interprets it as the day of the week. Sunday may be
      either <b>0</b> or <b>7</b>.</dd>
  <dt><b>%U</b></dt>
  <dd>On output, produces the ordinal number of the week of the year (00-53).
      The first Sunday of the year is the first day of week 01. On input accepts
      two digits which are otherwise ignored. This format group is never used in
      determining an input date. This interpretation of the week of the year was
      once common in US banking but is now largely obsolete. See <b>%V</b> for
      the ISO8601 week number.</dd>
  <dt><b>%V</b></dt>
  <dd>On output, produces the number of the ISO8601 week as a two digit number
      (01-53). Week 01 is the week containing January 4; or the first week of
      the year containing at least 4 days; or the week containing the first
      Thursday of the year (the three statements are equivalent). Each week
      begins on a Monday. On input, accepts the ISO8601 week number.</dd>
  <dt><b>%w</b></dt>
  <dd>On output, produces the ordinal number of the day of the week (Sunday==0;
      Saturday==6). On input, accepts a single digit and interprets it as the
      day of the week; Sunday may be represented as either 0 or 7. Note that
      <b>%w</b> is not the ISO8601 weekday number, which is produced and
      accepted by <b>%u</b>.</dd>
  <dt><b>%W</b></dt>
  <dd>On output, produces a week number (00-53) within the year; week 01 begins
      on the first Monday of the year. On input, accepts two digits, which are
      otherwise ignored. This format group is never used in determining an input
      date. It is not the ISO8601 week number; that week is produced and
      accepted by <b>%V</b>.</dd>
  <dt><b>%x</b></dt>
  <dd>On output, produces the date in a locale-dependent representation. On
      input, accepts whatever <b>%x</b> produces and is used to determine
      calendar date.</dd>
  <dt><b>%X</b></dt>
  <dd>On output, produces the time of day in a locale-dependent representation.
      On input, accepts whatever <b>%X</b> produces and is used to determine
      time of day.</dd>
  <dt><b>%y</b></dt>
  <dd>On output, produces the two-digit year of the century. On input, accepts
      two digits, and is used to determine calendar date. The date is presumed
      to lie between 1938 and 2037 inclusive. Note that <b>%y</b> does not yield
      a year appropriate for use with the ISO8601 week number <b>%V</b>;
      programs should use <b>%g</b> for that purpose.</dd>
  <dt><b>%Y</b></dt>
  <dd>On output, produces the four-digit calendar year. On input, accepts four
      digits and may be used to determine calendar date. Note that <b>%Y</b>
      does not yield a year appropriate for use with the ISO8601 week number
      <b>%V</b>; programs should use <b>%G</b> for that purpose.</dd>
  <dt><b>%z</b></dt>
  <dd>On output, produces the current time zone, expressed in hours and minutes
      east (+hhmm) or west (-hhmm) of Greenwich. On input, accepts a time zone
      specifier (see <b>TIME ZONES</b> below) that will be used to determine the
      time zone.</dd>
  <dt><b>%Z</b></dt>
  <dd>On output, produces the current time zone's name, possibly translated to
      the given locale. On input, accepts a time zone specifier (see <b>TIME
      ZONES</b> below) that will be used to determine the time zone. This option
      should, in general, be used on input only when parsing RFC822 dates. Other
      uses are fraught with ambiguity; for instance, the string <b>BST</b> may
      represent British Summer Time or Brazilian Standard Time. It is
      recommended that date/time strings for use by computers use numeric time
      zones instead.</dd>
  <dt><b>%%</b></dt>
  <dd>On output, produces a literal &#x201C;<b>%</b>&#x201D; character. On
      input, matches a literal &#x201C;<b>%</b>&#x201D; character.</dd>
  <dt><b>%+</b></dt>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>[1]</dt>
  <dd>A time zone specified inside a string being parsed and matched by a
      <b>%z</b> or <b>%Z</b> format group.</dd>
  <dt>[2]</dt>

If it is a string in the above list, it designates a known time zone, and is
  interpreted as such.
<p class="Pp">For time zones in case [1] that do not match any of the above
    strings, and always for cases [2]-[6], the following rules apply.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the time zone begins with a colon, it is one of a standardized
    list of names like <b>:America/New_York</b> that give the rules for various
    locales. A complete list of the location names is too lengthy to be listed
    here. On most Tcl installations, the definitions of the locations are to be
    found in named files in the directory
    &#x201C;<i>/no_backup/tools/lib/tcl8.5/clock/tzdata</i>&#x201D;. On some
    Unix systems, these files are omitted, and the definitions are instead

    &#x201C;<i>/usr/share/lib/zoneinfo</i>&#x201D; or
    &#x201C;<i>/usr/local/etc/zoneinfo</i>&#x201D;. As a special case, the name
    <b>:localtime</b> refers to the local time zone as defined by the C
  library.</p>
<p class="Pp">A time zone string consisting of a plus or minus sign followed by
    four or six decimal digits is interpreted as an offset in hours, minutes,
    and seconds (if six digits are present) from UTC. The plus sign denotes a
    sign east of Greenwich; the minus sign one west of Greenwich.</p>
<p class="Pp">A time zone string conforming to the Posix specification of the
    <b>TZ</b> environment variable will be recognized. The specification may be
    found at
    <i>http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/basedefs/xbd_chap08.html</i>.</p>

  FORM SCAN</a></h1>
If the <b>clock scan</b> command is invoked without a <b>-format</b> option,
  then it requests a <i>free-form scan.</i> <i></i> <i>This form of scan is
  deprecated.</i> The reason for the deprecation is that there are too many
  ambiguities. (Does the string &#x201C;2000&#x201D; represent a year, a time of
  day, or a quantity?) No set of rules for interpreting free-form dates and
  times has been found to give unsurprising results in all cases.
<p class="Pp">If free-form scan is used, only the <b>-base</b> and <b>-gmt</b>
    options are accepted. The <b>-timezone</b> and <b>-locale</b> options will
    result in an error if <b>-format</b> is not supplied.</p>
<p class="Pp">For the benefit of users who need to understand legacy code that
    uses free-form scan, the documentation for how free-form scan interprets a
    string is included here:</p>
<p class="Pp">If only a time is specified, the current date is assumed. If the
    <i>inputString</i> does not contain a time zone mnemonic, the local time
    zone is assumed, unless the <b>-gmt</b> argument is true, in which case the
    clock value is calculated assuming that the specified time is relative to
    Greenwich Mean Time. <b>-gmt</b>, if specified, affects only the computed
    time value; it does not impact the interpretation of <b>-base</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the <b>-base</b> flag is specified, the next argument should
    contain an integer clock value. Only the date in this value is used, not the
    time. This is useful for determining the time on a specific day or doing
    other date-relative conversions.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>inputString</i> argument consists of zero or more
    specifications of the following form:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><i>time</i></dt>
  <dd>A time of day, which is of the form: <b>hh?:mm?:ss?? ?meridian? ?zone?</b>
      or <b>hhmm ?meridian? ?zone?</b> If no meridian is specified, <b>hh</b> is
      interpreted on a 24-hour clock.</dd>
  <dt><i>date</i></dt>
  <dd>A specific month and day with optional year. The acceptable formats are
      &#x201C;<b>mm/dd</b>?<b>/yy</b>?&#x201D;, &#x201C;<b>monthname dd</b>?<b>,
      yy</b>?&#x201D;, &#x201C;<b>day, dd monthname </b>?<b>yy</b>?&#x201D;,
      &#x201C;<b>dd monthname yy</b>&#x201D;,
      &#x201C;?<b>CC</b>?<b>yymmdd</b>&#x201D;, and
      &#x201C;<b>dd-monthname-</b>?<b>CC</b>?<b>yy</b>&#x201D;. The default year
      is the current year. If the year is less than 100, we treat the years
      00-68 as 2000-2068 and the years 69-99 as 1969-1999. Not all platforms can
      represent the years 38-70, so an error may result if these years are
    used.</dd>
  <dt><i>ISO 8601 point-in-time</i></dt>
  <dd>An ISO 8601 point-in-time specification, such as
      &#x201C;<i>CCyymmdd</i><b>T</b><i>hhmmss</i>,&#x201D; where <b>T</b> is
      the literal &#x201C;T&#x201D;, &#x201C;<i>CCyymmdd hhmmss</i>&#x201D;, or
      &#x201C;<i>CCyymmdd</i><b>T</b><i>hh:mm:ss</i>&#x201D;. Note that only
      these three formats are accepted. The command does <i>not</i> accept the
      full range of point-in-time specifications specified in ISO8601. Other
      formats can be recognized by giving an explicit <i>-format</i> option to
      the <b>clock scan</b> command.</dd>
  <dt><i>relative time</i></dt>
  <dd>A specification relative to the current time. The format is <b>number</b>
      <b>unit</b>. Acceptable units are <b>year</b>, <b>fortnight</b>,
      <b>month</b>, <b>week</b>, <b>day</b>, <b>hour</b>, <b>minute</b> (or
      <b>min</b>), and <b>second</b> (or <b>sec</b>). The unit can be specified
      as a singular or plural, as in <b>3 weeks</b>. These modifiers may also be
      specified: <b>tomorrow</b>, <b>yesterday</b>, <b>today</b>, <b>now</b>,
      <b>last</b>, <b>this</b>, <b>next</b>, <b>ago</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The actual date is calculated according to the following
  steps.</p>
<p class="Pp">First, any absolute date and/or time is processed and converted.
    Using that time as the base, day-of-week specifications are added. Next,
    relative specifications are used. If a date or day is specified, and no
    absolute or relative time is given, midnight is used. Finally, a correction
    is applied so that the correct hour of the day is produced after allowing
    for daylight savings time differences and the correct date is given when
    going from the end of a long month to a short month.</p>
