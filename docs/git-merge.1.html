Incorporates changes from the named commits (since the time their histories
  diverged from the current branch) into the current branch. This command is
  used by <i>git pull</i> to incorporate changes from another repository and can
  be used by hand to merge changes from one branch into another.
<p class="Pp">Assume the following history exists and the current branch is
    &quot;<b>master</b>&quot;:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
          A---B---C topic
         /
    D---E---F---G master
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">Then &quot;<b>git merge topic</b>&quot; will replay the changes
    made on the <b>topic</b> branch since it diverged from <b>master</b> (i.e.,
    <b>E</b>) until its current commit (<b>C</b>) on top of <b>master</b>, and
    record the result in a new commit along with the names of the two parent
    commits and a log message from the user describing the changes.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
          A---B---C topic

<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">The second syntax (&quot;<b>git merge --abort</b>&quot;) can only
    be run after the merge has resulted in conflicts. <i>git merge --abort</i>
    will abort the merge process and try to reconstruct the pre-merge state.
    However, if there were uncommitted changes when the merge started (and
    especially if those changes were further modified after the merge was
    started), <i>git merge --abort</i> will in some cases be unable to
    reconstruct the original (pre-merge) changes. Therefore:</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Warning</b>: Running <i>git merge</i> with non-trivial
    uncommitted changes is discouraged: while possible, it may leave you in a
    state that is hard to back out of in the case of a conflict.</p>
<p class="Pp">The third syntax (&quot;<b>git merge --continue</b>&quot;) can
    only be run after the merge has resulted in conflicts.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
--commit, --no-commit
<div class="Bd-indent">Perform the merge and commit the result. This option can
  be used to override --no-commit.
<p class="Pp">With --no-commit perform the merge but pretend the merge failed
    and do not autocommit, to give the user a chance to inspect and further
    tweak the merge result before committing.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--edit, -e, --no-edit</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Invoke an editor before committing successful mechanical
  merge to further edit the auto-generated merge message, so that the user can
  explain and justify the merge. The <b>--no-edit</b> option can be used to
  accept the auto-generated message (this is generally discouraged). The
  <b>--edit</b> (or <b>-e</b>) option is still useful if you are giving a draft
  message with the <b>-m</b> option from the command line and want to edit it in
  the editor.
<p class="Pp">Older scripts may depend on the historical behaviour of not
    allowing the user to edit the merge log message. They will see an editor
    opened when they run <b>git merge</b>. To make it easier to adjust such
    scripts to the updated behaviour, the environment variable
    <b>GIT_MERGE_AUTOEDIT</b> can be set to <b>no</b> at the beginning of
  them.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--ff</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When the merge resolves as a fast-forward, only update
  the branch pointer, without creating a merge commit. This is the default
  behavior.</div>
<p class="Pp">--no-ff</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Create a merge commit even when the merge resolves as a
  fast-forward. This is the default behaviour when merging an annotated (and
  possibly signed) tag that is not stored in its natural place in
  <i>refs/tags/</i> hierarchy.</div>
<p class="Pp">--ff-only</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Refuse to merge and exit with a non-zero status unless
  the current <b>HEAD</b> is already up to date or the merge can be resolved as
  a fast-forward.</div>
<p class="Pp">-S[&lt;keyid&gt;], --gpg-sign[=&lt;keyid&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">GPG-sign the resulting merge commit. The <b>keyid</b>
  argument is optional and defaults to the committer identity; if specified, it
  must be stuck to the option without a space.</div>
<p class="Pp">--log[=&lt;n&gt;], --no-log</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">In addition to branch names, populate the log message
  with one-line descriptions from at most &lt;n&gt; actual commits that are
  being merged. See also <b>git-fmt-merge-msg</b>(1).
<p class="Pp">With --no-log do not list one-line descriptions from the actual
    commits being merged.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--signoff, --no-signoff</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Add Signed-off-by line by the committer at the end of the
  commit log message. The meaning of a signoff depends on the project, but it
  typically certifies that committer has the rights to submit this work under
  the same license and agrees to a Developer Certificate of Origin (see
  <b>http://developercertificate.org/</b> for more information).
<p class="Pp">With --no-signoff do not add a Signed-off-by line.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--stat, -n, --no-stat</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show a diffstat at the end of the merge. The diffstat is
  also controlled by the configuration option merge.stat.
<p class="Pp">With -n or --no-stat do not show a diffstat at the end of the
    merge.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--squash, --no-squash</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Produce the working tree and index state as if a real
  merge happened (except for the merge information), but do not actually make a
  commit, move the <b>HEAD</b>, or record <b>$GIT_DIR/MERGE_HEAD</b> (to cause
  the next <b>git commit</b> command to create a merge commit). This allows you
  to create a single commit on top of the current branch whose effect is the
  same as merging another branch (or more in case of an octopus).
<p class="Pp">With --no-squash perform the merge and commit the result. This
    option can be used to override --squash.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">-s &lt;strategy&gt;, --strategy=&lt;strategy&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Use the given merge strategy; can be supplied more than
  once to specify them in the order they should be tried. If there is no
  <b>-s</b> option, a built-in list of strategies is used instead (<i>git
  merge-recursive</i> when merging a single head, <i>git merge-octopus</i>
  otherwise).</div>
<p class="Pp">-X &lt;option&gt;, --strategy-option=&lt;option&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Pass merge strategy specific option through to the merge
  strategy.</div>
<p class="Pp">--verify-signatures, --no-verify-signatures</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Verify that the tip commit of the side branch being
  merged is signed with a valid key, i.e. a key that has a valid uid: in the
  default trust model, this means the signing key has been signed by a trusted
  key. If the tip commit of the side branch is not signed with a valid key, the
  merge is aborted.</div>
<p class="Pp">--summary, --no-summary</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Synonyms to --stat and --no-stat; these are deprecated
  and will be removed in the future.</div>
<p class="Pp">-q, --quiet</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Operate quietly. Implies --no-progress.</div>
<p class="Pp">-v, --verbose</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Be verbose.</div>
<p class="Pp">--progress, --no-progress</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Turn progress on/off explicitly. If neither is specified,
  progress is shown if standard error is connected to a terminal. Note that not
  all merge strategies may support progress reporting.</div>
<p class="Pp">--allow-unrelated-histories</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">By default, <b>git merge</b> command refuses to merge
  histories that do not share a common ancestor. This option can be used to
  override this safety when merging histories of two projects that started their
  lives independently. As that is a very rare occasion, no configuration
  variable to enable this by default exists and will not be added.</div>
<p class="Pp">-m &lt;msg&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Set the commit message to be used for the merge commit
  (in case one is created).
<p class="Pp">If <b>--log</b> is specified, a shortlog of the commits being
    merged will be appended to the specified message.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>git fmt-merge-msg</i> command can be used to give a good
    default for automated <i>git merge</i> invocations. The automated message
    can include the branch description.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">-F &lt;file&gt;, --file=&lt;file&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Read the commit message to be used for the merge commit
  (in case one is created).
<p class="Pp">If <b>--log</b> is specified, a shortlog of the commits being
    merged will be appended to the specified message.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--[no-]rerere-autoupdate</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Allow the rerere mechanism to update the index with the
  result of auto-conflict resolution if possible.</div>
<p class="Pp">--abort</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Abort the current conflict resolution process, and try to
  reconstruct the pre-merge state.
<p class="Pp">If there were uncommitted worktree changes present when the merge
    started, <i>git merge --abort</i> will in some cases be unable to
    reconstruct these changes. It is therefore recommended to always commit or
    stash your changes before running <i>git merge</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>git merge --abort</i> is equivalent to <i>git reset --merge</i>
    when <b>MERGE_HEAD</b> is present.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--continue</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">After a <i>git merge</i> stops due to conflicts you can
  conclude the merge by running <i>git merge --continue</i> (see &quot;HOW TO
  RESOLVE CONFLICTS&quot; section below).</div>
<p class="Pp">&lt;commit&gt;...</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Commits, usually other branch heads, to merge into our
  branch. Specifying more than one commit will create a merge with more than two
  parents (affectionately called an Octopus merge).
<p class="Pp">If no commit is given from the command line, merge the
    remote-tracking branches that the current branch is configured to use as its
    upstream. See also the configuration section of this manual page.</p>
<p class="Pp">When <b>FETCH_HEAD</b> (and no other commit) is specified, the
    branches recorded in the <b>.git/FETCH_HEAD</b> file by the previous
    invocation of <b>git fetch</b> for merging are merged to the current
  branch.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="PRE_-MERGE_CHECKS"><a class="permalink" href="#PRE_-MERGE_CHECKS">PRE-MERGE
  CHECKS</a></h1>
Before applying outside changes, you should get your own work in good shape and
  committed locally, so it will not be clobbered if there are conflicts. See
  also <b>git-stash</b>(1). <i>git pull</i> and <i>git merge</i> will stop
  without doing anything when local uncommitted changes overlap with files that
  <i>git pull</i>/<i>git merge</i> may need to update.
<p class="Pp">To avoid recording unrelated changes in the merge commit, <i>git
    pull</i> and <i>git merge</i> will also abort if there are any changes
    registered in the index relative to the <b>HEAD</b> commit. (Special narrow
    exceptions to this rule may exist depending on which merge strategy is in
    use, but generally, the index must match HEAD.)</p>
<p class="Pp">If all named commits are already ancestors of <b>HEAD</b>, <i>git
    merge</i> will exit early with the message &quot;Already up to
  date.&quot;</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="FAST_-FORWARD_MERGE"><a class="permalink" href="#FAST_-FORWARD_MERGE">FAST-FORWARD
  MERGE</a></h1>
Often the current branch head is an ancestor of the named commit. This is the
  most common case especially when invoked from <i>git pull</i>: you are
  tracking an upstream repository, you have committed no local changes, and now
  you want to update to a newer upstream revision. In this case, a new commit is
  not needed to store the combined history; instead, the <b>HEAD</b> (along with
  the index) is updated to point at the named commit, without creating an extra
  merge commit.
<p class="Pp">This behavior can be suppressed with the <b>--no-ff</b>
  option.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="TRUE_MERGE"><a class="permalink" href="#TRUE_MERGE">TRUE
  MERGE</a></h1>
Except in a fast-forward merge (see above), the branches to be merged must be
  tied together by a merge commit that has both of them as its parents.
<p class="Pp">A merged version reconciling the changes from all branches to be
    merged is committed, and your <b>HEAD</b>, index, and working tree are
    updated to it. It is possible to have modifications in the working tree as
    long as they do not overlap; the update will preserve them.</p>
<p class="Pp">When it is not obvious how to reconcile the changes, the following
    happens:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 1.The <b>HEAD</b> pointer stays the same.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 2.The <b>MERGE_HEAD</b> ref is set to point to the other
  branch head.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 3.Paths that merged cleanly are updated both in the
  index file and in your working tree.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 4.For conflicting paths, the index file records up to
  three versions: stage 1 stores the version from the common ancestor, stage 2
  from <b>HEAD</b>, and stage 3 from <b>MERGE_HEAD</b> (you can inspect the
  stages with <b>git ls-files -u</b>). The working tree files contain the result
  of the &quot;merge&quot; program; i.e. 3-way merge results with familiar
  conflict markers <b>&lt;&lt;&lt;</b> <b>===</b> <b>&gt;&gt;&gt;</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 5.No other changes are made. In particular, the local
  modifications you had before you started merge will stay the same and the
  index entries for them stay as they were, i.e. matching <b>HEAD</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">If you tried a merge which resulted in complex conflicts and want
    to start over, you can recover with <b>git merge --abort</b>.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="MERGING_TAG"><a class="permalink" href="#MERGING_TAG">MERGING
  TAG</a></h1>
When merging an annotated (and possibly signed) tag, Git always creates a merge
  commit even if a fast-forward merge is possible, and the commit message
  template is prepared with the tag message. Additionally, if the tag is signed,
  the signature check is reported as a comment in the message template. See also
  <b>git-tag</b>(1).
<p class="Pp">When you want to just integrate with the work leading to the
    commit that happens to be tagged, e.g. synchronizing with an upstream
    release point, you may not want to make an unnecessary merge commit.</p>
<p class="Pp">In such a case, you can &quot;unwrap&quot; the tag yourself before
    feeding it to <b>git merge</b>, or pass <b>--ff-only</b> when you do not
    have any work on your own. e.g.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
git fetch origin
git merge v1.2.3^0
git merge --ff-only v1.2.3
</pre>

<h1 class="Sh" id="HOW_CONFLICTS_ARE_PRESENTED"><a class="permalink" href="#HOW_CONFLICTS_ARE_PRESENTED">HOW
  CONFLICTS ARE PRESENTED</a></h1>
During a merge, the working tree files are updated to reflect the result of the
  merge. Among the changes made to the common ancestor&#x2019;s version,
  non-overlapping ones (that is, you changed an area of the file while the other
  side left that area intact, or vice versa) are incorporated in the final
  result verbatim. When both sides made changes to the same area, however, Git
  cannot randomly pick one side over the other, and asks you to resolve it by
  leaving what both sides did to that area.
<p class="Pp">By default, Git uses the same style as the one used by the
    &quot;merge&quot; program from the RCS suite to present such a conflicted
    hunk, like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
Here are lines that are either unchanged from the common
ancestor, or cleanly resolved because only one side changed.
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; yours:sample.txt
Conflict resolution is hard;
let's go shopping.
=======
Git makes conflict resolution easy.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; theirs:sample.txt
And here is another line that is cleanly resolved or unmodified.
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">The area where a pair of conflicting changes happened is marked
    with markers <b>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</b>, <b>=======</b>, and
    <b>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</b>. The part before the <b>=======</b> is
    typically your side, and the part afterwards is typically their side.</p>
<p class="Pp">The default format does not show what the original said in the
    conflicting area. You cannot tell how many lines are deleted and replaced
    with Barbie&#x2019;s remark on your side. The only thing you can tell is
    that your side wants to say it is hard and you&#x2019;d prefer to go
    shopping, while the other side wants to claim it is easy.</p>
<p class="Pp">An alternative style can be used by setting the
    &quot;merge.conflictStyle&quot; configuration variable to &quot;diff3&quot;.
    In &quot;diff3&quot; style, the above conflict may look like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>

ancestor, or cleanly resolved because only one side changed.

<p class="Pp">In addition to the <b>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</b>,
    <b>=======</b>, and <b>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</b> markers, it uses
    another <b>|||||||</b> marker that is followed by the original text. You can
    tell that the original just stated a fact, and your side simply gave in to
    that statement and gave up, while the other side tried to have a more
    positive attitude. You can sometimes come up with a better resolution by
    viewing the original.</p>

  TO RESOLVE CONFLICTS</a></h1>
After seeing a conflict, you can do two things:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Decide not to merge. The only clean-ups you need
  are to reset the index file to the <b>HEAD</b> commit to reverse 2. and to
  clean up working tree changes made by 2. and 3.; <b>git merge --abort</b> can
  be used for this.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Resolve the conflicts. Git will mark the
  conflicts in the working tree. Edit the files into shape and <i>git add</i>
  them to the index. Use <i>git commit</i> or <i>git merge --continue</i> to
  seal the deal. The latter command checks whether there is a (interrupted)
  merge in progress before calling <i>git commit</i>.</div>
<p class="Pp">You can work through the conflict with a number of tools:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Use a mergetool. <b>git mergetool</b> to launch a
  graphical mergetool which will work you through the merge.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Look at the diffs. <b>git diff</b> will show a
  three-way diff, highlighting changes from both the <b>HEAD</b> and
  <b>MERGE_HEAD</b> versions.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Look at the diffs from each branch. <b>git log
  --merge -p &lt;path&gt;</b> will show diffs first for the <b>HEAD</b> version
  and then the <b>MERGE_HEAD</b> version.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Look at the originals. <b>git show
  :1:filename</b> shows the common ancestor, <b>git show :2:filename</b> shows

<h1 class="Sh" id="MERGE_STRATEGIES"><a class="permalink" href="#MERGE_STRATEGIES">MERGE
  STRATEGIES</a></h1>
The merge mechanism (<b>git merge</b> and <b>git pull</b> commands) allows the
  backend <i>merge strategies</i> to be chosen with <b>-s</b> option. Some
  strategies can also take their own options, which can be passed by giving
  <b>-X&lt;option&gt;</b> arguments to <b>git merge</b> and/or <b>git pull</b>.
<p class="Pp">resolve</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This can only resolve two heads (i.e. the current branch
  and another branch you pulled from) using a 3-way merge algorithm. It tries to
  carefully detect criss-cross merge ambiguities and is considered generally
  safe and fast.</div>
<p class="Pp">recursive</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This can only resolve two heads using a 3-way merge
  algorithm. When there is more than one common ancestor that can be used for
  3-way merge, it creates a merged tree of the common ancestors and uses that as
  the reference tree for the 3-way merge. This has been reported to result in
  fewer merge conflicts without causing mismerges by tests done on actual merge
  commits taken from Linux 2.6 kernel development history. Additionally this can
  detect and handle merges involving renames, but currently cannot make use of
  detected copies. This is the default merge strategy when pulling or merging
  one branch.
<p class="Pp">The <i>recursive</i> strategy can take the following options:</p>
<p class="Pp">ours</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This option forces conflicting hunks to be auto-resolved
  cleanly by favoring <i>our</i> version. Changes from the other tree that do
  not conflict with our side are reflected to the merge result. For a binary
  file, the entire contents are taken from our side.
<p class="Pp">This should not be confused with the <i>ours</i> merge strategy,
    which does not even look at what the other tree contains at all. It discards
    everything the other tree did, declaring <i>our</i> history contains all
    that happened in it.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">theirs</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This is the opposite of <i>ours</i>; note that, unlike
  <i>ours</i>, there is no <i>theirs</i> merge strategy to confuse this merge
  option with.</div>
<p class="Pp">patience</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">With this option, <i>merge-recursive</i> spends a little
  extra time to avoid mismerges that sometimes occur due to unimportant matching
  lines (e.g., braces from distinct functions). Use this when the branches to be
  merged have diverged wildly. See also <b>git-diff</b>(1)
  <b>--patience</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">diff-algorithm=[patience|minimal|histogram|myers]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Tells <i>merge-recursive</i> to use a different diff
  algorithm, which can help avoid mismerges that occur due to unimportant
  matching lines (such as braces from distinct functions). See also
  <b>git-diff</b>(1) <b>--diff-algorithm</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">ignore-space-change, ignore-all-space, ignore-space-at-eol,
    ignore-cr-at-eol</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Treats lines with the indicated type of whitespace change
  as unchanged for the sake of a three-way merge. Whitespace changes mixed with
  other changes to a line are not ignored. See also <b>git-diff</b>(1)
  <b>-b</b>, <b>-w</b>, <b>--ignore-space-at-eol</b>, and
  <b>--ignore-cr-at-eol</b>.
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;If <i>their</i> version only introduces
  whitespace changes to a line, <i>our</i> version is used;</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;If <i>our</i> version introduces whitespace
  changes but <i>their</i> version includes a substantial change, <i>their</i>
  version is used;</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Otherwise, the merge proceeds in the usual
  way.</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp">renormalize</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This runs a virtual check-out and check-in of all three
  stages of a file when resolving a three-way merge. This option is meant to be
  used when merging branches with different clean filters or end-of-line
  normalization rules. See &quot;Merging branches with differing
  checkin/checkout attributes&quot; in <b>gitattributes</b>(5) for
  details.</div>
<p class="Pp">no-renormalize</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Disables the <b>renormalize</b> option. This overrides
  the <b>merge.renormalize</b> configuration variable.</div>
<p class="Pp">no-renames</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Turn off rename detection. This overrides the
  <b>merge.renames</b> configuration variable. See also <b>git-diff</b>(1)
  <b>--no-renames</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">find-renames[=&lt;n&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Turn on rename detection, optionally setting the
  similarity threshold. This is the default. This overrides the
  <i>merge.renames</i> configuration variable. See also <b>git-diff</b>(1)
  <b>--find-renames</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">rename-threshold=&lt;n&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Deprecated synonym for
  <b>find-renames=&lt;n&gt;</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">subtree[=&lt;path&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This option is a more advanced form of <i>subtree</i>
  strategy, where the strategy makes a guess on how two trees must be shifted to
  match with each other when merging. Instead, the specified path is prefixed
  (or stripped from the beginning) to make the shape of two trees to
  match.</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp">octopus</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This resolves cases with more than two heads, but refuses
  to do a complex merge that needs manual resolution. It is primarily meant to
  be used for bundling topic branch heads together. This is the default merge
  strategy when pulling or merging more than one branch.</div>
<p class="Pp">ours</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This resolves any number of heads, but the resulting tree
  of the merge is always that of the current branch head, effectively ignoring
  all changes from all other branches. It is meant to be used to supersede old
  development history of side branches. Note that this is different from the
  -Xours option to the <i>recursive</i> merge strategy.</div>
<p class="Pp">subtree</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This is a modified recursive strategy. When merging trees
  A and B, if B corresponds to a subtree of A, B is first adjusted to match the
  tree structure of A, instead of reading the trees at the same level. This
  adjustment is also done to the common ancestor tree.</div>
<p class="Pp">With the strategies that use 3-way merge (including the default,
    <i>recursive</i>), if a change is made on both branches, but later reverted
    on one of the branches, that change will be present in the merged result;
    some people find this behavior confusing. It occurs because only the heads
    and the merge base are considered when performing a merge, not the
    individual commits. The merge algorithm therefore considers the reverted
    change as no change at all, and substitutes the changed version instead.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="CONFIGURATION"><a class="permalink" href="#CONFIGURATION">CONFIGURATION</a></h1>
merge.conflictStyle
<div class="Bd-indent">Specify the style in which conflicted hunks are written
  out to working tree files upon merge. The default is &quot;merge&quot;, which
  shows a <b>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</b> conflict marker, changes made by
  one side, a <b>=======</b> marker, changes made by the other side, and then a
  <b>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</b> marker. An alternate style,
  &quot;diff3&quot;, adds a <b>|||||||</b> marker and the original text before
  the <b>=======</b> marker.</div>
<p class="Pp">merge.defaultToUpstream</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If merge is called without any commit argument, merge the
  upstream branches configured for the current branch by using their last
  observed values stored in their remote-tracking branches. The values of the
  <b>branch.&lt;current branch&gt;.merge</b> that name the branches at the
  remote named by <b>branch.&lt;current branch&gt;.remote</b> are consulted, and
  then they are mapped via <b>remote.&lt;remote&gt;.fetch</b> to their
  corresponding remote-tracking branches, and the tips of these tracking
  branches are merged.</div>
<p class="Pp">merge.ff</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">By default, Git does not create an extra merge commit
  when merging a commit that is a descendant of the current commit. Instead, the
  tip of the current branch is fast-forwarded. When set to <b>false</b>, this
  variable tells Git to create an extra merge commit in such a case (equivalent
  to giving the <b>--no-ff</b> option from the command line). When set to
  <b>only</b>, only such fast-forward merges are allowed (equivalent to giving
  the <b>--ff-only</b> option from the command line).</div>
<p class="Pp">merge.verifySignatures</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If true, this is equivalent to the --verify-signatures
  command line option. See <b>git-merge</b>(1) for details.</div>
<p class="Pp">merge.branchdesc</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">In addition to branch names, populate the log message
  with the branch description text associated with them. Defaults to
  false.</div>
<p class="Pp">merge.log</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">In addition to branch names, populate the log message
  with at most the specified number of one-line descriptions from the actual
  commits that are being merged. Defaults to false, and true is a synonym for
  20.</div>
<p class="Pp">merge.renameLimit</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The number of files to consider when performing rename
  detection during a merge; if not specified, defaults to the value of
  diff.renameLimit. This setting has no effect if rename detection is turned
  off.</div>
<p class="Pp">merge.renames</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Whether and how Git detects renames. If set to
  &quot;false&quot;, rename detection is disabled. If set to &quot;true&quot;,
  basic rename detection is enabled. Defaults to the value of
  diff.renames.</div>
<p class="Pp">merge.renormalize</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Tell Git that canonical representation of files in the
  repository has changed over time (e.g. earlier commits record text files with
  CRLF line endings, but recent ones use LF line endings). In such a repository,
  Git can convert the data recorded in commits to a canonical form before
  performing a merge to reduce unnecessary conflicts. For more information, see
  section &quot;Merging branches with differing checkin/checkout
  attributes&quot; in <b>gitattributes</b>(5).</div>
<p class="Pp">merge.stat</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Whether to print the diffstat between ORIG_HEAD and the
  merge result at the end of the merge. True by default.</div>
<p class="Pp">merge.tool</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Controls which merge tool is used by
  <b>git-mergetool</b>(1). The list below shows the valid built-in values. Any
  other value is treated as a custom merge tool and requires that a
  corresponding mergetool.&lt;tool&gt;.cmd variable is defined.</div>
<p class="Pp">merge.guitool</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Controls which merge tool is used by
  <b>git-mergetool</b>(1) when the -g/--gui flag is specified. The list below
  shows the valid built-in values. Any other value is treated as a custom merge
  tool and requires that a corresponding mergetool.&lt;guitool&gt;.cmd variable
  is defined.
