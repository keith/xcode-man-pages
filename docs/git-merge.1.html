<p class="Pp">Incorporates changes from the named commits (since the time their
    histories diverged from the current branch) into the current branch. This
    command is used by <b>git</b> <b>pull</b> to incorporate changes from
    another repository and can be used by hand to merge changes from one branch
    into another.</p>
<p class="Pp">Assume the following history exists and the current branch is
    <b>master</b>:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<br/>
          A---B---C topic
<br/>
         /
<br/>
    D---E---F---G master</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Then <b>git</b> <b>merge</b> <b>topic</b> will replay the changes
    made on the <b>topic</b> branch since it diverged from <b>master</b> (i.e.,
    <b>E</b>) until its current commit (<b>C</b>) on top of <b>master</b>, and
    record the result in a new commit along with the names of the two parent
    commits and a log message from the user describing the changes. Before the
    operation, <b>ORIG_HEAD</b> is set to the tip of the current branch
    (<b>G</b>).</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>

</div>
<p class="Pp">A merge stops if there&#x2019;s a conflict that cannot be resolved
    automatically or if <b>--no-commit</b> was provided when initiating the
    merge. At that point you can run <b>git</b> <b>merge</b> <b>--abort</b> or
    <b>git</b> <b>merge</b> <b>--continue</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>git</b> <b>merge</b> <b>--abort</b> will abort the merge
    process and try to reconstruct the pre-merge state. However, if there were
    uncommitted changes when the merge started (and especially if those changes
    were further modified after the merge was started), <b>git</b> <b>merge</b>
    <b>--abort</b> will in some cases be unable to reconstruct the original
    (pre-merge) changes. Therefore:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<br/>
<b>Warning</b>
<p class="Pp">Running <b>git</b> <b>merge</b> with non-trivial uncommitted
    changes is discouraged: while possible, it may leave you in a state that is
    hard to back out of in the case of a conflict.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp"><b>--commit</b>, <b>--no-commit</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Perform the merge and commit the result. This option can
  be used to override <b>--no-commit</b>.
<p class="Pp">With <b>--no-commit</b> perform the merge and stop just before
    creating a merge commit, to give the user a chance to inspect and further
    tweak the merge result before committing.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that fast-forward updates do not create a merge commit and
    therefore there is no way to stop those merges with <b>--no-commit</b>.
    Thus, if you want to ensure your branch is not changed or updated by the
    merge command, use <b>--no-ff</b> with <b>--no-commit</b>.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>--edit</b>, <b>-e</b>, <b>--no-edit</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Invoke an editor before committing successful mechanical
  merge to further edit the auto-generated merge message, so that the user can
  explain and justify the merge. The <b>--no-edit</b> option can be used to
  accept the auto-generated message (this is generally discouraged). The
  <b>--edit</b> (or <b>-e</b>) option is still useful if you are giving a draft
  message with the <b>-m</b> option from the command line and want to edit it in
  the editor.
<p class="Pp">Older scripts may depend on the historical behaviour of not
    allowing the user to edit the merge log message. They will see an editor
    opened when they run <b>git</b> <b>merge</b>. To make it easier to adjust
    such scripts to the updated behaviour, the environment variable
    <b>GIT_MERGE_AUTOEDIT</b> can be set to <b>no</b> at the beginning of
  them.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>--cleanup=</b><i>&lt;mode&gt;</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This option determines how the merge message will be
  cleaned up before committing. See <b>git-commit</b>(1) for more details. In
  addition, if the <i>&lt;mode&gt;</i> is given a value of <b>scissors</b>,
  scissors will be appended to <b>MERGE_MSG</b> before being passed on to the
  commit machinery in the case of a merge conflict.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>--ff</b>, <b>--no-ff</b>, <b>--ff-only</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Specifies how a merge is handled when the merged-in
  history is already a descendant of the current history. <b>--ff</b> is the
  default unless merging an annotated (and possibly signed) tag that is not
  stored in its natural place in the <b>refs/tags/</b> hierarchy, in which case
  <b>--no-ff</b> is assumed.
<p class="Pp">With <b>--ff</b>, when possible resolve the merge as a
    fast-forward (only update the branch pointer to match the merged branch; do
    not create a merge commit). When not possible (when the merged-in history is
    not a descendant of the current history), create a merge commit.</p>
<p class="Pp">With <b>--no-ff</b>, create a merge commit in all cases, even when
    the merge could instead be resolved as a fast-forward.</p>
<p class="Pp">With <b>--ff-only</b>, resolve the merge as a fast-forward when
    possible. When not possible, refuse to merge and exit with a non-zero
    status.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>-S</b>[<i>&lt;key-id&gt;</i>],
    <b>--gpg-sign</b>[<b>=</b><i>&lt;key-id&gt;</i>], <b>--no-gpg-sign</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">GPG-sign the resulting merge commit. The
  <i>&lt;key-id&gt;</i> argument is optional and defaults to the committer
  identity; if specified, it must be stuck to the option without a space.
  <b>--no-gpg-sign</b> is useful to countermand both <b>commit.gpgSign</b>
  configuration variable, and earlier <b>--gpg-sign</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>--log</b>[<b>=</b><i>&lt;n&gt;</i>], <b>--no-log</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">In addition to branch names, populate the log message
  with one-line descriptions from at most <i>&lt;n&gt;</i> actual commits that
  are being merged. See also <b>git-fmt-merge-msg</b>(1).
<p class="Pp">With <b>--no-log</b> do not list one-line descriptions from the
    actual commits being merged.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>--signoff</b>, <b>--no-signoff</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Add a <b>Signed-off-by</b> trailer by the committer at
  the end of the commit log message. The meaning of a signoff depends on the
  project to which you&#x2019;re committing. For example, it may certify that
  the committer has the rights to submit the work under the project&#x2019;s
  license or agrees to some contributor representation, such as a Developer
  Certificate of Origin. (See <b>https://developercertificate.org</b> for the
  one used by the Linux kernel and Git projects.) Consult the documentation or
  leadership of the project to which you&#x2019;re contributing to understand
  how the signoffs are used in that project.
<p class="Pp">The <b>--no-signoff</b> option can be used to countermand an
    earlier <b>--signoff</b> option on the command line.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>--stat</b>, <b>-n</b>, <b>--no-stat</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show a diffstat at the end of the merge. The diffstat is
  also controlled by the configuration option merge.stat.
<p class="Pp">With <b>-n</b> or <b>--no-stat</b> do not show a diffstat at the
    end of the merge.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>--compact-summary</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show a compact-summary at the end of the merge.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>--squash</b>, <b>--no-squash</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Produce the working tree and index state as if a real
  merge happened (except for the merge information), but do not actually make a
  commit, move the <b>HEAD</b>, or record <b>$GIT_DIR/MERGE_HEAD</b> (to cause
  the next <b>git</b> <b>commit</b> command to create a merge commit). This
  allows you to create a single commit on top of the current branch whose effect
  is the same as merging another branch (or more in case of an octopus).
<p class="Pp">With <b>--no-squash</b> perform the merge and commit the result.
    This option can be used to override <b>--squash</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">With <b>--squash</b>, <b>--commit</b> is not allowed, and will
    fail.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>--</b>[<b>no-</b>]<b>verify</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">By default, the pre-merge and commit-msg hooks are run.
  When <b>--no-verify</b> is given, these are bypassed. See also
  <b>githooks</b>(5).</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>-s</b> <i>&lt;strategy&gt;</i>,
    <b>--strategy=</b><i>&lt;strategy&gt;</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Use the given merge strategy; can be supplied more than
  once to specify them in the order they should be tried. If there is no
  <b>-s</b> option, a built-in list of strategies is used instead (<b>ort</b>
  when merging a single head, <b>octopus</b> otherwise).</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>-X</b> <i>&lt;option&gt;</i>,
    <b>--strategy-option=</b><i>&lt;option&gt;</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Pass merge strategy specific option through to the merge
  strategy.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>--verify-signatures</b>, <b>--no-verify-signatures</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Verify that the tip commit of the side branch being
  merged is signed with a valid key, i.e. a key that has a valid uid: in the
  default trust model, this means the signing key has been signed by a trusted
  key. If the tip commit of the side branch is not signed with a valid key, the
  merge is aborted.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>--summary</b>, <b>--no-summary</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Synonyms to <b>--stat</b> and <b>--no-stat</b>; these are
  deprecated and will be removed in the future.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>-q</b>, <b>--quiet</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Operate quietly. Implies <b>--no-progress</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Be verbose.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>--progress</b>, <b>--no-progress</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Turn progress on/off explicitly. If neither is specified,
  progress is shown if standard error is connected to a terminal. Note that not
  all merge strategies may support progress reporting.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>--autostash</b>, <b>--no-autostash</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Automatically create a temporary stash entry before the
  operation begins, record it in the ref <b>MERGE_AUTOSTASH</b> and apply it
  after the operation ends. This means that you can run the operation on a dirty
  worktree. However, use with care: the final stash application after a
  successful merge might result in non-trivial conflicts.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>--allow-unrelated-histories</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">By default, <b>git</b> <b>merge</b> command refuses to
  merge histories that do not share a common ancestor. This option can be used
  to override this safety when merging histories of two projects that started
  their lives independently. As that is a very rare occasion, no configuration
  variable to enable this by default exists or will be added.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>-m</b> <i>&lt;msg&gt;</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Set the commit message to be used for the merge commit
  (in case one is created).
<p class="Pp">If <b>--log</b> is specified, a shortlog of the commits being
    merged will be appended to the specified message.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>git</b> <b>fmt-merge-msg</b> command can be used to give a
    good default for automated <b>git</b> <b>merge</b> invocations. The
    automated message can include the branch description.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>--into-name</b> <i>&lt;branch&gt;</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Prepare the default merge message as if merging to the
  branch <i>&lt;branch&gt;</i>, instead of the name of the real branch to which
  the merge is made.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>-F</b> <i>&lt;file&gt;</i>,
  <b>--file=</b><i>&lt;file&gt;</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Read the commit message to be used for the merge commit
  (in case one is created).
<p class="Pp">If <b>--log</b> is specified, a shortlog of the commits being
    merged will be appended to the specified message.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>--rerere-autoupdate</b>, <b>--no-rerere-autoupdate</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">After the rerere mechanism reuses a recorded resolution
  on the current conflict to update the files in the working tree, allow it to
  also update the index with the result of resolution.
  <b>--no-rerere-autoupdate</b> is a good way to double-check what <b>rerere</b>
  did and catch potential mismerges, before committing the result to the index
  with a separate <b>git</b> <b>add</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>--overwrite-ignore</b>, <b>--no-overwrite-ignore</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Silently overwrite ignored files from the merge result.
  This is the default behavior. Use <b>--no-overwrite-ignore</b> to abort.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>--abort</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Abort the current conflict resolution process, and try to
  reconstruct the pre-merge state. If an autostash entry is present, apply it to
  the worktree.
<p class="Pp">If there were uncommitted worktree changes present when the merge
    started, <b>git</b> <b>merge</b> <b>--abort</b> will in some cases be unable
    to reconstruct these changes. It is therefore recommended to always commit
    or stash your changes before running <b>git</b> <b>merge</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>git</b> <b>merge</b> <b>--abort</b> is equivalent to <b>git</b>
    <b>reset</b> <b>--merge</b> when <b>MERGE_HEAD</b> is present unless
    <b>MERGE_AUTOSTASH</b> is also present in which case <b>git</b> <b>merge</b>
    <b>--abort</b> applies the stash entry to the worktree whereas <b>git</b>
    <b>reset</b> <b>--merge</b> will save the stashed changes in the stash
  list.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>--quit</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Forget about the current merge in progress. Leave the
  index and the working tree as-is. If <b>MERGE_AUTOSTASH</b> is present, the
  stash entry will be saved to the stash list.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>--continue</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">After a <b>git</b> <b>merge</b> stops due to conflicts
  you can conclude the merge by running <b>git</b> <b>merge</b>
  <b>--continue</b> (see &quot;HOW TO RESOLVE CONFLICTS&quot; section
  below).</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>&lt;commit&gt;</i>...</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Commits, usually other branch heads, to merge into our
  branch. Specifying more than one commit will create a merge with more than two
  parents (affectionately called an Octopus merge).
<p class="Pp">If no commit is given from the command line, merge the
    remote-tracking branches that the current branch is configured to use as its
    upstream. See also the configuration section of this manual page.</p>
<p class="Pp">When <b>FETCH_HEAD</b> (and no other commit) is specified, the
    branches recorded in the .<b>git/FETCH_HEAD</b> file by the previous
    invocation of <b>git</b> <b>fetch</b> for merging are merged to the current
    branch.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="PRE"><a class="permalink" href="#PRE">PRE-MERGE
  CHECKS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Before applying outside changes, you should get your own work in
    good shape and committed locally, so it will not be clobbered if there are
    conflicts. See also <b>git-stash</b>(1). <b>git</b> <b>pull</b> and
    <b>git</b> <b>merge</b> will stop without doing anything when local
    uncommitted changes overlap with files that <b>git</b>
    <b>pull</b>/<b>git</b> <b>merge</b> may need to update.</p>
<p class="Pp">To avoid recording unrelated changes in the merge commit,
    <b>git</b> <b>pull</b> and <b>git</b> <b>merge</b> will also abort if there
    are any changes registered in the index relative to the <b>HEAD</b> commit.
    (Special narrow exceptions to this rule may exist depending on which merge
    strategy is in use, but generally, the index must match <b>HEAD</b>.)</p>
<p class="Pp">If all named commits are already ancestors of <b>HEAD</b>,
    <b>git</b> <b>merge</b> will exit early with the message &quot;Already up to
    date.&quot;</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="FAST"><a class="permalink" href="#FAST">FAST-FORWARD
  MERGE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Often the current branch head is an ancestor of the named commit.
    This is the most common case especially when invoked from <b>git</b>
    <b>pull</b>: you are tracking an upstream repository, you have committed no
    local changes, and now you want to update to a newer upstream revision. In
    this case, a new commit is not needed to store the combined history;
    instead, the <b>HEAD</b> (along with the index) is updated to point at the
    named commit, without creating an extra merge commit.</p>
<p class="Pp">This behavior can be suppressed with the <b>--no-ff</b>
  option.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="TRUE_MERGE"><a class="permalink" href="#TRUE_MERGE">TRUE
  MERGE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Except in a fast-forward merge (see above), the branches to be
    merged must be tied together by a merge commit that has both of them as its
    parents.</p>
<p class="Pp">A merged version reconciling the changes from all branches to be
    merged is committed, and your <b>HEAD</b>, index, and working tree are
    updated to it. It is possible to have modifications in the working tree as
    long as they do not overlap; the update will preserve them.</p>
<p class="Pp">When it is not obvious how to reconcile the changes, the following
    happens:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 1.The <b>HEAD</b> pointer stays the same.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 2.The <b>MERGE_HEAD</b> ref is set to point to the other
  branch head.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 3.Paths that merged cleanly are updated both in the
  index file and in your working tree.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 4.For conflicting paths, the index file records up to
  three versions: stage 1 stores the version from the common ancestor, stage 2
  from <b>HEAD</b>, and stage 3 from <b>MERGE_HEAD</b> (you can inspect the
  stages with <b>git</b> <b>ls-files</b> <b>-u</b>). The working tree files
  contain the result of the merge operation; i.e. 3-way merge results with
  familiar conflict markers &lt;&lt;&lt; <b>===</b> &gt;&gt;&gt;.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 5.A ref named <b>AUTO_MERGE</b> is written, pointing to
  a tree corresponding to the current content of the working tree (including
  conflict markers for textual conflicts). Note that this ref is only written
  when the <b>ort</b> merge strategy is used (the default).</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 6.No other changes are made. In particular, the local
  modifications you had before you started merge will stay the same and the
  index entries for them stay as they were, i.e. matching <b>HEAD</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">If you tried a merge which resulted in complex conflicts and want
    to start over, you can recover with <b>git</b> <b>merge</b>
  <b>--abort</b>.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="MERGING_TAG"><a class="permalink" href="#MERGING_TAG">MERGING
  TAG</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">When merging an annotated (and possibly signed) tag, Git always
    creates a merge commit even if a fast-forward merge is possible, and the
    commit message template is prepared with the tag message. Additionally, if
    the tag is signed, the signature check is reported as a comment in the
    message template. See also <b>git-tag</b>(1).</p>
<p class="Pp">When you want to just integrate with the work leading to the
    commit that happens to be tagged, e.g. synchronizing with an upstream
    release point, you may not want to make an unnecessary merge commit.</p>
<p class="Pp">In such a case, you can &quot;unwrap&quot; the tag yourself before
    feeding it to <b>git</b> <b>merge</b>, or pass <b>--ff-only</b> when you do
    not have any work on your own. e.g.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>git fetch origin
git merge v1.2.3^0
git merge --ff-only v1.2.3</pre>
</div>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="HOW_CONFLICTS_ARE_PRESENTED"><a class="permalink" href="#HOW_CONFLICTS_ARE_PRESENTED">HOW
  CONFLICTS ARE PRESENTED</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">During a merge, the working tree files are updated to reflect the
    result of the merge. Among the changes made to the common ancestor&#x2019;s
    version, non-overlapping ones (that is, you changed an area of the file
    while the other side left that area intact, or vice versa) are incorporated
    in the final result verbatim. When both sides made changes to the same area,
    however, Git cannot randomly pick one side over the other, and asks you to
    resolve it by leaving what both sides did to that area.</p>
<p class="Pp">By default, Git uses the same style as the one used by the
    &quot;merge&quot; program from the RCS suite to present such a conflicted
    hunk, like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>Here are lines that are either unchanged from the common
ancestor, or cleanly resolved because only one side changed,
or cleanly resolved because both sides changed the same way.
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; yours:sample.txt
Conflict resolution is hard;
let's go shopping.
=======
Git makes conflict resolution easy.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; theirs:sample.txt
And here is another line that is cleanly resolved or unmodified.</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The area where a pair of conflicting changes happened is marked
    with markers &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;, <b>=======</b>, and
    &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;. The part before the <b>=======</b> is
    typically your side, and the part afterwards is typically their side.</p>
<p class="Pp">The default format does not show what the original said in the
    conflicting area. You cannot tell how many lines are deleted and replaced
    with Barbie&#x2019;s remark on your side. The only thing you can tell is
    that your side wants to say it is hard and you&#x2019;d prefer to go
    shopping, while the other side wants to claim it is easy.</p>
<p class="Pp">An alternative style can be used by setting the

  TO RESOLVE CONFLICTS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">After seeing a conflict, you can do two things:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Decide not to merge. The only clean-ups you need
  are to reset the index file to the <b>HEAD</b> commit to reverse 2. and to
  clean up working tree changes made by 2. and 3.; <b>git</b> <b>merge</b>
  <b>--abort</b> can be used for this.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Resolve the conflicts. Git will mark the
  conflicts in the working tree. Edit the files into shape and <b>git</b>
  <b>add</b> them to the index. Use <b>git</b> <b>commit</b> or <b>git</b>
  <b>merge</b> <b>--continue</b> to seal the deal. The latter command checks
  whether there is a (interrupted) merge in progress before calling <b>git</b>
  <b>commit</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">You can work through the conflict with a number of tools:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Use a mergetool. <b>git</b> <b>mergetool</b> to
  launch a graphical mergetool which will work through the merge with you.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Look at the diffs. <b>git</b> <b>diff</b> will
  show a three-way diff, highlighting changes from both the <b>HEAD</b> and
  <b>MERGE_HEAD</b> versions. <b>git</b> <b>diff</b> <b>AUTO_MERGE</b> will show
  what changes you&#x2019;ve made so far to resolve textual conflicts.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Look at the diffs from each branch. <b>git</b>
  <b>log</b> <b>--merge</b> <b>-p</b> <i>&lt;path&gt;</i> will show diffs first
  for the <b>HEAD</b> version and then the <b>MERGE_HEAD</b> version.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Look at the originals. <b>git</b> <b>show</b>
  <b>:1:filename</b> shows the common ancestor, <b>git</b> <b>show</b>

<h1 class="Sh" id="MERGE_STRATEGIES"><a class="permalink" href="#MERGE_STRATEGIES">MERGE
  STRATEGIES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The merge mechanism (<b>git</b> <b>merge</b> and <b>git</b>
    <b>pull</b> commands) allows the backend <i>merge strategies</i> to be
    chosen with <b>-s</b> option. Some strategies can also take their own
    options, which can be passed by giving <b>-X</b><i>&lt;option&gt;</i>
    arguments to <b>git</b> <b>merge</b> and/or <b>git</b> <b>pull</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>ort</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This is the default merge strategy when pulling or
  merging one branch. This strategy can only resolve two heads using a 3-way
  merge algorithm. When there is more than one common ancestor that can be used
  for 3-way merge, it creates a merged tree of the common ancestors and uses
  that as the reference tree for the 3-way merge. This has been reported to
  result in fewer merge conflicts without causing mismerges by tests done on
  actual merge commits taken from Linux 2.6 kernel development history.
  Additionally this strategy can detect and handle merges involving renames. It
  does not make use of detected copies. The name for this algorithm is an
  acronym (&quot;Ostensibly Recursive&#x2019;s Twin&quot;) and came from the
  fact that it was written as a replacement for the previous default algorithm,
  <b>recursive</b>.
<p class="Pp">In the case where the path is a submodule, if the submodule commit
    used on one side of the merge is a descendant of the submodule commit used
    on the other side of the merge, Git attempts to fast-forward to the
    descendant. Otherwise, Git will treat this case as a conflict, suggesting as
    a resolution a submodule commit that is descendant of the conflicting ones,
    if one exists.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>ort</b> strategy can take the following options:</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>ours</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This option forces conflicting hunks to be auto-resolved
  cleanly by favoring <i>our</i> version. Changes from the other tree that do
  not conflict with our side are reflected in the merge result. For a binary
  file, the entire contents are taken from our side.
<p class="Pp">This should not be confused with the <b>ours</b> merge strategy,
    which does not even look at what the other tree contains at all. It discards
    everything the other tree did, declaring <i>our</i> history contains all
    that happened in it.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>theirs</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This is the opposite of <b>ours</b>; note that, unlike
  <b>ours</b>, there is no <b>theirs</b> merge strategy to confuse this merge
  option with.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>ignore-space-change</b>, <b>ignore-all-space</b>,
    <b>ignore-space-at-eol</b>, <b>ignore-cr-at-eol</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Treats lines with the indicated type of whitespace change
  as unchanged for the sake of a three-way merge. Whitespace changes mixed with
  other changes to a line are not ignored. See also <b>git-diff</b>(1)
  <b>-b</b>, <b>-w</b>, <b>--ignore-space-at-eol</b>, and
  <b>--ignore-cr-at-eol</b>.
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;If <i>their</i> version only introduces
  whitespace changes to a line, <i>our</i> version is used;</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;If <i>our</i> version introduces whitespace
  changes but <i>their</i> version includes a substantial change, <i>their</i>
  version is used;</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Otherwise, the merge proceeds in the usual
  way.</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>renormalize</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This runs a virtual check-out and check-in of all three
  stages of any file which needs a three-way merge. This option is meant to be
  used when merging branches with different clean filters or end-of-line
  normalization rules. See &quot;Merging branches with differing
  checkin/checkout attributes&quot; in <b>gitattributes</b>(5) for
  details.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>no-renormalize</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Disables the <b>renormalize</b> option. This overrides
  the <b>merge.renormalize</b> configuration variable.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>find-renames</b>[<b>=</b><i>&lt;n&gt;</i>]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Turn on rename detection, optionally setting the
  similarity threshold. This is the default. This overrides the
  <b>merge.renames</b> configuration variable. See also <b>git-diff</b>(1)
  <b>--find-renames</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>rename-threshold=</b><i>&lt;n&gt;</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Deprecated synonym for
  <b>find-renames=</b><i>&lt;n&gt;</i>.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>no-renames</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Turn off rename detection. This overrides the
  <b>merge.renames</b> configuration variable. See also <b>git-diff</b>(1)
  <b>--no-renames</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>histogram</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Deprecated synonym for
  <b>diff-algorithm=histogram</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>patience</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Deprecated synonym for
  <b>diff-algorithm=patience</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>diff-algorithm=</b>(<b>histogram</b>|<b>minimal</b>|<b>myers</b>|<b>patience</b>)</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Use a different diff algorithm while merging, which can
  help avoid mismerges that occur due to unimportant matching lines (such as
  braces from distinct functions). See also <b>git-diff</b>(1)
  <b>--diff-algorithm</b>. Note that <b>ort</b> defaults to
  <b>diff-algorithm=histogram</b>, while regular diffs currently default to the
  <b>diff.algorithm</b> config setting.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>subtree</b>[<b>=</b><i>&lt;path&gt;</i>]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This option is a more advanced form of <i>subtree</i>
  strategy, where the strategy makes a guess on how two trees must be shifted to
  match with each other when merging. Instead, the specified path is prefixed
  (or stripped from the beginning) to make the shape of two trees to
  match.</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>recursive</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This is now a synonym for <b>ort</b>. It was an
  alternative implementation until v2.49.0, but was redirected to mean
  <b>ort</b> in v2.50.0. The previous recursive strategy was the default
  strategy for resolving two heads from Git v0.99.9k until v2.33.0.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>resolve</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This can only resolve two heads (i.e. the current branch
  and another branch you pulled from) using a 3-way merge algorithm. It tries to
  carefully detect criss-cross merge ambiguities. It does not handle
  renames.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>octopus</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This resolves cases with more than two heads, but refuses
  to do a complex merge that needs manual resolution. It is primarily meant to
  be used for bundling topic branch heads together. This is the default merge
  strategy when pulling or merging more than one branch.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>ours</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This resolves any number of heads, but the resulting tree
  of the merge is always that of the current branch head, effectively ignoring
  all changes from all other branches. It is meant to be used to supersede old
  development history of side branches. Note that this is different from the
  <b>-Xours</b> option to the <b>ort</b> merge strategy.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>subtree</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This is a modified <b>ort</b> strategy. When merging
  trees A and B, if B corresponds to a subtree of A, B is first adjusted to
  match the tree structure of A, instead of reading the trees at the same level.
  This adjustment is also done to the common ancestor tree.</div>
<p class="Pp">With the strategies that use 3-way merge (including the default,
    <b>ort</b>), if a change is made on both branches, but later reverted on one
    of the branches, that change will be present in the merged result; some
    people find this behavior confusing. It occurs because only the heads and
    the merge base are considered when performing a merge, not the individual
    commits. The merge algorithm therefore considers the reverted change as no
    change at all, and substitutes the changed version instead.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="CONFIGURATION"><a class="permalink" href="#CONFIGURATION">CONFIGURATION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp"><b>branch.</b><i>&lt;name&gt;</i><b>.mergeOptions</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Sets default options for merging into branch
  <i>&lt;name&gt;</i>. The syntax and supported options are the same as those of
  <b>git</b> <b>merge</b>, but option values containing whitespace characters
  are currently not supported.</div>
<p class="Pp">Everything above this line in this section isn&#x2019;t included
    from the <b>git-config</b>(1) documentation. The content that follows is the
    same as what&#x2019;s found there:</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>merge.conflictStyle</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Specify the style in which conflicted hunks are written
  out to working tree files upon merge. The default is &quot;merge&quot;, which
  shows a &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; conflict marker, changes made by one
  side, a <b>=======</b> marker, changes made by the other side, and then a
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; marker. An alternate style, &quot;diff3&quot;,
  adds a ||||||| marker and the original text before the <b>=======</b> marker.
  The &quot;merge&quot; style tends to produce smaller conflict regions than
  diff3, both because of the exclusion of the original text, and because when a
  subset of lines match on the two sides, they are just pulled out of the
  conflict region. Another alternate style, &quot;zdiff3&quot;, is similar to
  diff3 but removes matching lines on the two sides from the conflict region
  when those matching lines appear near either the beginning or end of a
  conflict region.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>merge.defaultToUpstream</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If merge is called without any commit argument, merge the
  upstream branches configured for the current branch by using their last
  observed values stored in their remote-tracking branches. The values of the
  <b>branch.</b>&lt;current <b>branch</b>&gt;<b>.merge</b> that name the
  branches at the remote named by
  <b>branch.</b><i>&lt;current-branch&gt;</i><b>.remote</b> are consulted, and
  then they are mapped via <b>remote.</b><i>&lt;remote&gt;</i><b>.fetch</b> to
  their corresponding remote-tracking branches, and the tips of these tracking
  branches are merged. Defaults to true.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>merge.ff</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">By default, Git does not create an extra merge commit
  when merging a commit that is a descendant of the current commit. Instead, the
  tip of the current branch is fast-forwarded. When set to <b>false</b>, this
  variable tells Git to create an extra merge commit in such a case (equivalent
  to giving the <b>--no-ff</b> option from the command line). When set to
  <b>only</b>, only such fast-forward merges are allowed (equivalent to giving
  the <b>--ff-only</b> option from the command line).</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>merge.verifySignatures</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If true, this is equivalent to the
  <b>--verify-signatures</b> command line option. See <b>git-merge</b>(1) for
  details.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>merge.branchdesc</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">In addition to branch names, populate the log message
  with the branch description text associated with them. Defaults to
  false.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>merge.log</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">In addition to branch names, populate the log message
  with at most the specified number of one-line descriptions from the actual
  commits that are being merged. Defaults to false, and true is a synonym for
  20.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>merge.suppressDest</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">By adding a glob that matches the names of integration
  branches to this multi-valued configuration variable, the default merge
  message computed for merges into these integration branches will omit
  &quot;into <i>&lt;branch-name&gt;</i>&quot; from its title.
<p class="Pp">An element with an empty value can be used to clear the list of
    globs accumulated from previous configuration entries. When there is no
    <b>merge.suppressDest</b> variable defined, the default value of
    <b>master</b> is used for backward compatibility.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>merge.renameLimit</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The number of files to consider in the exhaustive portion
  of rename detection during a merge. If not specified, defaults to the value of
  <b>diff.renameLimit</b>. If neither <b>merge.renameLimit</b> nor
  <b>diff.renameLimit</b> are specified, currently defaults to 7000. This
  setting has no effect if rename detection is turned off.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>merge.renames</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Whether Git detects renames. If set to <b>false</b>,
  rename detection is disabled. If set to <b>true</b>, basic rename detection is
  enabled. Defaults to the value of diff.renames.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>merge.directoryRenames</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Whether Git detects directory renames, affecting what
  happens at merge time to new files added to a directory on one side of history
  when that directory was renamed on the other side of history. Possible values
  are:
<p class="Pp"><b>false</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Directory rename detection is disabled, meaning that such
  new files will be left behind in the old directory.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>true</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Directory rename detection is enabled, meaning that such
  new files will be moved into the new directory.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>conflict</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A conflict will be reported for such paths.</div>
<p class="Pp">If <b>merge.renames</b> is <b>false</b>,
    <b>merge.directoryRenames</b> is ignored and treated as <b>false</b>.
    Defaults to <b>conflict</b>.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>merge.renormalize</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Tell Git that canonical representation of files in the
  repository has changed over time (e.g. earlier commits record text files with
  <i>CRLF</i> line endings, but recent ones use <i>LF</i> line endings). In such
  a repository, for each file where a three-way content merge is needed, Git can
  convert the data recorded in commits to a canonical form before performing a
  merge to reduce unnecessary conflicts. For more information, see section
  &quot;Merging branches with differing checkin/checkout attributes&quot; in
  <b>gitattributes</b>(5).</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>merge.stat</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">What, if anything, to print between <b>ORIG_HEAD</b> and
  the merge result at the end of the merge. Possible values are:
<p class="Pp"><b>false</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show nothing.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>true</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show <b>git</b> <b>diff</b> <b>--diffstat</b>

<p class="Pp"><b>compact</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show <b>git</b> <b>diff</b> <b>--compact-summary</b>
  <b>ORIG_HEAD</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">but any unrecognised value (e.g., a value added by a future
    version of Git) is taken as <b>true</b> instead of triggering an error.
    Defaults to <b>true</b>.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>merge.autoStash</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When set to <b>true</b>, automatically create a temporary
  stash entry before the operation begins, and apply it after the operation
  ends. This means that you can run merge on a dirty worktree. However, use with
  care: the final stash application after a successful merge might result in
  non-trivial conflicts. This option can be overridden by the
  <b>--no-autostash</b> and <b>--autostash</b> options of <b>git-merge</b>(1).
  Defaults to <b>false</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>merge.tool</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Controls which merge tool is used by
  <b>git-mergetool</b>(1). The list below shows the valid built-in values. Any
