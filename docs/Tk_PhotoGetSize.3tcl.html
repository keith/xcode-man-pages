   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>Tk_FindPhoto</b> returns an opaque handle that is used to identify a
  particular photo image to the other procedures. The parameter is the name of
  the image, that is, the name specified to the <b>image create</b> <b>photo</b>
  command, or assigned by that command if no name was specified.
<p class="Pp"><b>Tk_PhotoPutBlock</b> is used to supply blocks of image data to
    be displayed. The call affects an area of the image of size <i>width</i> x
    <i>height</i> pixels, with its top-left corner at coordinates
    (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>). All of <i>width</i>, <i>height</i>, <i>x</i>, and
    <i>y</i> must be non-negative. If part of this area lies outside the current
    bounds of the image, the image will be expanded to include the area, unless
    the user has specified an explicit image size with the <b>-width</b> and/or
    <b>-height</b> widget configuration options (see photo(n)); in that case the
    area is silently clipped to the image boundaries.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>block</i> parameter is a pointer to a
    <b>Tk_PhotoImageBlock</b> structure, defined as follows:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
typedef struct {
    unsigned char *<i>pixelPtr</i>;
    int <i>width</i>;
    int <i>height</i>;
    int <i>pitch</i>;
    int <i>pixelSize</i>;
    int <i>offset[4]</i>;
} Tk_PhotoImageBlock;
</pre>
</div>
The <i>pixelPtr</i> field points to the first pixel, that is, the top-left pixel
  in the block. The <i>width</i> and <i>height</i> fields specify the dimensions
  of the block of pixels. The <i>pixelSize</i> field specifies the address
  difference between two horizontally adjacent pixels. Often it is 3 or 4, but
  it can have any value. The <i>pitch</i> field specifies the address difference
  between two vertically adjacent pixels. The <i>offset</i> array contains the
  offsets from the address of a pixel to the addresses of the bytes containing
  the red, green, blue and alpha (transparency) components. These are normally
  0, 1, 2 and 3, but can have other values, e.g., for images that are stored as
  separate red, green and blue planes.
<p class="Pp">The <i>compRule</i> parameter to <b>Tk_PhotoPutBlock</b> specifies
    a compositing rule that says what to do with transparent pixels. The value
    <b>TK_PHOTO_COMPOSITE_OVERLAY</b> says that the previous contents of the
    photo image should show through, and the value <b>TK_PHOTO_COMPOSITE_SET</b>
    says that the previous contents of the photo image should be completely
    ignored, and the values from the block be copied directly across. The
    behavior in Tk8.3 and earlier was equivalent to having
    <b>TK_PHOTO_COMPOSITE_OVERLAY</b> as a compositing rule.</p>
<p class="Pp">The value given for the <i>width</i> and <i>height</i> parameters
    to <b>Tk_PhotoPutBlock</b> do not have to correspond to the values specified
    in <i>block</i>. If they are smaller, <b>Tk_PhotoPutBlock</b> extracts a
    sub-block from the image data supplied. If they are larger, the data given
    are replicated (in a tiled fashion) to fill the specified area. These rules
    operate independently in the horizontal and vertical directions.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tk_PhotoPutBlock</b> normally returns <b>TCL_OK</b>, though if
    it cannot allocate sufficient memory to hold the resulting image,
    <b>TCL_ERROR</b> is returned instead and, if the <i>interp</i> argument is
    non-NULL, an error message is placed in the interpreter's result.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tk_PhotoPutZoomedBlock</b> works like <b>Tk_PhotoPutBlock</b>
    except that the image can be reduced or enlarged for display. The
    <i>subsampleX</i> and <i>subsampleY</i> parameters allow the size of the
    image to be reduced by subsampling. <b>Tk_PhotoPutZoomedBlock</b> will use
    only pixels from the input image whose X coordinates are multiples of
    <i>subsampleX</i>, and whose Y coordinates are multiples of
    <i>subsampleY</i>. For example, an image of 512x512 pixels can be reduced to
    256x256 by setting <i>subsampleX</i> and <i>subsampleY</i> to 2.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>zoomX</i> and <i>zoomY</i> parameters allow the image to be
    enlarged by pixel replication. Each pixel of the (possibly subsampled) input
    image will be written to a block <i>zoomX</i> pixels wide and <i>zoomY</i>
    pixels high of the displayed image. Subsampling and zooming can be used
    together for special effects.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tk_PhotoGetImage</b> can be used to retrieve image data from a
    photo image. <b>Tk_PhotoGetImage</b> fills in the structure pointed to by
    the <i>blockPtr</i> parameter with values that describe the address and
    layout of the image data that the photo image has stored internally. The
    values are valid until the image is destroyed or its size is changed.
    <b>Tk_PhotoGetImage</b> returns 1 for compatibility with the corresponding
    procedure in the old photo widget.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tk_PhotoBlank</b> blanks the entire area of the photo image.
    Blank areas of a photo image are transparent.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tk_PhotoExpand</b> requests that the widget's image be expanded
    to be at least <i>width</i> x <i>height</i> pixels in size. The width and/or
    height are unchanged if the user has specified an explicit image width or
    height with the <b>-width</b> and/or <b>-height</b> configuration options,
    respectively. If the image data are being supplied in many small blocks, it
    is more efficient to use <b>Tk_PhotoExpand</b> or <b>Tk_PhotoSetSize</b> at
    the beginning rather than allowing the image to expand in many small
    increments as image blocks are supplied.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tk_PhotoExpand</b> normally returns <b>TCL_OK</b>, though if it
    cannot allocate sufficient memory to hold the resulting image,
    <b>TCL_ERROR</b> is returned instead and, if the <i>interp</i> argument is
    non-NULL, an error message is placed in the interpreter's result.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tk_PhotoSetSize</b> specifies the size of the image, as if the
    user had specified the given <i>width</i> and <i>height</i> values to the
    <b>-width</b> and <b>-height</b> configuration options. A value of zero for
    <i>width</i> or <i>height</i> does not change the image's width or height,
    but allows the width or height to be changed by subsequent calls to
    <b>Tk_PhotoPutBlock</b>, <b>Tk_PhotoPutZoomedBlock</b> or
    <b>Tk_PhotoExpand</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tk_PhotoSetSize</b> normally returns <b>TCL_OK</b>, though if
    it cannot allocate sufficient memory to hold the resulting image,
    <b>TCL_ERROR</b> is returned instead and, if the <i>interp</i> argument is
    non-NULL, an error message is placed in the interpreter's result.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tk_PhotoGetSize</b> returns the dimensions of the image in
    *<i>widthPtr</i> and *<i>heightPtr</i>.</p>

In Tk 8.3 and earlier, <b>Tk_PhotoPutBlock</b> and <b>Tk_PhotoPutZoomedBlock</b>
  had different signatures. If you want to compile code that uses the old
  interface against 8.4 without updating your code, compile it with the flag
  -DUSE_COMPOSITELESS_PHOTO_PUT_BLOCK. Code linked using Stubs against older
  versions of Tk will continue to work.
<p class="Pp">In Tk 8.4, <b>Tk_PhotoPutBlock</b>, <b>Tk_PhotoPutZoomedBlock</b>,
    <b>Tk_PhotoExpand</b> and <b>Tk_PhotoSetSize</b> did not take an
    <i>interp</i> argument or return any result code. If insufficient memory was
    available for an image, Tk would panic. This behaviour is still supported if
    you compile your extension with the additional flag
    -DUSE_PANIC_ON_PHOTO_ALLOC_FAILURE. Code linked using Stubs against older
    versions of Tk will continue to work.</p>
