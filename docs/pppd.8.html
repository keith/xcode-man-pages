PPP is the protocol used for establishing internet links over dial-up modems,
  DSL connections, and many other types of point-to-point links. The <i>pppd</i>
  daemon works together with the kernel PPP driver to establish and maintain a
  PPP link with another system (called the <i>peer</i>) and to negotiate
  Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for each end of the link. Pppd can also
  authenticate the peer and/or supply authentication information to the peer.
  PPP can be used with other network protocols besides IP, but such use is
  becoming increasingly rare.

<h1 class="Sh" id="FREQUENTLY_USED_OPTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#FREQUENTLY_USED_OPTIONS">FREQUENTLY
  USED OPTIONS</a></h1>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><i>ttyname</i></dt>
  <dd>Use the serial port called <i>ttyname</i> to communicate with the peer.
      The string &quot;/dev/&quot; is prepended to <i>ttyname</i> to form the
      name of the device to open. If no device name is given, or if the name of
      the terminal connected to the standard input is given, pppd will use that
      terminal, and will not fork to put itself in the background. A value for
      this option from a privileged source cannot be overridden by a
      non-privileged user.</dd>
  <dt><i>speed</i></dt>
  <dd>An option that is a decimal number is taken as the desired baud rate for
      the serial device. On systems such as 4.4BSD and NetBSD, any speed can be
      specified. Other systems (e.g. Linux, SunOS) only support the
      commonly-used baud rates.</dd>
  <dt><b>asyncmap <i>map</i></b></dt>
  <dd>This option sets the Async-Control-Character-Map (ACCM) for this end of
      the link. The ACCM is a set of 32 bits, one for each of the ASCII control
      characters with values from 0 to 31, where a 1 bit indicates that the
      corresponding control character should not be used in PPP packets sent to
      this system. The map is encoded as a hexadecimal number (without a leading
      0x) where the least significant bit (00000001) represents character 0 and
      the most significant bit (80000000) represents character 31. Pppd will ask
      the peer to send these characters as a 2-byte escape sequence. If multiple
      <i>asyncmap</i> options are given, the values are ORed together. If no
      <i>asyncmap</i> option is given, the default is zero, so pppd will ask the
      peer not to escape any control characters. To escape transmitted
      characters, use the <i>escape</i> option.</dd>
  <dt><b>auth</b></dt>
  <dd>Require the peer to authenticate itself before allowing network packets to
      be sent or received. This option is the default if the system has a
      default route. If neither this option nor the <i>noauth</i> option is
      specified, pppd will only allow the peer to use IP addresses to which the
      system does not already have a route.</dd>
  <dt><b>call <i>name</i></b></dt>
  <dd>Read options from the file /etc/ppp/peers/<i>name</i>. This file may
      contain privileged options, such as <i>noauth</i>, even if pppd is not
      being run by root. The <i>name</i> string may not begin with / or include
      .. as a pathname component. The format of the options file is described
      below.</dd>
  <dt><b>connect <i>script</i></b></dt>
  <dd>Usually there is something which needs to be done to prepare the link
      before the PPP protocol can be started; for instance, with a dial-up
      modem, commands need to be sent to the modem to dial the appropriate phone
      number. This option specifies an command for pppd to execute (by passing
      it to a shell) before attempting to start PPP negotiation. The chat (8)
      program is often useful here, as it provides a way to send arbitrary
      strings to a modem and respond to received characters. A value for this
      option from a privileged source cannot be overridden by a non-privileged
      user.</dd>
  <dt><b>crtscts</b></dt>
  <dd>Specifies that pppd should set the serial port to use hardware flow
      control using the RTS and CTS signals in the RS-232 interface. If neither
      the <i>crtscts</i>, the <i>nocrtscts</i>, the <i>cdtrcts</i> nor the
      <i>nocdtrcts</i> option is given, the hardware flow control setting for
      the serial port is left unchanged. Some serial ports (such as Macintosh
      serial ports) lack a true RTS output. Such serial ports use this mode to
      implement unidirectional flow control. The serial port will suspend
      transmission when requested by the modem (via CTS) but will be unable to
      request the modem to stop sending to the computer. This mode retains the
      ability to use DTR as a modem control line.</dd>
  <dt><b>defaultroute</b></dt>
  <dd>Add a default route to the system routing tables, using the peer as the
      gateway, when IPCP negotiation is successfully completed. This entry is
      removed when the PPP connection is broken. This option is privileged if
      the <i>nodefaultroute</i> option has been specified.</dd>
  <dt><b>disconnect <i>script</i></b></dt>
  <dd>Execute the command specified by <i>script</i>, by passing it to a shell,
      after pppd has terminated the link. This command could, for example, issue
      commands to the modem to cause it to hang up if hardware modem control
      signals were not available. The disconnect script is not run if the modem
      has already hung up. A value for this option from a privileged source
      cannot be overridden by a non-privileged user.</dd>
  <dt><b>escape <i>xx,yy,...</i></b></dt>
  <dd>Specifies that certain characters should be escaped on transmission
      (regardless of whether the peer requests them to be escaped with its async
      control character map). The characters to be escaped are specified as a
      list of hex numbers separated by commas. Note that almost any character
      can be specified for the <i>escape</i> option, unlike the <i>asyncmap</i>
      option which only allows control characters to be specified. The
      characters which may not be escaped are those with hex values 0x20 - 0x3f
      or 0x5e.</dd>
  <dt><b>file <i>name</i></b></dt>
  <dd>Read options from file <i>name</i> (the format is described below). The
      file must be readable by the user who has invoked pppd.</dd>
  <dt><b>init <i>script</i></b></dt>
  <dd>Execute the command specified by <i>script</i>, by passing it to a shell,
      to initialize the serial line. This script would typically use the chat(8)
      program to configure the modem to enable auto answer. A value for this
      option from a privileged source cannot be overridden by a non-privileged
      user.</dd>
  <dt><b>lock</b></dt>
  <dd>Specifies that pppd should create a UUCP-style lock file for the serial
      device to ensure exclusive access to the device.</dd>
  <dt><b>mru <i>n</i></b></dt>
  <dd>Set the MRU [Maximum Receive Unit] value to <i>n</i>. Pppd will ask the
      peer to send packets of no more than <i>n</i> bytes. The value of <i>n</i>
      must be between 128 and 16384; the default is 1500. A value of 296 works
      well on very slow links (40 bytes for TCP/IP header + 256 bytes of data).
      Note that for the IPv6 protocol, the MRU must be at least 1280.</dd>
  <dt><b>mtu <i>n</i></b></dt>
  <dd>Set the MTU [Maximum Transmit Unit] value to <i>n</i>. Unless the peer
      requests a smaller value via MRU negotiation, pppd will request that the
      kernel networking code send data packets of no more than <i>n</i> bytes
      through the PPP network interface. Note that for the IPv6 protocol, the
      MTU must be at least 1280.</dd>
  <dt><b>passive</b></dt>
  <dd>Enables the &quot;passive&quot; option in the LCP. With this option, pppd
      will attempt to initiate a connection; if no reply is received from the
      peer, pppd will then just wait passively for a valid LCP packet from the
      peer, instead of exiting, as it would without this option.</dd>

<h1 class="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><i>&lt;local_IP_address&gt;<b>:</b><i>&lt;remote_IP_address&gt;</i></i></dt>
  <dd>Set the local and/or remote interface IP addresses. Either one may be
      omitted. The IP addresses can be specified with a host name or in decimal
      dot notation (e.g. 150.234.56.78). The default local address is the
      (first) IP address of the system (unless the <i>noipdefault</i> option is
      given). The remote address will be obtained from the peer if not specified
      in any option. Thus, in simple cases, this option is not required. If a
      local and/or remote IP address is specified with this option, pppd will
      not accept a different value from the peer in the IPCP negotiation, unless
      the <i>ipcp-accept-local</i> and/or <i>ipcp-accept-remote</i> options are
      given, respectively.</dd>
  <dt><b>ipv6
    <i>&lt;local_interface_identifier&gt;</i>,<i>&lt;remote_interface_identifier&gt;</i></b></dt>
  <dd>Set the local and/or remote 64-bit interface identifier. Either one may be
      omitted. The identifier must be specified in standard ascii notation of
      IPv6 addresses (e.g. ::dead:beef). If the <i>ipv6cp-use-ipaddr</i> option
      is given, the local identifier is the local IPv4 address (see above). On
      systems which supports a unique persistent id, such as EUI-48 derived from
      the Ethernet MAC address, <i>ipv6cp-use-persistent</i> option can be used
      to replace the <i>ipv6 &lt;local&gt;,&lt;remote&gt;</i> option. Otherwise
      the identifier is randomized.</dd>
  <dt><b>active-filter <i>filter-expression</i></b></dt>
  <dd>Specifies a packet filter to be applied to data packets to determine which
      packets are to be regarded as link activity, and therefore reset the idle
      timer, or cause the link to be brought up in demand-dialing mode. This
      option is useful in conjunction with the <b>idle</b> option if there are
      packets being sent or received regularly over the link (for example,
      routing information packets) which would otherwise prevent the link from
      ever appearing to be idle. The <i>filter-expression</i> syntax is as
      described for tcpdump(1), except that qualifiers which are inappropriate
      for a PPP link, such as <b>ether</b> and <b>arp</b>, are not permitted.
      Generally the filter expression should be enclosed in single-quotes to
      prevent whitespace in the expression from being interpreted by the shell.
      This option is currently only available under Linux, and requires that the
      kernel was configured to include PPP filtering support
      (CONFIG_PPP_FILTER). Note that it is possible to apply different
      constraints to incoming and outgoing packets using the <b>inbound</b> and
      <b>outbound</b> qualifiers.</dd>
  <dt><b>allow-ip <i>address(es)</i></b></dt>
  <dd>Allow peers to use the given IP address or subnet without authenticating
      themselves. The parameter is parsed as for each element of the list of
      allowed IP addresses in the secrets files (see the AUTHENTICATION section
      below).</dd>
  <dt><b>allow-number <i>number</i></b></dt>
  <dd>Allow peers to connect from the given telephone number. A trailing `*'
      character will match all numbers beginning with the leading part.</dd>
  <dt><b>bsdcomp <i>nr,nt</i></b></dt>
  <dd>Request that the peer compress packets that it sends, using the
      BSD-Compress scheme, with a maximum code size of <i>nr</i> bits, and agree
      to compress packets sent to the peer with a maximum code size of <i>nt</i>
      bits. If <i>nt</i> is not specified, it defaults to the value given for
      <i>nr</i>. Values in the range 9 to 15 may be used for <i>nr</i> and
      <i>nt</i>; larger values give better compression but consume more kernel
      memory for compression dictionaries. Alternatively, a value of 0 for
      <i>nr</i> or <i>nt</i> disables compression in the corresponding
      direction. Use <i>nobsdcomp</i> or <i>bsdcomp 0</i> to disable
      BSD-Compress compression entirely.</dd>
  <dt><b>cdtrcts</b></dt>
  <dd>Use a non-standard hardware flow control (i.e. DTR/CTS) to control the
      flow of data on the serial port. If neither the <i>crtscts</i>, the
      <i>nocrtscts</i>, the <i>cdtrcts</i> nor the <i>nocdtrcts</i> option is
      given, the hardware flow control setting for the serial port is left
      unchanged. Some serial ports (such as Macintosh serial ports) lack a true
      RTS output. Such serial ports use this mode to implement true
      bi-directional flow control. The sacrifice is that this flow control mode
      does not permit using DTR as a modem control line.</dd>
  <dt><b>chap-interval <i>n</i></b></dt>
  <dd>If this option is given, pppd will rechallenge the peer every <i>n</i>
      seconds.</dd>
  <dt><b>chap-max-challenge <i>n</i></b></dt>
  <dd>Set the maximum number of CHAP challenge transmissions to <i>n</i>
      (default 10).</dd>
  <dt><b>chap-restart <i>n</i></b></dt>
  <dd>Set the CHAP restart interval (retransmission timeout for challenges) to
      <i>n</i> seconds (default 3).</dd>
  <dt><b>connect-delay <i>n</i></b></dt>
  <dd>Wait for up <i>n</i> milliseconds after the connect script finishes for a
      valid PPP packet from the peer. At the end of this time, or when a valid
      PPP packet is received from the peer, pppd will commence negotiation by
      sending its first LCP packet. The default value is 1000 (1 second). This
      wait period only applies if the <b>connect</b> or <b>pty</b> option is
      used.</dd>
  <dt><b>debug</b></dt>
  <dd>Enables connection debugging facilities. If this option is given, pppd
      will log the contents of all control packets sent or received in a
      readable form. The packets are logged through syslog with facility
      <i>daemon</i> and level <i>debug</i>. This information can be directed to
      a file by setting up /etc/syslog.conf appropriately (see
    syslog.conf(5)).</dd>
  <dt><b>default-asyncmap</b></dt>
  <dd>Disable asyncmap negotiation, forcing all control characters to be escaped
      for both the transmit and the receive direction.</dd>
  <dt><b>default-mru</b></dt>
  <dd>Disable MRU [Maximum Receive Unit] negotiation. With this option, pppd
      will use the default MRU value of 1500 bytes for both the transmit and
      receive direction.</dd>
  <dt><b>deflate <i>nr,nt</i></b></dt>
  <dd>Request that the peer compress packets that it sends, using the Deflate
      scheme, with a maximum window size of <i>2**nr</i> bytes, and agree to
      compress packets sent to the peer with a maximum window size of
      <i>2**nt</i> bytes. If <i>nt</i> is not specified, it defaults to the
      value given for <i>nr</i>. Values in the range 9 to 15 may be used for
      <i>nr</i> and <i>nt</i>; larger values give better compression but consume
      more kernel memory for compression dictionaries. Alternatively, a value of
      0 for <i>nr</i> or <i>nt</i> disables compression in the corresponding
      direction. Use <i>nodeflate</i> or <i>deflate 0</i> to disable Deflate
      compression entirely. (Note: pppd requests Deflate compression in
      preference to BSD-Compress if the peer can do either.)</dd>
  <dt><b>demand</b></dt>
  <dd>Initiate the link only on demand, i.e. when data traffic is present. With
      this option, the remote IP address must be specified by the user on the
      command line or in an options file. Pppd will initially configure the
      interface and enable it for IP traffic without connecting to the peer.
      When traffic is available, pppd will connect to the peer and perform
      negotiation, authentication, etc. When this is completed, pppd will
      commence passing data packets (i.e., IP packets) across the link.
    <p class="Pp">The <i>demand</i> option implies the <i>persist</i> option. If
        this behaviour is not desired, use the <i>nopersist</i> option after the
        <i>demand</i> option. The <i>idle</i> and <i>holdoff</i> options are
        also useful in conjuction with the <i>demand</i> option.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>domain <i>d</i></b></dt>
  <dd>Append the domain name <i>d</i> to the local host name for authentication
      purposes. For example, if gethostname() returns the name porsche, but the
      fully qualified domain name is porsche.Quotron.COM, you could specify
      <i>domain Quotron.COM</i>. Pppd would then use the name
      <i>porsche.Quotron.COM</i> for looking up secrets in the secrets file, and
      as the default name to send to the peer when authenticating itself to the
      peer. This option is privileged.</dd>
  <dt><b>dryrun</b></dt>
  <dd>With the <b>dryrun</b> option, pppd will print out all the option values
      which have been set and then exit, after parsing the command line and
      options files and checking the option values, but before initiating the
      link. The option values are logged at level info, and also printed to
      standard output unless the device on standard output is the device that
      pppd would be using to communicate with the peer.</dd>
  <dt><b>dump</b></dt>
  <dd>With the <b>dump</b> option, pppd will print out all the option values
      which have been set. This option is like the <b>dryrun</b> option except
      that pppd proceeds as normal rather than exiting.</dd>
  <dt><b>endpoint <i>&lt;epdisc&gt;</i></b></dt>
  <dd>Sets the endpoint discriminator sent by the local machine to the peer
      during multilink negotiation to <i>&lt;epdisc&gt;</i>. The default is to
      use the MAC address of the first ethernet interface on the system, if any,
      otherwise the IPv4 address corresponding to the hostname, if any, provided
      it is not in the multicast or locally-assigned IP address ranges, or the
      localhost address. The endpoint discriminator can be the string
      <b>null</b> or of the form <i>type</i>:<i>value</i>, where type is a
      decimal number or one of the strings <b>local</b>, <b>IP</b>, <b>MAC</b>,
      <b>magic</b>, or <b>phone</b>. The value is an IP address in
      dotted-decimal notation for the <b>IP</b> type, or a string of bytes in
      hexadecimal, separated by periods or colons for the other types. For the
      MAC type, the value may also be the name of an ethernet or similar network
      interface. This option is currently only available under Linux.</dd>
  <dt><b>hide-password</b></dt>
  <dd>When logging the contents of PAP packets, this option causes pppd to
      exclude the password string from the log. This is the default.</dd>
  <dt><b>holdoff <i>n</i></b></dt>
  <dd>Specifies how many seconds to wait before re-initiating the link after it
      terminates. This option only has any effect if the <i>persist</i> or
      <i>demand</i> option is used. The holdoff period is not applied if the
      link was terminated because it was idle.</dd>
  <dt><b>idle <i>n</i></b></dt>
  <dd>Specifies that pppd should disconnect if the link is idle for <i>n</i>
      seconds. The link is idle when no data packets (i.e. IP packets) are being
      sent or received. Note: it is not advisable to use this option with the
      <i>persist</i> option without the <i>demand</i> option. If the
      <b>active-filter</b> option is given, data packets which are rejected by
      the specified activity filter also count as the link being idle.</dd>
  <dt><b>ipcp-accept-local</b></dt>
  <dd>With this option, pppd will accept the peer's idea of our local IP
      address, even if the local IP address was specified in an option.</dd>
  <dt><b>ipcp-accept-remote</b></dt>
  <dd>With this option, pppd will accept the peer's idea of its (remote) IP
      address, even if the remote IP address was specified in an option.</dd>
  <dt><b>ipcp-max-configure <i>n</i></b></dt>
  <dd>Set the maximum number of IPCP configure-request transmissions to <i>n</i>
      (default 10).</dd>
  <dt><b>ipcp-max-failure <i>n</i></b></dt>
  <dd>Set the maximum number of IPCP configure-NAKs returned before starting to
      send configure-Rejects instead to <i>n</i> (default 10).</dd>
  <dt><b>ipcp-max-terminate <i>n</i></b></dt>
  <dd>Set the maximum number of IPCP terminate-request transmissions to <i>n</i>
      (default 3).</dd>
  <dt><b>ipcp-restart <i>n</i></b></dt>
  <dd>Set the IPCP restart interval (retransmission timeout) to <i>n</i> seconds
      (default 3).</dd>
  <dt><b>ipparam <i>string</i></b></dt>
  <dd>Provides an extra parameter to the ip-up and ip-down scripts. If this
      option is given, the <i>string</i> supplied is given as the 6th parameter
      to those scripts.</dd>
  <dt><b>ipv6cp-max-configure <i>n</i></b></dt>
  <dd>Set the maximum number of IPv6CP configure-request transmissions to
      <i>n</i> (default 10).</dd>
  <dt><b>ipv6cp-max-failure <i>n</i></b></dt>
  <dd>Set the maximum number of IPv6CP configure-NAKs returned before starting
      to send configure-Rejects instead to <i>n</i> (default 10).</dd>
  <dt><b>ipv6cp-max-terminate <i>n</i></b></dt>
  <dd>Set the maximum number of IPv6CP terminate-request transmissions to
      <i>n</i> (default 3).</dd>
  <dt><b>ipv6cp-restart <i>n</i></b></dt>
  <dd>Set the IPv6CP restart interval (retransmission timeout) to <i>n</i>
      seconds (default 3).</dd>
  <dt><b>ipx</b></dt>
  <dd>Enable the IPXCP and IPX protocols. This option is presently only
      supported under Linux, and only if your kernel has been configured to
      include IPX support.</dd>
  <dt><b>ipx-network <i>n</i></b></dt>
  <dd>Set the IPX network number in the IPXCP configure request frame to
      <i>n</i>, a hexadecimal number (without a leading 0x). There is no valid
      default. If this option is not specified, the network number is obtained
      from the peer. If the peer does not have the network number, the IPX
      protocol will not be started.</dd>
  <dt><b>ipx-node <i>n</i><b>:</b><i>m</i></b></dt>
  <dd>Set the IPX node numbers. The two node numbers are separated from each
      other with a colon character. The first number <i>n</i> is the local node
      number. The second number <i>m</i> is the peer's node number. Each node
      number is a hexadecimal number, at most 10 digits long. The node numbers
      on the ipx-network must be unique. There is no valid default. If this
      option is not specified then the node numbers are obtained from the
    peer.</dd>
  <dt><b>ipx-router-name <i>&lt;string&gt;</i></b></dt>
  <dd>Set the name of the router. This is a string and is sent to the peer as
      information data.</dd>
  <dt><b>ipx-routing <i>n</i></b></dt>
  <dd>Set the routing protocol to be received by this option. More than one
      instance of <i>ipx-routing</i> may be specified. The '<i>none</i>' option
      (0) may be specified as the only instance of ipx-routing. The values may
      be <i>0</i> for <i>NONE</i>, <i>2</i> for <i>RIP/SAP</i>, and <i>4</i> for
      <i>NLSP</i>.</dd>
  <dt><b>ipxcp-accept-local</b></dt>
  <dd>Accept the peer's NAK for the node number specified in the ipx-node
      option. If a node number was specified, and non-zero, the default is to
      insist that the value be used. If you include this option then you will
      permit the peer to override the entry of the node number.</dd>
  <dt><b>ipxcp-accept-network</b></dt>
  <dd>Accept the peer's NAK for the network number specified in the ipx-network
      option. If a network number was specified, and non-zero, the default is to
      insist that the value be used. If you include this option then you will
      permit the peer to override the entry of the node number.</dd>
  <dt><b>ipxcp-accept-remote</b></dt>
  <dd>Use the peer's network number specified in the configure request frame. If
      a node number was specified for the peer and this option was not
      specified, the peer will be forced to use the value which you have
      specified.</dd>
  <dt><b>ipxcp-max-configure <i>n</i></b></dt>
  <dd>Set the maximum number of IPXCP configure request frames which the system
      will send to <i>n</i>. The default is 10.</dd>
  <dt><b>ipxcp-max-failure <i>n</i></b></dt>
  <dd>Set the maximum number of IPXCP NAK frames which the local system will
      send before it rejects the options. The default value is 3.</dd>
  <dt><b>ipxcp-max-terminate <i>n</i></b></dt>
  <dd>Set the maximum nuber of IPXCP terminate request frames before the local
      system considers that the peer is not listening to them. The default value
      is 3.</dd>
  <dt><b>kdebug <i>n</i></b></dt>
  <dd>Enable debugging code in the kernel-level PPP driver. The argument values
      depend on the specific kernel driver, but in general a value of 1 will
      enable general kernel debug messages. (Note that these messages are
      usually only useful for debugging the kernel driver itself.) For the Linux
      2.2.x kernel driver, the value is a sum of bits: 1 to enable general debug
      messages, 2 to request that the contents of received packets be printed,
      and 4 to request that the contents of transmitted packets be printed. On
      most systems, messages printed by the kernel are logged by syslog(1) to a
      file as directed in the /etc/syslog.conf configuration file.</dd>
  <dt><b>ktune</b></dt>
  <dd>Enables pppd to alter kernel settings as appropriate. Under Linux, pppd
      will enable IP forwarding (i.e. set /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward to 1) if
      the <i>proxyarp</i> option is used, and will enable the dynamic IP address
      option (i.e. set /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_dynaddr to 1) in demand mode if the
      local address changes.</dd>
  <dt><b>lcp-echo-failure <i>n</i></b></dt>
  <dd>If this option is given, pppd will presume the peer to be dead if <i>n</i>
      LCP echo-requests are sent without receiving a valid LCP echo-reply. If
      this happens, pppd will terminate the connection. Use of this option
      requires a non-zero value for the <i>lcp-echo-interval</i> parameter. This
      option can be used to enable pppd to terminate after the physical
      connection has been broken (e.g., the modem has hung up) in situations
      where no hardware modem control lines are available.</dd>
  <dt><b>lcp-echo-interval <i>n</i></b></dt>
  <dd>If this option is given, pppd will send an LCP echo-request frame to the
      peer every <i>n</i> seconds. Normally the peer should respond to the
      echo-request by sending an echo-reply. This option can be used with the
      <i>lcp-echo-failure</i> option to detect that the peer is no longer
      connected.</dd>
  <dt><b>lcp-max-configure <i>n</i></b></dt>
  <dd>Set the maximum number of LCP configure-request transmissions to <i>n</i>
      (default 10).</dd>
  <dt><b>lcp-max-failure <i>n</i></b></dt>
  <dd>Set the maximum number of LCP configure-NAKs returned before starting to
      send configure-Rejects instead to <i>n</i> (default 10).</dd>
  <dt><b>lcp-max-terminate <i>n</i></b></dt>
  <dd>Set the maximum number of LCP terminate-request transmissions to <i>n</i>
      (default 3).</dd>
  <dt><b>lcp-restart <i>n</i></b></dt>
  <dd>Set the LCP restart interval (retransmission timeout) to <i>n</i> seconds
      (default 3).</dd>
  <dt><b>linkname <i>name</i></b></dt>
  <dd>Sets the logical name of the link to <i>name</i>. Pppd will create a file
      named <b>ppp-</b><i>name</i><b>.pid</b> in /var/run (or /etc/ppp on some
      systems) containing its process ID. This can be useful in determining
      which instance of pppd is responsible for the link to a given peer system.
      This is a privileged option.</dd>
  <dt><b>local</b></dt>
  <dd>Don't use the modem control lines. With this option, pppd will ignore the
      state of the CD (Carrier Detect) signal from the modem and will not change
      the state of the DTR (Data Terminal Ready) signal.</dd>
  <dt><b>logfd <i>n</i></b></dt>
  <dd>Send log messages to file descriptor <i>n</i>. Pppd will send log messages
      to at most one file or file descriptor (as well as sending the log
      messages to syslog), so this option and the <b>logfile</b> option are
      mutually exclusive. The default is for pppd to send log messages to stdout
      (file descriptor 1), unless the serial port is already open on
    stdout.</dd>
  <dt><b>logfile <i>filename</i></b></dt>
  <dd>Append log messages to the file <i>filename</i> (as well as sending the
      log messages to syslog). The file is opened with the privileges of the
      user who invoked pppd, in append mode.</dd>
  <dt><b>login</b></dt>
  <dd>Use the system password database for authenticating the peer using PAP,
      and record the user in the system wtmp file. Note that the peer must have
      an entry in the /etc/ppp/pap-secrets file as well as the system password
      database to be allowed access.</dd>
  <dt><b>maxconnect <i>n</i></b></dt>
  <dd>Terminate the connection when it has been available for network traffic
      for <i>n</i> seconds (i.e. <i>n</i> seconds after the first network
      control protocol comes up).</dd>
  <dt><b>maxfail <i>n</i></b></dt>
  <dd>Terminate after <i>n</i> consecutive failed connection attempts. A value
      of 0 means no limit. The default value is 10.</dd>
  <dt><b>modem</b></dt>
  <dd>Use the modem control lines. This option is the default. With this option,
      pppd will wait for the CD (Carrier Detect) signal from the modem to be
      asserted when opening the serial device (unless a connect script is
      specified), and it will drop the DTR (Data Terminal Ready) signal briefly
      when the connection is terminated and before executing the connect script.
      On Ultrix, this option implies hardware flow control, as for the
      <i>crtscts</i> option.</dd>
  <dt><b>mp</b></dt>
  <dd>Enables the use of PPP multilink; this is an alias for the `multilink'
      option. This option is currently only available under Linux.</dd>
  <dt><b>mppe-stateful</b></dt>
  <dd>Allow MPPE to use stateful mode. Stateless mode is still attempted first.
      The default is to disallow stateful mode.</dd>
  <dt><b>mpshortseq</b></dt>
  <dd>Enables the use of short (12-bit) sequence numbers in multilink headers,
      as opposed to 24-bit sequence numbers. This option is only available under
      Linux, and only has any effect if multilink is enabled (see the multilink
      option).</dd>
  <dt><b>mrru <i>n</i></b></dt>
  <dd>Sets the Maximum Reconstructed Receive Unit to <i>n</i>. The MRRU is the
      maximum size for a received packet on a multilink bundle, and is analogous
      to the MRU for the individual links. This option is currently only
      available under Linux, and only has any effect if multilink is enabled
      (see the multilink option).</dd>
  <dt><b>ms-dns <i>&lt;addr&gt;</i></b></dt>
  <dd>If pppd is acting as a server for Microsoft Windows clients, this option
      allows pppd to supply one or two DNS (Domain Name Server) addresses to the
      clients. The first instance of this option specifies the primary DNS
      address; the second instance (if given) specifies the secondary DNS
      address. (This option was present in some older versions of pppd under the
      name <b>dns-addr</b>.)</dd>
  <dt><b>ms-wins <i>&lt;addr&gt;</i></b></dt>
  <dd>If pppd is acting as a server for Microsoft Windows or &quot;Samba&quot;
      clients, this option allows pppd to supply one or two WINS (Windows
      Internet Name Services) server addresses to the clients. The first
      instance of this option specifies the primary WINS address; the second
      instance (if given) specifies the secondary WINS address.</dd>
  <dt><b>multilink</b></dt>
  <dd>Enables the use of the PPP multilink protocol. If the peer also supports
      multilink, then this link can become part of a bundle between the local
      system and the peer. If there is an existing bundle to the peer, pppd will
      join this link to that bundle, otherwise pppd will create a new bundle.
      See the MULTILINK section below. This option is currently only available
      under Linux.</dd>
  <dt><b>name <i>name</i></b></dt>
  <dd>Set the name of the local system for authentication purposes to
      <i>name</i>. This is a privileged option. With this option, pppd will use
      lines in the secrets files which have <i>name</i> as the second field when
      looking for a secret to use in authenticating the peer. In addition,
      unless overridden with the <i>user</i> option, <i>name</i> will be used as
      the name to send to the peer when authenticating the local system to the
      peer. (Note that pppd does not append the domain name to
    <i>name</i>.)</dd>
  <dt><b>noaccomp</b></dt>
  <dd>Disable Address/Control compression in both directions (send and
    receive).</dd>
  <dt><b>noauth</b></dt>
  <dd>Do not require the peer to authenticate itself. This option is
    privileged.</dd>
  <dt><b>nobsdcomp</b></dt>
  <dd>Disables BSD-Compress compression; <b>pppd</b> will not request or agree
      to compress packets using the BSD-Compress scheme.</dd>
  <dt><b>noccp</b></dt>
  <dd>Disable CCP (Compression Control Protocol) negotiation. This option should
      only be required if the peer is buggy and gets confused by requests from
      pppd for CCP negotiation.</dd>
  <dt><b>nocrtscts</b></dt>
  <dd>Disable hardware flow control (i.e. RTS/CTS) on the serial port. If
      neither the <i>crtscts</i> nor the <i>nocrtscts</i> nor the <i>cdtrcts</i>
      nor the <i>nocdtrcts</i> option is given, the hardware flow control
      setting for the serial port is left unchanged.</dd>
  <dt><b>nocdtrcts</b></dt>
  <dd>This option is a synonym for <i>nocrtscts</i>. Either of these options
      will disable both forms of hardware flow control.</dd>
  <dt><b>nodefaultroute</b></dt>
  <dd>Disable the <i>defaultroute</i> option. The system administrator who
      wishes to prevent users from creating default routes with pppd can do so
      by placing this option in the /etc/ppp/options file.</dd>
  <dt><b>nodeflate</b></dt>
  <dd>Disables Deflate compression; pppd will not request or agree to compress
      packets using the Deflate scheme.</dd>
  <dt><b>nodetach</b></dt>
  <dd>Don't detach from the controlling terminal. Without this option, if a
      serial device other than the terminal on the standard input is specified,
      pppd will fork to become a background process.</dd>
  <dt><b>noendpoint</b></dt>
  <dd>Disables pppd from sending an endpoint discriminator to the peer or
      accepting one from the peer (see the MULTILINK section below). This option
      should only be required if the peer is buggy.</dd>
  <dt><b>noip</b></dt>
  <dd>Disable IPCP negotiation and IP communication. This option should only be
      required if the peer is buggy and gets confused by requests from pppd for
      IPCP negotiation.</dd>
  <dt><b>noipv6</b></dt>
  <dd>Disable IPv6CP negotiation and IPv6 communication. This option should only
      be required if the peer is buggy and gets confused by requests from pppd
      for IPv6CP negotiation.</dd>
  <dt><b>noipdefault</b></dt>
  <dd>Disables the default behaviour when no local IP address is specified,
      which is to determine (if possible) the local IP address from the
      hostname. With this option, the peer will have to supply the local IP
      address during IPCP negotiation (unless it specified explicitly on the
      command line or in an options file).</dd>
  <dt><b>noipx</b></dt>
  <dd>Disable the IPXCP and IPX protocols. This option should only be required
      if the peer is buggy and gets confused by requests from pppd for IPXCP
      negotiation.</dd>
  <dt><b>noktune</b></dt>
  <dd>Opposite of the <i>ktune</i> option; disables pppd from changing system
      settings.</dd>
  <dt><b>nolog</b></dt>
  <dd>Do not send log messages to a file or file descriptor. This option cancels
      the <b>logfd</b> and <b>logfile</b> options.</dd>
  <dt><b>nomagic</b></dt>
  <dd>Disable magic number negotiation. With this option, pppd cannot detect a
      looped-back line. This option should only be needed if the peer is
    buggy.</dd>
  <dt><b>nomp</b></dt>
  <dd>Disables the use of PPP multilink. This option is currently only available
      under Linux.</dd>
  <dt><b>nomppe</b></dt>
  <dd>Disables MPPE (Microsoft Point to Point Encryption). This is the
    default.</dd>
  <dt><b>nomppe-40</b></dt>
  <dd>Disable 40-bit encryption with MPPE.</dd>
  <dt><b>nomppe-128</b></dt>
  <dd>Disable 128-bit encryption with MPPE.</dd>
  <dt><b>nomppe-stateful</b></dt>
  <dd>Disable MPPE stateful mode. This is the default.</dd>
  <dt><b>nompshortseq</b></dt>
  <dd>Disables the use of short (12-bit) sequence numbers in the PPP multilink
      protocol, forcing the use of 24-bit sequence numbers. This option is
      currently only available under Linux, and only has any effect if multilink
      is enabled.</dd>
  <dt><b>nomultilink</b></dt>
  <dd>Disables the use of PPP multilink. This option is currently only available
      under Linux.</dd>
  <dt><b>nopcomp</b></dt>
  <dd>Disable protocol field compression negotiation in both the receive and the
      transmit direction.</dd>
  <dt><b>nopersist</b></dt>
  <dd>Exit once a connection has been made and terminated. This is the default
      unless the <i>persist</i> or <i>demand</i> option has been specified.</dd>
  <dt><b>nopredictor1</b></dt>
  <dd>Do not accept or agree to Predictor-1 compression.</dd>
  <dt><b>noproxyarp</b></dt>
  <dd>Disable the <i>proxyarp</i> option. The system administrator who wishes to
      prevent users from creating proxy ARP entries with pppd can do so by
      placing this option in the /etc/ppp/options file.</dd>
  <dt><b>notty</b></dt>
  <dd>Normally, pppd requires a terminal device. With this option, pppd will
      allocate itself a pseudo-tty master/slave pair and use the slave as its
      terminal device. Pppd will create a child process to act as a `character
      shunt' to transfer characters between the pseudo-tty master and its
      standard input and output. Thus pppd will transmit characters on its
      standard output and receive characters on its standard input even if they
      are not terminal devices. This option increases the latency and CPU
      overhead of transferring data over the ppp interface as all of the
      characters sent and received must flow through the character shunt
      process. An explicit device name may not be given if this option is
    used.</dd>
  <dt><b>novj</b></dt>
  <dd>Disable Van Jacobson style TCP/IP header compression in both the transmit
      and the receive direction.</dd>
  <dt><b>novjccomp</b></dt>
  <dd>Disable the connection-ID compression option in Van Jacobson style TCP/IP
      header compression. With this option, pppd will not omit the connection-ID
      byte from Van Jacobson compressed TCP/IP headers, nor ask the peer to do
      so.</dd>
  <dt><b>papcrypt</b></dt>
  <dd>Indicates that all secrets in the /etc/ppp/pap-secrets file which are used
      for checking the identity of the peer are encrypted, and thus pppd should
      not accept a password which, before encryption, is identical to the secret
      from the /etc/ppp/pap-secrets file.</dd>
  <dt><b>pap-max-authreq <i>n</i></b></dt>
  <dd>Set the maximum number of PAP authenticate-request transmissions to
      <i>n</i> (default 10).</dd>
  <dt><b>pap-restart <i>n</i></b></dt>
  <dd>Set the PAP restart interval (retransmission timeout) to <i>n</i> seconds
      (default 3).</dd>
  <dt><b>pap-timeout <i>n</i></b></dt>
  <dd>Set the maximum time that pppd will wait for the peer to authenticate
      itself with PAP to <i>n</i> seconds (0 means no limit).</dd>
  <dt><b>pass-filter <i>filter-expression</i></b></dt>
  <dd>Specifies a packet filter to applied to data packets being sent or
      received to determine which packets should be allowed to pass. Packets
      which are rejected by the filter are silently discarded. This option can
      be used to prevent specific network daemons (such as routed) using up link
      bandwidth, or to provide a very basic firewall capability. The
      <i>filter-expression</i> syntax is as described for tcpdump(1), except
      that qualifiers which are inappropriate for a PPP link, such as
      <b>ether</b> and <b>arp</b>, are not permitted. Generally the filter
      expression should be enclosed in single-quotes to prevent whitespace in
      the expression from being interpreted by the shell. Note that it is
      possible to apply different constraints to incoming and outgoing packets
      using the <b>inbound</b> and <b>outbound</b> qualifiers. This option is
      currently only available under Linux, and requires that the kernel was
      configured to include PPP filtering support (CONFIG_PPP_FILTER).</dd>
  <dt><b>password <i>password-string</i></b></dt>
  <dd>Specifies the password to use for authenticating to the peer. Use of this
      option is discouraged, as the password is likely to be visible to other
      users on the system (for example, by using ps(1)).</dd>
  <dt><b>persist</b></dt>
  <dd>Do not exit after a connection is terminated; instead try to reopen the
      connection. The <b>maxfail</b> option still has an effect on persistent
      connections.</dd>
  <dt><b>plugin <i>filename</i></b></dt>
  <dd>This option is deprecated starting in macOS 10.14. The
      NEPacketTunnelProvider API should be used for VPN plugins.</dd>
  <dt><b>predictor1</b></dt>
  <dd>Request that the peer compress frames that it sends using Predictor-1
      compression, and agree to compress transmitted frames with Predictor-1 if
      requested. This option has no effect unless the kernel driver supports
      Predictor-1 compression.</dd>
  <dt><b>privgroup <i>group-name</i></b></dt>
  <dd>Allows members of group <i>group-name</i> to use privileged options. This
      is a privileged option. Use of this option requires care as there is no
      guarantee that members of <i>group-name</i> cannot use pppd to become root
      themselves. Consider it equivalent to putting the members of
      <i>group-name</i> in the kmem or disk group.</dd>
  <dt><b>proxyarp</b></dt>
  <dd>Add an entry to this system's ARP [Address Resolution Protocol] table with
      the IP address of the peer and the Ethernet address of this system. This
      will have the effect of making the peer appear to other systems to be on
      the local ethernet.</dd>
  <dt><b>pty <i>script</i></b></dt>
  <dd>Specifies that the command <i>script</i> is to be used to communicate
      rather than a specific terminal device. Pppd will allocate itself a
      pseudo-tty master/slave pair and use the slave as its terminal device. The
      <i>script</i> will be run in a child process with the pseudo-tty master as
      its standard input and output. An explicit device name may not be given if
      this option is used. (Note: if the <i>record</i> option is used in
      conjuction with the <i>pty</i> option, the child process will have pipes
      on its standard input and output.)</dd>
  <dt><b>receive-all</b></dt>
  <dd>With this option, pppd will accept all control characters from the peer,
      including those marked in the receive asyncmap. Without this option, pppd
      will discard those characters as specified in RFC1662. This option should
      only be needed if the peer is buggy.</dd>
  <dt><b>record <i>filename</i></b></dt>
  <dd>Specifies that pppd should record all characters sent and received to a
      file named <i>filename</i>. This file is opened in append mode, using the
      user's user-ID and permissions. This option is implemented using a
      pseudo-tty and a process to transfer characters between the pseudo-tty and
      the real serial device, so it will increase the latency and CPU overhead
      of transferring data over the ppp interface. The characters are stored in
      a tagged format with timestamps, which can be displayed in readable form
      using the pppdump(8) program.</dd>
  <dt><b>remotename <i>name</i></b></dt>
  <dd>Set the assumed name of the remote system for authentication purposes to
      <i>name</i>.</dd>
  <dt><b>remotenumber <i>number</i></b></dt>
  <dd>Set the assumed telephone number of the remote system for authentication
      purposes to <i>number</i>.</dd>
  <dt><b>refuse-chap</b></dt>
  <dd>With this option, pppd will not agree to authenticate itself to the peer
      using CHAP.</dd>

  <dd>With this option, pppd will not agree to authenticate itself to the peer
      using MS-CHAP.</dd>

      Authentication Protocol] authentication.</dd>
  <dt><b>require-mppe</b></dt>
  <dd>Require the use of MPPE (Microsoft Point to Point Encryption). This option
      disables all other compression types. This option enables both 40-bit and
      128-bit encryption. In order for MPPE to successfully come up, you must
      have authenticated with either MS-CHAP or MS-CHAPv2. This option is
      presently only supported under Linux, and only if your kernel has been
      configured to include MPPE support.</dd>

      Protocol] authentication.</dd>
  <dt><b>show-password</b></dt>
  <dd>When logging the contents of PAP packets, this option causes pppd to show
      the password string in the log message.</dd>
  <dt><b>silent</b></dt>
  <dd>With this option, pppd will not transmit LCP packets to initiate a
      connection until a valid LCP packet is received from the peer (as for the
      `passive' option with ancient versions of pppd).</dd>
  <dt><b>sync</b></dt>
  <dd>Use synchronous HDLC serial encoding instead of asynchronous. The device
      used by pppd with this option must have sync support. Currently supports
      Microgate SyncLink adapters under Linux and FreeBSD 2.2.8 and later.</dd>
  <dt><b>unit <i>num</i></b></dt>
  <dd>Sets the ppp unit number (for a ppp0 or ppp1 etc interface name) for

  FILES</a></h1>
Options can be taken from files as well as the command line. Pppd reads options
  from the files /etc/ppp/options, ~/.ppprc and /etc/ppp/options.<i>ttyname</i>
  (in that order) before processing the options on the command line. (In fact,
  the command-line options are scanned to find the terminal name before the
  options.<i>ttyname</i> file is read.) In forming the name of the
  options.<i>ttyname</i> file, the initial /dev/ is removed from the terminal
  name, and any remaining / characters are replaced with dots.
<p class="Pp">An options file is parsed into a series of words, delimited by
    whitespace. Whitespace can be included in a word by enclosing the word in
    double-quotes (&quot;). A backslash (\) quotes the following character. A
    hash (#) starts a comment, which continues until the end of the line. There
    is no restriction on using the <i>file</i> or <i>call</i> options within an
    options file.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="SECURITY"><a class="permalink" href="#SECURITY">SECURITY</a></h1>
<i>pppd</i> provides system administrators with sufficient access control that
  PPP access to a server machine can be provided to legitimate users without
  fear of compromising the security of the server or the network it's on. This
  control is provided through restrictions on which IP addresses the peer may
  use, based on its authenticated identity (if any), and through restrictions on
  which options a non-privileged user may use. Several of pppd's options are
  privileged, in particular those which permit potentially insecure
  configurations; these options are only accepted in files which are under the
  control of the system administrator, or if pppd is being run by root.
<p class="Pp">The default behaviour of pppd is to allow an unauthenticated peer
    to use a given IP address only if the system does not already have a route
    to that IP address. For example, a system with a permanent connection to the
    wider internet will normally have a default route, and thus all peers will
    have to authenticate themselves in order to set up a connection. On such a
    system, the <i>auth</i> option is the default. On the other hand, a system
    where the PPP link is the only connection to the internet will not normally
    have a default route, so the peer will be able to use almost any IP address
    without authenticating itself.</p>
<p class="Pp">As indicated above, some security-sensitive options are
    privileged, which means that they may not be used by an ordinary
    non-privileged user running a setuid-root pppd, either on the command line,
    in the user's ~/.ppprc file, or in an options file read using the
    <i>file</i> option. Privileged options may be used in /etc/ppp/options file
    or in an options file read using the <i>call</i> option. If pppd is being
    run by the root user, privileged options can be used without
  restriction.</p>
<p class="Pp">When opening the device, pppd uses either the invoking user's user
    ID or the root UID (that is, 0), depending on whether the device name was
    specified by the user or the system administrator. If the device name comes
    from a privileged source, that is, /etc/ppp/options or an options file read
    using the <i>call</i> option, pppd uses full root privileges when opening
    the device. Thus, by creating an appropriate file under /etc/ppp/peers, the
    system administrator can allow users to establish a ppp connection via a
    device which they would not normally have permission to access. Otherwise
    pppd uses the invoking user's real UID when opening the device.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="AUTHENTICATION"><a class="permalink" href="#AUTHENTICATION">AUTHENTICATION</a></h1>
Authentication is the process whereby one peer convinces the other of its
  identity. This involves the first peer sending its name to the other, together
  with some kind of secret information which could only come from the genuine
  authorized user of that name. In such an exchange, we will call the first peer
  the &quot;client&quot; and the other the &quot;server&quot;. The client has a
  name by which it identifies itself to the server, and the server also has a
  name by which it identifies itself to the client. Generally the genuine client
  shares some secret (or password) with the server, and authenticates itself by
  proving that it knows that secret. Very often, the names used for
  authentication correspond to the internet hostnames of the peers, but this is
  not essential.
<p class="Pp">At present, pppd supports three authentication protocols: the
    Password Authentication Protocol (PAP), Challenge Handshake Authentication
    Protocol (CHAP), and Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP). PAP involves
    the client sending its name and a cleartext password to the server to
    authenticate itself. In contrast, the server initiates the CHAP
    authentication exchange by sending a challenge to the client (the challenge
    packet includes the server's name). The client must respond with a response
    which includes its name plus a hash value derived from the shared secret and
    the challenge, in order to prove that it knows the secret.</p>
<p class="Pp">The PPP protocol, being symmetrical, allows both peers to require
    the other to authenticate itself. In that case, two separate and independent
    authentication exchanges will occur. The two exchanges could use different
    authentication protocols, and in principle, different names could be used in
    the two exchanges.</p>
<p class="Pp">The default behaviour of pppd is to agree to authenticate if
    requested, and to not require authentication from the peer. However, pppd
    will not agree to authenticate itself with a particular protocol if it has
    no secrets which could be used to do so.</p>
<p class="Pp">Pppd stores secrets for use in authentication in secrets files
    (/etc/ppp/pap-secrets for PAP, /etc/ppp/chap-secrets for
    CHAP/MS-CHAP/MS-CHAPv2). Both secrets files have the same format. The
    secrets files can contain secrets for pppd to use in authenticating itself
    to other systems, as well as secrets for pppd to use when authenticating
    other systems to itself.</p>
<p class="Pp">Each line in a secrets file contains one secret. A given secret is
    specific to a particular combination of client and server - it can only be
    used by that client to authenticate itself to that server. Thus each line in
    a secrets file has at least 3 fields: the name of the client, the name of
    the server, and the secret. These fields may be followed by a list of the IP
    addresses that the specified client may use when connecting to the specified
    server.</p>
<p class="Pp">A secrets file is parsed into words as for a options file, so the
    client name, server name and secrets fields must each be one word, with any
    embedded spaces or other special characters quoted or escaped. Note that
    case is significant in the client and server names and in the secret.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the secret starts with an `@', what follows is assumed to be
    the name of a file from which to read the secret. A &quot;*&quot; as the
    client or server name matches any name. When selecting a secret, pppd takes
    the best match, i.e. the match with the fewest wildcards.</p>
<p class="Pp">Any following words on the same line are taken to be a list of
    acceptable IP addresses for that client. If there are only 3 words on the
    line, or if the first word is &quot;-&quot;, then all IP addresses are
    disallowed. To allow any address, use &quot;*&quot;. A word starting with
    &quot;!&quot; indicates that the specified address is <i>not</i> acceptable.
    An address may be followed by &quot;/&quot; and a number <i>n</i>, to
    indicate a whole subnet, i.e. all addresses which have the same value in the
    most significant <i>n</i> bits. In this form, the address may be followed by
    a plus sign (&quot;+&quot;) to indicate that one address from the subnet is
    authorized, based on the ppp network interface unit number in use. In this
    case, the host part of the address will be set to the unit number plus
  one.</p>
<p class="Pp">Thus a secrets file contains both secrets for use in
    authenticating other hosts, plus secrets which we use for authenticating
    ourselves to others. When pppd is authenticating the peer (checking the
    peer's identity), it chooses a secret with the peer's name in the first
    field and the name of the local system in the second field. The name of the
    local system defaults to the hostname, with the domain name appended if the
    <i>domain</i> option is used. This default can be overridden with the
    <i>name</i> option, except when the <i>usehostname</i> option is used.</p>
<p class="Pp">When pppd is choosing a secret to use in authenticating itself to
    the peer, it first determines what name it is going to use to identify
    itself to the peer. This name can be specified by the user with the
    <i>user</i> option. If this option is not used, the name defaults to the
    name of the local system, determined as described in the previous paragraph.
    Then pppd looks for a secret with this name in the first field and the
    peer's name in the second field. Pppd will know the name of the peer if CHAP
    or EAP authentication is being used, because the peer will have sent it in
    the challenge packet. However, if PAP is being used, pppd will have to
    determine the peer's name from the options specified by the user. The user
    can specify the peer's name directly with the <i>remotename</i> option.
    Otherwise, if the remote IP address was specified by a name (rather than in
    numeric form), that name will be used as the peer's name. Failing that, pppd
    will use the null string as the peer's name.</p>
<p class="Pp">When authenticating the peer with PAP, the supplied password is
    first compared with the secret from the secrets file. If the password
    doesn't match the secret, the password is encrypted using crypt() and
    checked against the secret again. Thus secrets for authenticating the peer
    can be stored in encrypted form if desired. If the <i>papcrypt</i> option is
    given, the first (unencrypted) comparison is omitted, for better
  security.</p>
<p class="Pp">Furthermore, if the <i>login</i> option was specified, the
    username and password are also checked against the system password database.
    Thus, the system administrator can set up the pap-secrets file to allow PPP
    access only to certain users, and to restrict the set of IP addresses that
    each user can use. Typically, when using the <i>login</i> option, the secret
    in /etc/ppp/pap-secrets would be &quot;&quot;, which will match any password
    supplied by the peer. This avoids the need to have the same secret in two
    places.</p>
<p class="Pp">Authentication must be satisfactorily completed before IPCP (or
    any other Network Control Protocol) can be started. If the peer is required
    to authenticate itself, and fails to do so, pppd will terminated the link
    (by closing LCP). If IPCP negotiates an unacceptable IP address for the
    remote host, IPCP will be closed. IP packets can only be sent or received
    when IPCP is open.</p>
<p class="Pp">In some cases it is desirable to allow some hosts which can't
    authenticate themselves to connect and use one of a restricted set of IP
    addresses, even when the local host generally requires authentication. If
    the peer refuses to authenticate itself when requested, pppd takes that as
    equivalent to authenticating with PAP using the empty string for the
    username and password. Thus, by adding a line to the pap-secrets file which
    specifies the empty string for the client and password, it is possible to
    allow restricted access to hosts which refuse to authenticate
  themselves.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="ROUTING"><a class="permalink" href="#ROUTING">ROUTING</a></h1>
When IPCP negotiation is completed successfully, pppd will inform the kernel of
  the local and remote IP addresses for the ppp interface. This is sufficient to
  create a host route to the remote end of the link, which will enable the peers
  to exchange IP packets. Communication with other machines generally requires
  further modification to routing tables and/or ARP (Address Resolution
  Protocol) tables. In most cases the <i>defaultroute</i> and/or <i>proxyarp</i>
  options are sufficient for this, but in some cases further intervention is
  required. The /etc/ppp/ip-up script can be used for this.
<p class="Pp">Sometimes it is desirable to add a default route through the
    remote host, as in the case of a machine whose only connection to the
    Internet is through the ppp interface. The <i>defaultroute</i> option causes
    pppd to create such a default route when IPCP comes up, and delete it when
    the link is terminated.</p>
<p class="Pp">In some cases it is desirable to use proxy ARP, for example on a
    server machine connected to a LAN, in order to allow other hosts to
    communicate with the remote host. The <i>proxyarp</i> option causes pppd to
    look for a network interface on the same subnet as the remote host (an
    interface supporting broadcast and ARP, which is up and not a point-to-point
    or loopback interface). If found, pppd creates a permanent, published ARP
    entry with the IP address of the remote host and the hardware address of the
    network interface found.</p>
<p class="Pp">When the <i>demand</i> option is used, the interface IP addresses
    have already been set at the point when IPCP comes up. If pppd has not been
    able to negotiate the same addresses that it used to configure the interface
    (for example when the peer is an ISP that uses dynamic IP address
    assignment), pppd has to change the interface IP addresses to the negotiated
    addresses. This may disrupt existing connections, and the use of demand
    dialing with peers that do dynamic IP address assignment is not
  recommended.</p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="MULTILINK"><a class="permalink" href="#MULTILINK">MULTILINK</a></h1>
Multilink PPP provides the capability to combine two or more PPP links between a
  pair of machines into a single `bundle', which appears as a single virtual PPP
  link which has the combined bandwidth of the individual links. Currently,
  multilink PPP is only supported under Linux.
<p class="Pp">Pppd detects that the link it is controlling is connected to the
    same peer as another link using the peer's endpoint discriminator and the
    authenticated identity of the peer (if it authenticates itself). The
    endpoint discriminator is a block of data which is hopefully unique for each
    peer. Several types of data can be used, including locally-assigned strings
    of bytes, IP addresses, MAC addresses, randomly strings of bytes, or E-164
    phone numbers. The endpoint discriminator sent to the peer by pppd can be
    set using the endpoint option.</p>
<p class="Pp">In circumstances the peer may send no endpoint discriminator or a
    non-unique value. The optional bundle option adds an extra string which is
    added to the peer's endpoint discriminator and authenticated identity when
    matching up links to be joined together in a bundle. The bundle option can
    also be used to allow the establishment of multiple bundles between the
    local system and the peer. Pppd uses a TDB database in /var/run/pppd.tdb to
    match up links.</p>
<p class="Pp">Assuming that multilink is enabled and the peer is willing to
    negotiate multilink, then when pppd is invoked to bring up the first link to
    the peer, it will detect that no other link is connected to the peer and
    create a new bundle, that is, another ppp network interface unit. When
    another pppd is invoked to bring up another link to the peer, it will detect
    the existing bundle and join its link to it. Currently, if the first pppd
    terminates (for example, because of a hangup or a received signal) the
    bundle is destroyed.</p>

The following examples assume that the /etc/ppp/options file contains the
  <i>auth</i> option (as in the default /etc/ppp/options file in the ppp
  distribution).
<p class="Pp">Probably the most common use of pppd is to dial out to an ISP.
    This can be done with a command such as</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>pppd call isp</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">where the /etc/ppp/peers/isp file is set up by the system
    administrator to contain something like this:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>ttyS0 19200 crtscts
    <br/>
    connect '/usr/sbin/chat -v -f /etc/ppp/chat-isp'
    <br/>
    noauth</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">In this example, we are using chat to dial the ISP's modem and go
    through any logon sequence required. The /etc/ppp/chat-isp file contains the
    script used by chat; it could for example contain something like this:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>ABORT &quot;NO CARRIER&quot;

    &quot;~-^Uppp-~&quot;</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">See the chat(8) man page for details of chat scripts.</p>
<p class="Pp">Pppd can also be used to provide a dial-in ppp service for users.
    If the users already have login accounts, the simplest way to set up the ppp
    service is to let the users log in to their accounts and run pppd (installed
    setuid-root) with a command such as</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>pppd proxyarp</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">To allow a user to use the PPP facilities, you need to allocate an
    IP address for that user's machine and create an entry in
    /etc/ppp/pap-secrets or /etc/ppp/chap-secrets (depending on which
    authentication method the PPP implementation on the user's machine
    supports), so that the user's machine can authenticate itself. For example,
    if Joe has a machine called &quot;joespc&quot; which is to be allowed to
    dial in to the machine called &quot;server&quot; and use the IP address
    joespc.my.net, you would add an entry like this to /etc/ppp/pap-secrets or
    /etc/ppp/chap-secrets:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>joespc	server	&quot;joe's secret&quot;	joespc.my.net</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Alternatively, you can create a username called (for example)
    &quot;ppp&quot;, whose login shell is pppd and whose home directory is
    /etc/ppp. Options to be used when pppd is run this way can be put in
    /etc/ppp/.ppprc.</p>
<p class="Pp">If your serial connection is any more complicated than a piece of
    wire, you may need to arrange for some control characters to be escaped. In
    particular, it is often useful to escape XON (^Q) and XOFF (^S), using
    <i>asyncmap a0000</i>. If the path includes a telnet, you probably should
    escape ^] as well (<i>asyncmap 200a0000</i>). If the path includes an
    rlogin, you will need to use the <i>escape ff</i> option on the end which is
    running the rlogin client, since many rlogin implementations are not
    transparent; they will remove the sequence [0xff, 0xff, 0x73, 0x73, followed
    by any 8 bytes] from the stream.</p>

Messages are sent to the syslog daemon using facility LOG_RAS. (This can be

  facility.) See the syslog(8) documentation for details of where the syslog
  daemon will write the messages. On most systems, the syslog daemon uses the
  /etc/syslog.conf file to specify the destination(s) for syslog messages. You
  may need to edit that file to suit.
<p class="Pp">The <i>debug</i> option causes the contents of all control packets
    sent or received to be logged, that is, all LCP, PAP, CHAP, EAP or IPCP
    packets. This can be useful if the PPP negotiation does not succeed or if
    authentication fails. If debugging is enabled at compile time, the

<h1 class="Sh" id="SCRIPTS"><a class="permalink" href="#SCRIPTS">SCRIPTS</a></h1>
Pppd invokes scripts at various stages in its processing which can be used to
  perform site-specific ancillary processing. These scripts are usually shell
  scripts, but could be executable code files instead. Pppd does not wait for
  the scripts to finish. The scripts are executed as root (with the real and
  effective user-id set to 0), so that they can do things such as update routing
  tables or run privileged daemons. Be careful that the contents of these
  scripts do not compromise your system's security. Pppd runs the scripts with
  standard input, output and error redirected to /dev/null, and with an
  environment that is empty except for some environment variables that give
  information about the link. The environment variables that pppd sets are:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>DEVICE</b></dt>
  <dd>The name of the serial tty device being used.</dd>
  <dt><b>IFNAME</b></dt>
  <dd>The name of the network interface being used.</dd>

  <dd>The IP address for the local end of the link. This is only set when IPCP

Some limited degree of control can be exercised over a running pppd process by
  sending it a signal from the list below.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>SIGINT, SIGTERM</b></dt>
  <dd>These signals cause pppd to terminate the link (by closing LCP), restore
      the serial device settings, and exit.</dd>
  <dt><b>SIGHUP</b></dt>
  <dd>This signal causes pppd to terminate the link, restore the serial device
      settings, and close the serial device. If the <i>persist</i> or
      <i>demand</i> option has been specified, pppd will try to reopen the
      serial device and start another connection (after the holdoff period).
      Otherwise pppd will exit. If this signal is received during the holdoff
      period, it causes pppd to end the holdoff period immediately.</dd>
  <dt><b>SIGUSR1</b></dt>
  <dd>This signal toggles the state of the <i>debug</i> option.</dd>
  <dt><b>SIGUSR2</b></dt>
  <dd>This signal causes pppd to renegotiate compression. This can be useful to
      re-enable compression after it has been disabled as a result of a fatal
      decompression error. (Fatal decompression errors generally indicate a bug
      in one or other implementation.)
