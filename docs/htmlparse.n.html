   The definitions below are for supplemental macros used in Tcl/Tk
   manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget.  The
  	options follow on successive lines, in four columns separated
  	by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.

<p class="Pp">The <b>htmlparse</b> package provides commands that allow
    libraries and applications to parse HTML in a string into a representation
    of their choice.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following commands are available:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>::htmlparse::parse</b> ?-cmd <i>cmd</i>? ?-vroot <i>tag</i>? ?-split
    <i>n</i>? ?-incvar <i>var</i>? ?-queue <i>q</i>? <i>html</i></dt>
  <dd>This command is the basic parser for HTML. It takes an HTML string, parses
      it and invokes a command prefix for every tag encountered. It is not
      necessary for the HTML to be valid for this parser to function. It is the
      responsibility of the command invoked for every tag to check this. Another
      responsibility of the invoked command is the handling of tag attributes
      and character entities (escaped characters). The parser provides the
      un-interpreted tag attributes to the invoked command to aid in the former,
      and the package at large provides a helper command,
      <b>::htmlparse::mapEscapes</b>, to aid in the handling of the latter. The
      parser <i>does</i> ignore leading DOCTYPE declarations and all valid HTML
      comments it encounters.
    <p class="Pp">All information beyond the HTML string itself is specified via
        options, these are explained below.</p>
    <p class="Pp">To help understand the options, some more background
        information about the parser.</p>
    <p class="Pp">It is capable of detecting incomplete tags in the HTML string
        given to it. Under normal circumstances this will cause the parser to
        throw an error, but if the option <i>-incvar</i> is used to specify a
        global (or namespace) variable, the parser will store the incomplete
        part of the input into this variable instead. This will aid greatly in
        the handling of incrementally arriving HTML, as the parser will handle
        whatever it can and defer the handling of the incomplete part until more
        data has arrived.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Another feature of the parser are its two possible modes of
        operation. The normal mode is activated if the option <i>-queue</i> is
        not present on the command line invoking the parser. If it is present,
        the parser will go into the incremental mode instead.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The main difference is that a parser in normal mode will
        immediately invoke the command prefix for each tag it encounters. In
        incremental mode however the parser will generate a number of scripts
        which invoke the command prefix for groups of tags in the HTML string
        and then store these scripts in the specified queue. It is then the
        responsibility of the caller of the parser to ensure the execution of
        the scripts in the queue.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><i>Note</i>: The queue object given to the parser has to
        provide the same interface as the queue defined in tcllib -&gt; struct.
        This means, for example, that all queues created via that tcllib module
        can be immediately used here. Still, the queue doesn't have to come from
        tcllib -&gt; struct as long as the same interface is provided.</p>
    <p class="Pp">In both modes the parser will return an empty string to the
        caller.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The <i>-split</i> option may be given to a parser in
        incremental mode to specify the size of the groups it creates. In other
        words, -split 5 means that each of the generated scripts will invoke the
        command prefix for 5 consecutive tags in the HTML string. A parser in
        normal mode will ignore this option and its value.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The option <i>-vroot</i> specifies a virtual root tag. A
        parser in normal mode will invoke the command prefix for it immediately
        before and after it processes the tags in the HTML, thus simulating that
        the HTML string is enclosed in a &lt;vroot&gt; &lt;/vroot&gt;
        combination. In incremental mode however the parser is unable to provide
        the closing virtual root as it never knows when the input is complete.
        In this case the first script generated by each invocation of the parser
        will contain an invocation of the command prefix for the virtual root as
        its first command. The following options are available:</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="cmd"><a class="permalink" href="#cmd"><b>-cmd</b> <i>cmd</i></a></dt>
  <dd>The command prefix to invoke for every tag in the HTML string. Defaults to
      <i>::htmlparse::debugCallback</i>.</dd>
  <dt id="vroot"><a class="permalink" href="#vroot"><b>-vroot</b>
    <i>tag</i></a></dt>
  <dd>The virtual root tag to add around the HTML in normal mode. In incremental
      mode it is the first tag in each chunk processed by the parser, but there
      will be no closing tags. Defaults to <i>hmstart</i>.</dd>
  <dt id="split"><a class="permalink" href="#split"><b>-split</b>
    <i>n</i></a></dt>
  <dd>The size of the groups produced by an incremental mode parser. Ignored
      when in normal mode. Defaults to 10. Values &lt;= 0 are not allowed.</dd>
  <dt id="incvar"><a class="permalink" href="#incvar"><b>-incvar</b>
    <i>var</i></a></dt>
  <dd>The name of the variable where to store any incomplete HTML into. This
      makes most sense for the incremental mode. The parser will throw an error
      if it sees incomplete HTML and has no place to store it to. This makes
      sense for the normal mode. Only incomplete tags are detected, not missing
      tags. Optional, defaults to 'no variable'.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp"></p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="Interface"><a class="permalink" href="#Interface"><i>Interface to the
    command prefix</i></a></dt>
  <dd>In normal mode the parser will invoke the command prefix with four
      arguments appended. See <b>::htmlparse::debugCallback</b> for a
      description.
    <p class="Pp">In incremental mode, however, the generated scripts will
        invoke the command prefix with five arguments appended. The last four of
        these are the same which were mentioned above. The first is a
        placeholder string (<b>@win@</b>) for a clientdata value to be supplied
        later during the actual execution of the generated scripts. This could
        be a tk window path, for example. This allows the user of this package
        to preprocess HTML strings without committing them to a specific window,
        object, whatever during parsing. This connection can be made later. This
        also means that it is possible to cache preprocessed HTML. Of course,
        nothing prevents the user of the parser from replacing the placeholder
        with an empty string.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>::htmlparse::debugCallback</b> ?<i>clientdata</i>? <i>tag slash param
    textBehindTheTag</i></dt>
  <dd>This command is the standard callback used by the parser in
      <b>::htmlparse::parse</b> if none was specified by the user. It simply
      dumps its arguments to stdout. This callback can be used for both normal
      and incremental mode of the calling parser. In other words, it accepts
      four or five arguments. The last four arguments are described below. The
      optional fifth argument contains the clientdata value passed to the
      callback by a parser in incremental mode. All callbacks have to follow the
      signature of this command in the last four arguments, and callbacks used
      in incremental parsing have to follow this signature in the last five
      arguments.
    <p class="Pp">The first argument, <i>clientdata</i>, is optional and present
        only if this command is invoked by a parser in incremental mode. It
        contains whatever the user of this package wishes.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The second argument, <i>tag</i>, contains the name of the tag
        which is currently processed by the parser.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The third argument, <i>slash</i>, is either empty or contains
        a slash character. It allows the callback to distinguish between opening
        (slash is empty) and closing tags (slash contains a slash
      character).</p>
    <p class="Pp">The fourth argument, <i>param</i>, contains the un-interpreted
        list of parameters to the tag.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The fifth and last argument, <i>textBehindTheTag</i>, contains
        the text found by the parser behind the tag named in <i>tag</i>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>::htmlparse::mapEscapes</b> <i>html</i></dt>
  <dd>This command takes a HTML string, substitutes all escape sequences with
      their actual characters and then returns the resulting string. HTML
      strings which do not contain escape sequences are returned unchanged.</dd>
  <dt><b>::htmlparse::2tree</b> <i>html tree</i></dt>
  <dd>This command is a wrapper around <b>::htmlparse::parse</b> which takes an
      HTML string (in <i>html</i>) and converts it into a tree containing the
      logical structure of the parsed document. The name of the tree is given to
      the command as its second argument (<i>tree</i>). The command does
      <b>not</b> generate the tree by itself but expects that the caller
      provided it with an existing and empty tree. It also expects that the
      specified tree object follows the same interface as the tree object in
      tcllib -&gt; struct. It doesn't have to be from tcllib -&gt; struct, but
      it must provide the same interface.
    <p class="Pp">The internal callback does some basic checking of HTML
        validity and tries to recover from the most basic errors. The command
        returns the contents of its second argument. Side effects are the
        creation and manipulation of a tree object.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Each node in the generated tree represent one tag in the
        input. The name of the tag is stored in the attribute <i>type</i> of the
        node. Any html attributes coming with the tag are stored unmodified in
        the attribute <i>data</i> of the tag. In other words, the command does
        <i>not</i> parse html attributes into their names and values.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If a tag contains text its node will have children of type
        <i>PCDATA</i> containing this text. The text will be stored in the
        attribute <i>data</i> of these children.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>::htmlparse::removeVisualFluff</b> <i>tree</i></dt>
  <dd>This command walks a tree as generated by <b>::htmlparse::2tree</b> and
      removes all the nodes which represent visual tags and not structural ones.
      The purpose of the command is to make the tree easier to navigate without
      getting bogged down in visual information not relevant to the search. Its
      only argument is the name of the tree to cut down.</dd>
  <dt><b>::htmlparse::removeFormDefs</b> <i>tree</i></dt>
  <dd>Like <b>::htmlparse::removeVisualFluff</b> this command is here to cut
      down on the size of the tree as generated by <b>::htmlparse::2tree</b>. It
      removes all nodes representing forms and form elements. Its only argument
      is the name of the tree to cut down.</dd>
