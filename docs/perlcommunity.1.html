   Set up some character translations and predefined strings.  \*(-- will
   give an unbreakable dash, \*(PI will give pi, \*(L" will give a left
   double quote, and \*(R" will give a right double quote.  \*(C+ will
   give a nicer C++.  Capital omega is used to do unbreakable dashes and
   therefore won't be available.  \*(C` and \*(C' expand to `' in nroff,
   nothing in troff, for use with C<>.

perlcommunity - a brief overview of the Perl community
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
This document aims to provide an overview of the vast perl community, which is
  far too large and diverse to provide a detailed listing. If any specific niche
  has been forgotten, it is not meant as an insult but an omission for the sake
  of brevity.
<p class="Pp">The Perl community is as diverse as Perl, and there is a large
    amount of evidence that the Perl users apply TMTOWTDI to all endeavors, not
    just programming. From websites, to IRC, to mailing lists, there is more
    than one way to get involved in the community.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Where_to_Find_the_Community"><a class="permalink" href="#Where_to_Find_the_Community">Where
  to Find the Community</a></h2>
There is a central directory for the Perl community: &lt;http://perl.org&gt;
  maintained by the Perl Foundation (&lt;http://www.perlfoundation.org/&gt;),
  which tracks and provides services for a variety of other community sites.
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Mailing_Lists_and_Newsgroups"><a class="permalink" href="#Mailing_Lists_and_Newsgroups">Mailing
  Lists and Newsgroups</a></h2>
Perl runs on e-mail; there is no doubt about it. The Camel book was originally
  written mostly over e-mail and today Perl's development is co-ordinated
  through mailing lists. The largest repository of Perl mailing lists is located
  at &lt;http://lists.perl.org&gt;.
<p class="Pp">Most Perl-related projects set up mailing lists for both users and
    contributors. If you don't see a certain project listed at
    &lt;http://lists.perl.org&gt;, check the particular website for that
    project. Most mailing lists are archived at
  &lt;http://nntp.perl.org/&gt;.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="_s-1IRC_s0"><a class="permalink" href="#_s-1IRC_s0">IRC</a></h2>
The Perl community has a rather large IRC presence. For starters, it has its own
  IRC network, &lt;irc://irc.perl.org&gt;. General (not help-oriented) chat can
  be found at &lt;irc://irc.perl.org/#perl&gt;. Many other more specific chats
  are also hosted on the network. Information about irc.perl.org is located on
  the network's website: &lt;http://www.irc.perl.org&gt;. For a more
  help-oriented #perl, check out &lt;irc://irc.freenode.net/#perl&gt;. Perl 6
  development also has a presence in &lt;irc://irc.freenode.net/#perl6&gt;. Most
  Perl-related channels will be kind enough to point you in the right direction
  if you ask nicely.
<p class="Pp">Any large IRC network (Dalnet, EFnet) is also likely to have a
    #perl channel, with varying activity levels.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Websites"><a class="permalink" href="#Websites">Websites</a></h2>
Perl websites come in a variety of forms, but they fit into two large
  categories: forums and news websites. There are many Perl-related websites, so
  only a few of the community's largest are mentioned here.
<p class="Pp"><i>News sites</i></p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>&lt;http://perl.com/&gt;</dt>
  <dd>Originally run by O'Reilly Media (the publisher of the Camel Book, this
      site provides quality articles mostly about technical details of
    Perl.</dd>
  <dt>&lt;http://blogs.perl.org/&gt;</dt>
  <dd>Many members of the community have a Perl-related blog on this site. If
      you'd like to join them, you can sign up for free.</dd>
  <dt>&lt;http://perlsphere.net/&gt;</dt>
  <dd>Perlsphere is one of several aggregators of Perl-related blog feeds.</dd>
  <dt>&lt;http://perlweekly.com/&gt;</dt>
  <dd>Perl Weekly is a weekly mailing list that keeps you up to date on
      conferences, releases and notable blog posts.</dd>
  <dt>&lt;http://use.perl.org/&gt;</dt>
  <dd>use Perl; used to provide a slashdot-style news/blog website covering all
      things Perl, from minutes of the meetings of the Perl 6 Design team to
      conference announcements with (ir)relevant discussion. It no longer
      accepts updates, but you can still use the site to read old entries and
      comments.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp"><i>Forums</i></p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>&lt;http://www.perlmonks.org/&gt;</dt>
  <dd>PerlMonks is one of the largest Perl forums, and describes itself as
      &quot;A place for individuals to polish, improve, and showcase their Perl
      skills.&quot; and &quot;A community which allows everyone to grow and
      learn from each other.&quot;</dd>
  <dt>&lt;http://stackoverflow.com/&gt;</dt>
  <dd>Stack Overflow is a free question-and-answer site for programmers. It's
      not focussed solely on Perl, but it does have an active group of users who
      do their best to help people with their Perl programming questions.</dd>
  <dt>&lt;http://prepan.org/&gt;</dt>
  <dd>PrePAN is used as a place to discuss modules that you're considering
      uploading to the CPAN. You can get feedback on their design before you
      upload.</dd>

<h2 class="Ss" id="User_Groups"><a class="permalink" href="#User_Groups">User
  Groups</a></h2>
Many cities around the world have local Perl Mongers chapters. A Perl Mongers
  chapter is a local user group which typically holds regular in-person
  meetings, both social and technical; helps organize local conferences,
  workshops, and hackathons; and provides a mailing list or other continual
  contact method for its members to keep in touch.
<p class="Pp">To find your local Perl Mongers (or PM as they're commonly
    abbreviated) group check the international Perl Mongers directory at
    &lt;http://www.pm.org/&gt;.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Workshops"><a class="permalink" href="#Workshops">Workshops</a></h2>
Perl workshops are, as the name might suggest, workshops where Perl is taught in
  a variety of ways. At the workshops, subjects range from a beginner's
  introduction (such as the Pittsburgh Perl Workshop's &quot;Zero To Perl&quot;)
  to much more advanced subjects.
<p class="Pp">There are several great resources for locating workshops: the
    websites mentioned above, the calendar mentioned below, and the YAPC Europe
    website, &lt;http://www.yapceurope.org/&gt;, which is probably the best
    resource for European Perl events.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Hackathons"><a class="permalink" href="#Hackathons">Hackathons</a></h2>
Hackathons are a very different kind of gathering where Perl hackers gather to
  do just that, hack nonstop for an extended (several day) period on a specific
  project or projects. Information about hackathons can be located in the same
  place as information about workshops as well as in
  &lt;irc://irc.perl.org/#perl&gt;.
<p class="Pp">If you have never been to a hackathon, here are a few basic things
    you need to know before attending: have a working laptop and know how to use
    it; check out the involved projects beforehand; have the necessary version
    control client; and bring backup equipment (an extra LAN cable, additional
    power strips, etc.) because someone will forget.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Conventions"><a class="permalink" href="#Conventions">Conventions</a></h2>
Perl has two major annual conventions: The Perl Conference (now part of OSCON),
  put on by O'Reilly, and Yet Another Perl Conference or YAPC (pronounced
  yap-see), which is localized into several regional YAPCs (North America,
  Europe, Asia) in a stunning grassroots display by the Perl community. For more
  information about either conference, check out their respective web pages:
  OSCON &lt;http://conferences.oreillynet.com/&gt;; YAPC
  &lt;http://www.yapc.org&gt;.
<p class="Pp">A relatively new conference franchise with a large Perl portion is
    the Open Source Developers Conference or OSDC. First held in Australia it
    has recently also spread to Israel and France. More information can be found
    at: &lt;http://www.osdc.com.au/&gt; for Australia,
    &lt;http://www.osdc.org.il&gt; for Israel, and &lt;http://www.osdc.fr/&gt;
    for France.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Calendar_of_Perl_Events"><a class="permalink" href="#Calendar_of_Perl_Events">Calendar
  of Perl Events</a></h2>
The Perl Review, &lt;http://www.theperlreview.com&gt; maintains a website and
  Google calendar (&lt;http://www.theperlreview.com/community_calendar&gt;) for
  tracking workshops, hackathons, Perl Mongers meetings, and other events. Views
  of this calendar are at &lt;http://www.perl.org/events.html&gt; and
  &lt;http://www.yapc.org&gt;.
<p class="Pp">Not every event or Perl Mongers group is on that calendar, so
    don't lose heart if you don't see yours posted. To have your event or group
    listed, contact brian d foy (brian@theperlreview.com).</p>
