<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;Net::FTP&quot;</span> is a class
    implementing a simple FTP client in Perl as described in RFC959. It provides
    wrappers for a subset of the RFC959 commands.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="OVERVIEW"><a class="permalink" href="#OVERVIEW">OVERVIEW</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol. It is a way of transferring
    files between networked machines. The protocol defines a client (whose
    commands are provided by this module) and a server (not implemented in this
    module). Communication is always initiated by the client, and the server
    responds with a message and a status code (and sometimes with data).</p>
<p class="Pp">The FTP protocol allows files to be sent to or fetched from the
    server. Each transfer involves a <b>local file</b> (on the client) and a
    <b>remote file</b> (on the server). In this module, the same file name will
    be used for both local and remote if only one is specified. This means that
    transferring remote file <span class="Li">&quot;/path/to/file&quot;</span>
    will try to put that file in
    <span class="Li">&quot;/path/to/file&quot;</span> locally, unless you
    specify a local file name.</p>
<p class="Pp">The protocol also defines several standard <b>translations</b>
    which the file can undergo during transfer. These are ASCII, EBCDIC, binary,
    and byte. ASCII is the default type, and indicates that the sender of files
    will translate the ends of lines to a standard representation which the
    receiver will then translate back into their local representation. EBCDIC
    indicates the file being transferred is in EBCDIC format. Binary (also known
    as image) format sends the data as a contiguous bit stream. Byte format
    transfers the data as bytes, the values of which remain the same regardless
    of differences in byte size between the two machines (in theory - in
    practice you should only use this if you really know what you're doing).</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="CONSTRUCTOR"><a class="permalink" href="#CONSTRUCTOR">CONSTRUCTOR</a></h1>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="new"><a class="permalink" href="#new">new ([ HOST ] [, OPTIONS
    ])</a></dt>
  <dd>This is the constructor for a new Net::FTP object.
      <span class="Li">&quot;HOST&quot;</span> is the name of the remote host to
      which an FTP connection is required.
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;HOST&quot;</span> is optional. If
        <span class="Li">&quot;HOST&quot;</span> is not given then it may
        instead be passed as the <span class="Li">&quot;Host&quot;</span> option
        described below.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;OPTIONS&quot;</span> are passed in a
        hash like fashion, using key and value pairs. Possible options are:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><b>Host</b> - FTP host to connect to. It may be a single
        scalar, as defined for the <span class="Li">&quot;PeerAddr&quot;</span>
        option in IO::Socket::INET, or a reference to an array with hosts to try
        in turn. The &quot;host&quot; method will return the value which was
        used to connect to the host.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><b>Firewall</b> - The name of a machine which acts as an FTP
        firewall. This can be overridden by an environment variable
        <span class="Li">&quot;FTP_FIREWALL&quot;</span>. If specified, and the
        given host cannot be directly connected to, then the connection is made
        to the firewall machine and the string <span class="Li">@hostname</span>
        is appended to the login identifier. This kind of setup is also referred
        to as an ftp proxy.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><b>FirewallType</b> - The type of firewall running on the
        machine indicated by <b>Firewall</b>. This can be overridden by an
        environment variable
        <span class="Li">&quot;FTP_FIREWALL_TYPE&quot;</span>. For a list of
        permissible types, see the description of ftp_firewall_type in
        Net::Config.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><b>BlockSize</b> - This is the block size that Net::FTP will
        use when doing transfers. (defaults to 10240)</p>
    <p class="Pp"><b>Port</b> - The port number to connect to on the remote
        machine for the FTP connection</p>
    <p class="Pp"><b>Timeout</b> - Set a timeout value (defaults to 120)</p>
    <p class="Pp"><b>Debug</b> - debug level (see the debug method in
      Net::Cmd)</p>
    <p class="Pp"><b>Passive</b> - If set to a non-zero value then all data
        transfers will be done using passive mode. If set to zero then data
        transfers will be done using active mode. If the machine is connected to
        the Internet directly, both passive and active mode should work equally
        well. Behind most firewall and NAT configurations passive mode has a
        better chance of working. However, in some rare firewall configurations,
        active mode actually works when passive mode doesn't. Some really old
        FTP servers might not implement passive transfers. If not specified,
        then the transfer mode is set by the environment variable
        <span class="Li">&quot;FTP_PASSIVE&quot;</span> or if that one is not
        set by the settings done by the <i>libnetcfg</i> utility. If none of
        these apply then passive mode is used.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><b>Hash</b> - If given a reference to a file handle (e.g.,
        <span class="Li">&quot;\*STDERR&quot;</span>), print hash marks (#) on
        that filehandle every 1024 bytes. This simply invokes the
        <span class="Li">&quot;hash()&quot;</span> method for you, so that hash
        marks are displayed for all transfers. You can, of course, call
        <span class="Li">&quot;hash()&quot;</span> explicitly whenever you'd
        like.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><b>LocalAddr</b> - Local address to use for all socket
        connections, this argument will be passed to IO::Socket::INET</p>
    <p class="Pp">If the constructor fails undef will be returned and an error
        message will be in $@</p>
  </dd>

<h1 class="Sh" id="METHODS"><a class="permalink" href="#METHODS">METHODS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Unless otherwise stated all methods return either a <i>true</i> or
    <i>false</i> value, with <i>true</i> meaning that the operation was a
    success. When a method states that it returns a value, failure will be
    returned as <i>undef</i> or an empty list.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="login"><a class="permalink" href="#login">login ([LOGIN [,PASSWORD [,
    ACCOUNT] ] ])</a></dt>
  <dd>Log into the remote FTP server with the given login information. If no
      arguments are given then the <span class="Li">&quot;Net::FTP&quot;</span>
      uses the <span class="Li">&quot;Net::Netrc&quot;</span> package to lookup
      the login information for the connected host. If no information is found
      then a login of <i>anonymous</i> is used. If no password is given and the
      login is <i>anonymous</i> then <i>anonymous@</i> will be used for
      password.
    <p class="Pp">If the connection is via a firewall then the
        <span class="Li">&quot;authorize&quot;</span> method will be called with
        no arguments.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="authorize"><a class="permalink" href="#authorize">authorize ( [AUTH [,
    RESP]])</a></dt>
  <dd>This is a protocol used by some firewall ftp proxies. It is used to
      authorise the user to send data out. If both arguments are not specified
      then <span class="Li">&quot;authorize&quot;</span> uses
      <span class="Li">&quot;Net::Netrc&quot;</span> to do a lookup.</dd>
  <dt id="site"><a class="permalink" href="#site">site (ARGS)</a></dt>
  <dd>Send a SITE command to the remote server and wait for a response.
    <p class="Pp">Returns most significant digit of the response code.</p>

  <dt id="ascii"><a class="permalink" href="#ascii">ascii</a></dt>
  <dd>Transfer file in ASCII. CRLF translation will be done if required</dd>
  <dt id="binary"><a class="permalink" href="#binary">binary</a></dt>
  <dd>Transfer file in binary mode. No transformation will be done.
    <p class="Pp"><b>Hint</b>: If both server and client machines use the same
        line ending for text files, then it will be faster to transfer all files
        in binary mode.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="rename"><a class="permalink" href="#rename">rename ( OLDNAME, NEWNAME
    )</a></dt>
  <dd>Rename a file on the remote FTP server from
      <span class="Li">&quot;OLDNAME&quot;</span> to
      <span class="Li">&quot;NEWNAME&quot;</span>. This is done by sending the
      RNFR and RNTO commands.</dd>
  <dt id="delete"><a class="permalink" href="#delete">delete ( FILENAME

  <dd>Set the byte offset at which to begin the next data transfer. Net::FTP
      simply records this value and uses it when during the next data transfer.
      For this reason this method will not return an error, but setting it may
      cause a subsequent data transfer to fail.</dd>
  <dt id="rmdir"><a class="permalink" href="#rmdir">rmdir ( DIR [, RECURSE
    ])</a></dt>
  <dd>Remove the directory with the name
      <span class="Li">&quot;DIR&quot;</span>. If
      <span class="Li">&quot;RECURSE&quot;</span> is <i>true</i> then
      <span class="Li">&quot;rmdir&quot;</span> will attempt to delete
      everything inside the directory.</dd>
  <dt id="mkdir"><a class="permalink" href="#mkdir">mkdir ( DIR [, RECURSE

  </dd>
  <dt id="alloc"><a class="permalink" href="#alloc">alloc ( SIZE [, RECORD_SIZE]
    )</a></dt>
  <dd>The alloc command allows you to give the ftp server a hint about the size
      of the file about to be transferred using the ALLO ftp command. Some
      storage systems use this to make intelligent decisions about how to store
      the file. The <span class="Li">&quot;SIZE&quot;</span> argument represents
      the size of the file in bytes. The
      <span class="Li">&quot;RECORD_SIZE&quot;</span> argument indicates a
      maximum record or page size for files sent with a record or page
      structure.
    <p class="Pp">The size of the file will be determined, and sent to the
        server automatically for normal files so that this method need only be
        called if you are transferring data from a socket, named pipe, or other
        stream not associated with a normal file.</p>

      store locally. <span class="Li">&quot;LOCAL_FILE&quot;</span> may be a
      filename or a filehandle. If not specified, the file will be stored in the
      current directory with the same leafname as the remote file.
    <p class="Pp">If <span class="Li">&quot;WHERE&quot;</span> is given then the
        first <span class="Li">&quot;WHERE&quot;</span> bytes of the file will
