    the argument <var class="Fa">policy</var> is an integer which contains the

<p class="Pp">The I/O type is specified in the argument
    <var class="Fa">iotype</var>. The currently supported I/O types are as
    follows:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>IOPOL_TYPE_DISK</dt>
  <dd>This can mean either the I/O policy for I/Os to local disks or to remote
      volumes. I/Os to local disks are I/Os sent to the media without going
      through a network, including I/Os to internal and external hard drives,
      optical media in internal and external drives, flash drives, floppy disks,
      ram disks, and mounted disk images which reside on these media. I/Os to
      remote volumes are I/Os that require network activity to complete the
      operation. This is currently only supported for remote volumes mounted by
      SMB or AFP.
    <p class="Pp">IOPOL_TYPE_DISK supports following values for
        <var class="Fa">policy:</var></p>
    <dl class="Bl-tag">
      <dt>IOPOL_IMPORTANT</dt>
      <dd>I/Os with the IMPORTANT policy are unrestricted. This policy should
          only be used for I/Os that are critical to system responsiveness. This
          is the default I/O policy for new threads.</dd>
      <dt>IOPOL_STANDARD</dt>
      <dd>The STANDARD policy is for work requested by the user, but that is not
          the user's current focus. I/Os with this policy may be delayed
          slightly to allow IMPORTANT I/Os to complete quickly.</dd>
      <dt>IOPOL_UTILITY</dt>
      <dd>The UTILITY policy is for short-running background work. I/Os with
          this policy are throttled to prevent a significant impact on the
          latency of IMPORTANT and STANDARD I/Os.</dd>
      <dt>IOPOL_THROTTLE</dt>
      <dd>The THROTTLE policy is for long-running I/O intensive background work,
          such as backups, search indexing, or file synchronization. I/Os with
          this policy will be throttled to avoid impacting performance of higher
          priority I/Os.</dd>
      <dt>IOPOL_PASSIVE</dt>
      <dd>The PASSIVE I/Os are a special type of I/O that are ignored by the
          other policies so that the threads issuing lower priority I/Os are not
          slowed down by PASSIVE I/Os. The PASSIVE I/O policy is useful for
          server type applications. The I/Os generated by these applications are
          called passive I/Os because these I/Os are caused directly or
          indirectly by the I/O requests they receive from client applications.
          For example, when an image file is mounted by DiskImages, DiskImages
          generate passive I/Os. DiskImages should mark these I/Os using the
          PASSIVE I/O policy so that when client applications that access the
          volume managed by DiskImages, these client applications will not be
          slowed down by the I/Os generated by DiskImages.</dd>
    </dl>
    <p class="Pp">I/Os with the STANDARD, UTILITY, and THROTTLE policies are
        called throttleable I/Os and are of decreasing priority. If a
        throttleable request occurs within a small time window of a request of
        higher priority, the thread that issued the throttleable I/O is forced
        to a sleep for a short period. (Both this window and the sleep period
        are dependent on the policy of the throttleable I/O.) This slows down
        the thread that issues the throttleable I/O so that higher-priority I/Os
        can complete with low-latency and receive a greater share of the disk
        bandwidth. Furthermore, an IMPORTANT I/O request may bypass a previously
        issued throttleable I/O request in kernel or driver queues and be sent
        to the device first. In some circumstances, very large throttleable I/O
        requests will be broken into smaller requests which are then issued
        serially.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The I/O policy of a newly created process is inherited from
        its parent process. The I/O policy of an I/O request is the lowest
        priority policy of the current thread and the current process.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>IOPOL_TYPE_VFS_ATIME_UPDATES</dt>
  <dd>This <var class="Fa">iotype</var> lets users change the access time
      updates policy for the files accessed by the current thread or process.
    <p class="Pp">IOPOL_TYPE_VFS_ATIME_UPDATES supports the following values for
        <var class="Fa">policy:</var></p>
    <dl class="Bl-tag">
      <dt>IOPOL_ATIME_UPDATES_OFF</dt>
      <dd>The ATIME_UPDATES_OFF policy turns off access time updation for files
          accessed. This policy is useful for applications which access a large
          number of files to reduce the metadata I/O writes.</dd>
      <dt>IOPOL_ATIME_UPDATES_DEFAULT</dt>
      <dd>This is the default I/O policy for new threads.</dd>
    </dl>
    <p class="Pp">Like with IOPOL_TYPE_DISK, the I/O policy of a newly created
        process is inherited from its parent process. Access time updates are
        turned off if the I/O policy is set to IOPOL_ATIME_UPDATES_OFF for the
        current thread or current process.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>IOPOL_TYPE_VFS_MATERIALIZE_DATALESS_FILES</dt>
  <dd>This <var class="Fa">iotype</var> lets users change the materialization
      policy for dataless files accessed by the current thread or process.
    <p class="Pp">IOPOL_TYPE_VFS_MATERIALIZE_DATALESS_FILES supports the

    <dl class="Bl-tag">
      <dt>IOPOL_MATERIALIZE_DATALESS_FILES_DEFAULT</dt>
      <dd>Selects the default materialization policy. For IOPOL_SCOPE_THREAD,
          all accesses by the current thread will follow the process policy. For
          IOPOL_SCOPE_PROCESS, all accesses will follow the system default
          policy (IOPOL_MATERIALIZE_DATALESS_FILES_OFF).</dd>
      <dt>IOPOL_MATERIALIZE_DATALESS_FILES_OFF</dt>
      <dd>Disables materialization of dataless files by the current thread or
          process.</dd>
      <dt>IOPOL_MATERIALIZE_DATALESS_FILES_ON</dt>
      <dd>Enables materialization of dataless files by the current thread or
          process.</dd>

<p class="Pp">The thread or process with a throttleable I/O policy enabled will
    be generally prevented from having an adverse effect on the throughput or
    latency of higher priority I/Os of other processes. However, there are a few
    considerations that users of the throttleable I/O policies should keep in
    mind:</p>
<p class="Pp">Consider using the <code class="Dv">F_NOCACHE</code>
    <a class="Xr">fcntl(2)</a> command to prevent caching when using a
    throttleable I/O policy. This will reduce contention for available caches
    with IMPORTANT I/O.</p>
<p class="Pp">Large read requests will automatically be broken up into smaller
    requests to avoid stalling IMPORTANT I/O requests. However, due to the
    consistency guarantees provided to contiguous writes, this can not be done
    automatically for large writes. If a thread or process with a throttleable
    I/O policy enabled will be issuing large writes, consider the use of the
    <code class="Dv">F_SINGLE_WRITER</code> <a class="Xr">fcntl(2)</a> command.
    This will indicate to the system that there is only one thread writing to
    the file and allow automatic division of large writes.</p>
<p class="Pp">Write-heavy throttleable I/O workloads may fill a drive's track
    (write) cache. Subsequent higher priority writes must then wait for enough
    of the track cache to be flushed before they can continue. If the writes
    issued as throttleable I/O are small and not contiguous, many seeks may be
    incurred before space is available for a subsequent higher priority write.
    Issuers of throttleable I/O should attempt to issue their writes
    sequentially or to locations in a single small area of the drive (i.e.
    different positions in the same file) to ensure good spacial locality.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <code class="Dv">F_FULLFSYNC</code> <a class="Xr">fcntl(2)</a>
    command can cause very long system-wide IO stalls; use this command only if
    absolutely necessary.</p>
