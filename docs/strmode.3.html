<p class="Pp">The
    <a class="permalink" href="#strmode"><code class="Fn" id="strmode">strmode</code></a>()
    function converts a file <var class="Fa">mode</var> (the type and permission
    information associated with an inode, see <a class="Xr">stat(2)</a>) into a
    symbolic string which is stored in the location referenced by
    <var class="Fa">bp</var>. This stored string is eleven characters in length
    plus a trailing <code class="Dv">NUL</code>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The first character is the inode type, and will be one of the
    following:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag Bl-compact">
  <dt>-</dt>
  <dd>regular file</dd>
  <dt>b</dt>

  <dd>socket</dd>
  <dt>w</dt>
  <dd>whiteout</dd>
  <dt>?</dt>
  <dd>unknown inode type</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The next nine characters encode three sets of permissions, in
    three characters each. The first three characters are the permissions for
    the owner of the file, the second three for the group the file belongs to,
    and the third for the ``other'', or default, set of users.</p>
<p class="Pp">Permission checking is done as specifically as possible. If read
    permission is denied to the owner of a file in the first set of permissions,
    the owner of the file will not be able to read the file. This is true even
    if the owner is in the file's group and the group permissions allow reading
    or the ``other'' permissions allow reading.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the first character of the three character set is an ``r'', the
    file is readable for that set of users; if a dash ``-'', it is not
  readable.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the second character of the three character set is a ``w'', the
    file is writable for that set of users; if a dash ``-'', it is not
  writable.</p>
<p class="Pp">The third character is the first of the following characters that
    apply:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>S</dt>
  <dd>If the character is part of the owner permissions and the file is not
      executable or the directory is not searchable by the owner, and the
      set-user-id bit is set.</dd>
  <dt>S</dt>
  <dd>If the character is part of the group permissions and the file is not
      executable or the directory is not searchable by the group, and the
      set-group-id bit is set.</dd>
  <dt>T</dt>
  <dd>If the character is part of the other permissions and the file is not
      executable or the directory is not searchable by others, and the
      ``sticky'' (<code class="Dv">S_ISVTX</code>) bit is set.</dd>
  <dt>s</dt>
  <dd>If the character is part of the owner permissions and the file is
      executable or the directory searchable by the owner, and the set-user-id
      bit is set.</dd>
  <dt>s</dt>
  <dd>If the character is part of the group permissions and the file is
      executable or the directory searchable by the group, and the set-group-id
      bit is set.</dd>
  <dt>t</dt>
  <dd>If the character is part of the other permissions and the file is
      executable or the directory searchable by others, and the ``sticky''
      (<code class="Dv">S_ISVTX</code>) bit is set.</dd>
  <dt>x</dt>
  <dd>The file is executable or the directory is searchable.</dd>
  <dt>-</dt>
  <dd>None of the above apply.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The last character will always be a space.</p>
