term - conventions for naming terminal types

The environment variable <b>TERM</b> should normally contain the type name of
  the terminal, console or display-device type you are using. This information
  is critical for all screen-oriented programs, including your editor and
  mailer.
<p class="Pp">A default <b>TERM</b> value will be set on a per-line basis by
    either <b>/etc/inittab</b> (Linux and System-V-like UNIXes) or
    <b>/etc/ttys</b> (BSD UNIXes). This will nearly always suffice for
    workstation and microcomputer consoles.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you use a dialup line, the type of device attached to it may
    vary. Older UNIX systems pre-set a very dumb terminal type like `dumb' or
    `dialup' on dialup lines. Newer ones may pre-set `vt100', reflecting the
    prevalence of DEC VT100-compatible terminals and personal-computer
    emulators.</p>
<p class="Pp">Modern telnets pass your <b>TERM</b> environment variable from the
    local side to the remote one. There can be problems if the remote terminfo
    or termcap entry for your type is not compatible with yours, but this
    situation is rare and can almost always be avoided by explicitly exporting
    `vt100' (assuming you are in fact using a VT100-superset console, terminal,
    or terminal emulator.)</p>
<p class="Pp">In any case, you are free to override the system <b>TERM</b>
    setting to your taste in your shell profile. The <b>tset</b>(1) utility may
    be of assistance; you can give it a set of rules for deducing or requesting
    a terminal type based on the tty device and baud rate.</p>
<p class="Pp">Setting your own <b>TERM</b> value may also be useful if you have
    created a custom entry incorporating options (such as visual bell or
    reverse-video) which you wish to override the system default type for your
    line.</p>
<p class="Pp">Terminal type descriptions are stored as files of capability data
    underneath /usr/share/terminfo. To browse a list of all terminal names
    recognized by the system, do</p>
<p class="Pp">	toe | more</p>
<p class="Pp">from your shell. These capability files are in a binary format
    optimized for retrieval speed (unlike the old text-based <b>termcap</b>
    format they replace); to examine an entry, you must use the
    <b>infocmp</b>(1M) command. Invoke it as follows:</p>
<p class="Pp">	infocmp <i>entry-name</i></p>
<p class="Pp">where <i>entry-name</i> is the name of the type you wish to
    examine (and the name of its capability file the subdirectory of
    /usr/share/terminfo named for its first letter). This command dumps a
    capability file in the text format described by <b>terminfo</b>(5).</p>
<p class="Pp">The first line of a <b>terminfo</b>(5) description gives the names
    by which terminfo knows a terminal, separated by `|' (pipe-bar) characters
    with the last name field terminated by a comma. The first name field is the
    type's <i>primary name</i>, and is the one to use when setting <b>TERM</b>.
    The last name field (if distinct from the first) is actually a description
    of the terminal type (it may contain blanks; the others must be single
    words). Name fields between the first and last (if present) are aliases for
    the terminal, usually historical names retained for compatibility.</p>
<p class="Pp">There are some conventions for how to choose terminal primary
    names that help keep them informative and unique. Here is a step-by-step
    guide to naming terminals that also explains how to parse them:</p>
<p class="Pp">First, choose a root name. The root will consist of a lower-case
    letter followed by up to seven lower-case letters or digits. You need to
    avoid using punctuation characters in root names, because they are used and
    interpreted as filenames and shell meta-characters (such as !, $, *, ?,
    etc.) embedded in them may cause odd and unhelpful behavior. The slash (/),
    or any other character that may be interpreted by anyone's file system (\,
    $, [, ]), is especially dangerous (terminfo is platform-independent, and
    choosing names with special characters could someday make life difficult for
    users of a future port). The dot (.) character is relatively safe as long as
    there is at most one per root name; some historical terminfo names use
  it.</p>
<p class="Pp">The root name for a terminal or workstation console type should
    almost always begin with a vendor prefix (such as <b>hp</b> for
    Hewlett-Packard, <b>wy</b> for Wyse, or <b>att</b> for AT&amp;T terminals),
    or a common name of the terminal line (<b>vt</b> for the VT series of
    terminals from DEC, or <b>sun</b> for Sun Microsystems workstation consoles,
    or <b>regent</b> for the ADDS Regent series. You can list the terminfo tree
    to see what prefixes are already in common use. The root name prefix should
    be followed when appropriate by a model number; thus <b>vt100</b>,
    <b>hp2621</b>, <b>wy50</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The root name for a PC-Unix console type should be the OS name,
    i.e. <b>linux</b>, <b>bsdos</b>, <b>freebsd</b>, <b>netbsd</b>. It should
    <i>not</i> be <b>console</b> or any other generic that might cause confusion
    in a multi-platform environment! If a model number follows, it should
    indicate either the OS release level or the console driver release
  level.</p>
<p class="Pp">The root name for a terminal emulator (assuming it does not fit
    one of the standard ANSI or vt100 types) should be the program name or a
    readily recognizable abbreviation of it (i.e. <b>versaterm</b>,
    <b>ctrm</b>).</p>
<p class="Pp">Following the root name, you may add any reasonable number of
    hyphen-separated feature suffixes.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>2p</dt>
  <dd>Has two pages of memory. Likewise 4p, 8p, etc.</dd>
  <dt>mc</dt>
  <dd>Magic-cookie. Some terminals (notably older Wyses) can only support one
      attribute without magic-cookie lossage. Their base entry is usually paired
      with another that has this suffix and uses magic cookies to support
      multiple attributes.</dd>
  <dt>-am</dt>
  <dd>Enable auto-margin (right-margin wraparound).</dd>
  <dt>-m</dt>
  <dd>Mono mode - suppress color support.</dd>
  <dt>-na</dt>
  <dd>No arrow keys - termcap ignores arrow keys which are actually there on the
      terminal, so the user can use the arrow keys locally.</dd>
  <dt>-nam</dt>
  <dd>No auto-margin - suppress am capability.</dd>
  <dt>-nl</dt>
  <dd>No labels - suppress soft labels.</dd>
  <dt>-nsl</dt>
  <dd>No status line - suppress status line.</dd>
  <dt>-pp</dt>
  <dd>Has a printer port which is used.</dd>
  <dt>-rv</dt>
  <dd>Terminal in reverse video mode (black on white).</dd>
  <dt>-s</dt>
  <dd>Enable status line.</dd>
  <dt>-vb</dt>
  <dd>Use visible bell (flash) rather than beep.</dd>
  <dt>-w</dt>
  <dd>Wide; terminal is in 132 column mode.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Conventionally, if your terminal type is a variant intended to
    specify a line height, that suffix should go first. So, for a hypothetical
    FuBarCo model 2317 terminal in 30-line mode with reverse video, best form
    would be <b>fubar-30-rv</b> (rather than, say, `fubar-rv-30').</p>
<p class="Pp">Terminal types that are written not as standalone entries, but
    rather as components to be plugged into other entries via <b>use</b>
    capabilities, are distinguished by using embedded plus signs rather than
    dashes.</p>
<p class="Pp">Commands which use a terminal type to control display often accept
    a -T option that accepts a terminal name argument. Such programs should fall
    back on the <b>TERM</b> environment variable when no -T option is
  specified.</p>

For maximum compatibility with older System V UNIXes, names and aliases should
