<p class="Pp">The archive table-of-contents command
    <code class="Nm">ranlib</code> creates a table of contents for archives,
    containing object files, to be used by the link-editor
    <a class="Xr">ld(1)</a>. It operates on archives created with the utility
    <a class="Xr">ar(1)</a>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <code class="Nm">Ranlib</code> function prepends a new file to
    the archive which has three separate parts. The first part is a standard
    archive header, which has a special name field, &quot;__.SYMDEF&quot; or
    &quot;__.SYMDEF SORTED&quot;. If the archive does not have multiple members
    that define symbol then &quot;__.SYMDEF SORTED&quot; should be used and the
    table of contents should be sorted by name.</p>
<p class="Pp">The second part is a ``long'' followed by a list of ranlib
    structures. The long is the size, in bytes, of the list of ranlib
    structures. Each of the ranlib structures consists of a zero based offset
    into the next section (a string table of symbols) and an offset from the
    beginning of the archive to the start of the archive file which defines the
    symbol. The actual number of ranlib structures is this number divided by the
    size of an individual ranlib structure.</p>
<p class="Pp">The third part is a ``long'' followed by a string table. The long
    is the size, in bytes of the string table.</p>
