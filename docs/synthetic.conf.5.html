<p class="Pp"><code class="Nm">synthetic.conf</code> describes virtual symbolic
    links and empty directories to be created at the root mount point. Because
    the root mount point is read-only as of macOS 10.15, physical files may not
    be created at this location. All writeable paths must reside on the data
    volume, which is mounted at
    <a class="permalink" href="#/System/Volumes/Data"><i class="Em" id="/System/Volumes/Data">/System/Volumes/Data</i></a>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><code class="Nm">synthetic.conf</code> provides a mechanism for
    some limited, user-controlled file-creation at <i class="Em">/</i>. The
    synthetic entities described in this file are synthesized by the kernel
    during early system boot. They are not physically present on the disk, but
    when the system is booted, they behave as if they were within certain
    parameters.</p>
<p class="Pp"><code class="Nm">synthetic.conf</code> is intended to be used for
    creating mount points at <i class="Em">/</i> (e.g. for use as NFS mount
    points in enterprise deployments) and symbolic links (e.g. for creating a
    package manager root without modifying the system volume).
    <code class="Nm">synthetic.conf</code> is read by
    <a class="Xr">apfs.util(8)</a> during early system boot.</p>

<p class="Pp">Individual subsystems may add their own synthetic manifests to
    <a class="permalink" href="#/etc/synthetic.d"><i class="Em" id="/etc/synthetic.d">/etc/synthetic.d</i></a>
    to avoid having to append to the content of
    <code class="Nm">synthetic.conf</code>. This is similar to the mechanisms
    which exist for shell and manual page paths,
    <a class="permalink" href="#paths.d"><i class="Em" id="paths.d">paths.d</i></a>
    and
    <a class="permalink" href="#manpaths.d"><i class="Em" id="manpaths.d">manpaths.d</i></a>,
    respectively. If multiple manifests specify the same synthetic link or
    directory name, the one respected by the implementation is undefined. The
    structure of these manifests is identical to that of
    <code class="Nm">synthetic.conf</code>.</p>

<p class="Pp"><code class="Nm">synthetic.conf</code> specifies a single
    synthetic entity per line. Each line may have one or two columns, separated
    by a tab character. If a line has a single column, it denotes a virtual
    empty directory to be created at <i class="Em">/</i>. If a line has two
    columns, it denotes a symbolic link at / whose link target is given in the
    second column.</p>
<p class="Pp">In either case, the first column denotes the name of the entity to
    be created at <i class="Em">/</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp" id="_">A line beginning with the
    <a class="permalink" href="#_"><i class="Em">#</i></a> character indicates a
