<p class="Pp">Updates remote refs using local refs, while sending objects
    necessary to complete the given refs.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can make interesting things happen to a repository every time
    you push into it, by setting up <i>hooks</i> there. See documentation for
    <b>git-receive-pack</b>(1).</p>
<p class="Pp">When the command line does not specify where to push with the
    <i>&lt;repository&gt;</i> argument, <b>branch.*.remote</b> configuration for
    the current branch is consulted to determine where to push. If the
    configuration is missing, it defaults to <i>origin</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">When the command line does not specify what to push with
    <i>&lt;refspec&gt;</i>... arguments or <b>--all</b>, <b>--mirror</b>,
    <b>--tags</b> options, the command finds the default <i>&lt;refspec&gt;</i>
    by consulting <b>remote.*.push</b> configuration, and if it is not found,
    honors <b>push.default</b> configuration to decide what to push (See
    <b>git-config</b>(1) for the meaning of <b>push.default</b>).</p>
<p class="Pp">When neither the command-line nor the configuration specifies what
    to push, the default behavior is used, which corresponds to the
    <b>simple</b> value for <b>push.default</b>: the current branch is pushed to
    the corresponding upstream branch, but as a safety measure, the push is
    aborted if the upstream branch does not have the same name as the local
  one.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">&lt;repository&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The &quot;remote&quot; repository that is the destination
  of a push operation. This parameter can be either a URL (see the section GIT
  URLS below) or the name of a remote (see the section REMOTES below).</div>
<p class="Pp">&lt;refspec&gt;...</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Specify what destination ref to update with what source
  object. The format of a &lt;refspec&gt; parameter is an optional plus
  <b>+</b>, followed by the source object &lt;src&gt;, followed by a colon
  <b>:</b>, followed by the destination ref &lt;dst&gt;.
<p class="Pp">The &lt;src&gt; is often the name of the branch you would want to
    push, but it can be any arbitrary &quot;SHA-1 expression&quot;, such as
    <b>master~4</b> or <b>HEAD</b> (see <b>gitrevisions</b>(7)).</p>
<p class="Pp">The &lt;dst&gt; tells which ref on the remote side is updated with
    this push. Arbitrary expressions cannot be used here, an actual ref must be
    named. If <b>git</b> <b>push</b> [<i>&lt;repository&gt;</i>] without any
    <i>&lt;refspec&gt;</i> argument is set to update some ref at the destination
    with <i>&lt;src&gt;</i> with
    <b>remote.</b><i>&lt;repository&gt;</i><b>.push</b> configuration variable,
    <b>:</b><i>&lt;dst&gt;</i> part can be omitted&#x2014;such a push will
    update a ref that <i>&lt;src&gt;</i> normally updates without any
    <i>&lt;refspec&gt;</i> on the command line. Otherwise, missing
    <b>:</b><i>&lt;dst&gt;</i> means to update the same ref as the
    <i>&lt;src&gt;</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">If &lt;dst&gt; doesn&#x2019;t start with <b>refs/</b> (e.g.
    <b>refs/heads/master</b>) we will try to infer where in <b>refs/*</b> on the
    destination &lt;repository&gt; it belongs based on the type of &lt;src&gt;
    being pushed and whether &lt;dst&gt; is ambiguous.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;If &lt;dst&gt; unambiguously refers to a ref on
  the &lt;repository&gt; remote, then push to that ref.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;If &lt;src&gt; resolves to a ref starting with
  refs/heads/ or refs/tags/, then prepend that to &lt;dst&gt;.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Other ambiguity resolutions might be added in the
  future, but for now any other cases will error out with an error indicating
  what we tried, and depending on the <b>advice.pushUnqualifiedRefname</b>
  configuration (see <b>git-config</b>(1)) suggest what refs/ namespace you may
  have wanted to push to.</div>
<p class="Pp">The object referenced by &lt;src&gt; is used to update the
    &lt;dst&gt; reference on the remote side. Whether this is allowed depends on
    where in <b>refs/*</b> the &lt;dst&gt; reference lives as described in
    detail below, in those sections &quot;update&quot; means any modifications
    except deletes, which as noted after the next few sections are treated
    differently.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>refs/heads/*</b> namespace will only accept commit objects,
    and updates only if they can be fast-forwarded.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>refs/tags/*</b> namespace will accept any kind of object
    (as commits, trees and blobs can be tagged), and any updates to them will be
    rejected.</p>
<p class="Pp">It&#x2019;s possible to push any type of object to any namespace
    outside of <b>refs/</b>{tags,heads}/*. In the case of tags and commits,
    these will be treated as if they were the commits inside <b>refs/heads/*</b>
    for the purposes of whether the update is allowed.</p>
<p class="Pp">I.e. a fast-forward of commits and tags outside
    <b>refs/</b>{tags,heads}/* is allowed, even in cases where what&#x2019;s
    being fast-forwarded is not a commit, but a tag object which happens to
    point to a new commit which is a fast-forward of the commit the last tag (or
    commit) it&#x2019;s replacing. Replacing a tag with an entirely different
    tag is also allowed, if it points to the same commit, as well as pushing a
    peeled tag, i.e. pushing the commit that existing tag object points to, or a
    new tag object which an existing commit points to.</p>
<p class="Pp">Tree and blob objects outside of <b>refs/</b>{tags,heads}/* will
    be treated the same way as if they were inside <b>refs/tags/*</b>, any
    update of them will be rejected.</p>
<p class="Pp">All of the rules described above about what&#x2019;s not allowed
    as an update can be overridden by adding an the optional leading <b>+</b> to
    a refspec (or using <b>--force</b> command line option). The only exception
    to this is that no amount of forcing will make the <b>refs/heads/*</b>
    namespace accept a non-commit object. Hooks and configuration can also
    override or amend these rules, see e.g. <b>receive.denyNonFastForwards</b>
    in <b>git-config</b>(1) and <b>pre-receive</b> and <b>update</b> in
    <b>githooks</b>(5).</p>
<p class="Pp">Pushing an empty &lt;src&gt; allows you to delete the &lt;dst&gt;
    ref from the remote repository. Deletions are always accepted without a
    leading <b>+</b> in the refspec (or <b>--force</b>), except when forbidden
    by configuration or hooks. See <b>receive.denyDeletes</b> in
    <b>git-config</b>(1) and <b>pre-receive</b> and <b>update</b> in
    <b>githooks</b>(5).</p>
<p class="Pp">The special refspec <b>:</b> (or <b>+:</b> to allow
    non-fast-forward updates) directs Git to push &quot;matching&quot; branches:
    for every branch that exists on the local side, the remote side is updated
    if a branch of the same name already exists on the remote side.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>tag</b> <i>&lt;tag&gt;</i> means the same as
    <b>refs/tags/</b><i>&lt;tag&gt;</i><b>:refs/tags/</b><i>&lt;tag&gt;</i>.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--all, --branches</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Push all branches (i.e. refs under <b>refs/heads/</b>);
  cannot be used with other &lt;refspec&gt;.</div>
<p class="Pp">--prune</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Remove remote branches that don&#x2019;t have a local
  counterpart. For example a remote branch <b>tmp</b> will be removed if a local
  branch with the same name doesn&#x2019;t exist any more. This also respects
  refspecs, e.g. <b>git</b> <b>push</b> <b>--prune</b> <b>remote</b>
  <b>refs/heads/*:refs/tmp/*</b> would make sure that remote <b>refs/tmp/foo</b>
  will be removed if <b>refs/heads/foo</b> doesn&#x2019;t exist.</div>
<p class="Pp">--mirror</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Instead of naming each ref to push, specifies that all
  refs under <b>refs/</b> (which includes but is not limited to
  <b>refs/heads/</b>, <b>refs/remotes/</b>, and <b>refs/tags/</b>) be mirrored
  to the remote repository. Newly created local refs will be pushed to the
  remote end, locally updated refs will be force updated on the remote end, and
  deleted refs will be removed from the remote end. This is the default if the
  configuration option <b>remote.</b><i>&lt;remote&gt;</i><b>.mirror</b> is
  set.</div>
<p class="Pp">-n, --dry-run</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Do everything except actually send the updates.</div>
<p class="Pp">--porcelain</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Produce machine-readable output. The output status line
  for each ref will be tab-separated and sent to stdout instead of stderr. The
  full symbolic names of the refs will be given.</div>
<p class="Pp">-d, --delete</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">All listed refs are deleted from the remote repository.
  This is the same as prefixing all refs with a colon.</div>
<p class="Pp">--tags</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">All refs under <b>refs/tags</b> are pushed, in addition
  to refspecs explicitly listed on the command line.</div>
<p class="Pp">--follow-tags</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Push all the refs that would be pushed without this
  option, and also push annotated tags in <b>refs/tags</b> that are missing from
  the remote but are pointing at commit-ish that are reachable from the refs
  being pushed. This can also be specified with configuration variable
  <b>push.followTags</b>. For more information, see <b>push.followTags</b> in
  <b>git-config</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">--[no-]signed, --signed=(true|false|if-asked)</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">GPG-sign the push request to update refs on the receiving
  side, to allow it to be checked by the hooks and/or be logged. If <b>false</b>
  or <b>--no-signed</b>, no signing will be attempted. If <b>true</b> or
  <b>--signed</b>, the push will fail if the server does not support signed
  pushes. If set to <b>if-asked</b>, sign if and only if the server supports
  signed pushes. The push will also fail if the actual call to <b>gpg</b>
  <b>--sign</b> fails. See <b>git-receive-pack</b>(1) for the details on the
  receiving end.</div>
<p class="Pp">--[no-]atomic</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Use an atomic transaction on the remote side if
  available. Either all refs are updated, or on error, no refs are updated. If
  the server does not support atomic pushes the push will fail.</div>
<p class="Pp">-o &lt;option&gt;, --push-option=&lt;option&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Transmit the given string to the server, which passes
  them to the pre-receive as well as the post-receive hook. The given string
  must not contain a NUL or LF character. When multiple
  <b>--push-option=</b><i>&lt;option&gt;</i> are given, they are all sent to the
  other side in the order listed on the command line. When no
  <b>--push-option=</b><i>&lt;option&gt;</i> is given from the command line, the
  values of configuration variable <b>push.pushOption</b> are used
  instead.</div>
<p class="Pp">--receive-pack=&lt;git-receive-pack&gt;,
    --exec=&lt;git-receive-pack&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Path to the <i>git-receive-pack</i> program on the remote
  end. Sometimes useful when pushing to a remote repository over ssh, and you do
  not have the program in a directory on the default $PATH.</div>
<p class="Pp">--[no-]force-with-lease, --force-with-lease=&lt;refname&gt;,
    --force-with-lease=&lt;refname&gt;:&lt;expect&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Usually, &quot;git push&quot; refuses to update a remote
  ref that is not an ancestor of the local ref used to overwrite it.
<p class="Pp">This option overrides this restriction if the current value of the
    remote ref is the expected value. &quot;git push&quot; fails otherwise.</p>
<p class="Pp">Imagine that you have to rebase what you have already published.
    You will have to bypass the &quot;must fast-forward&quot; rule in order to
    replace the history you originally published with the rebased history. If
    somebody else built on top of your original history while you are rebasing,
    the tip of the branch at the remote may advance with their commit, and
    blindly pushing with <b>--force</b> will lose their work.</p>
<p class="Pp">This option allows you to say that you expect the history you are
    updating is what you rebased and want to replace. If the remote ref still
    points at the commit you specified, you can be sure that no other people did
    anything to the ref. It is like taking a &quot;lease&quot; on the ref
    without explicitly locking it, and the remote ref is updated only if the
    &quot;lease&quot; is still valid.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>--force-with-lease</b> alone, without specifying the details,
    will protect all remote refs that are going to be updated by requiring their
    current value to be the same as the remote-tracking branch we have for
  them.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>--force-with-lease=</b><i>&lt;refname&gt;</i>, without
    specifying the expected value, will protect the named ref (alone), if it is
    going to be updated, by requiring its current value to be the same as the
    remote-tracking branch we have for it.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>--force-with-lease=</b><i>&lt;refname&gt;</i><b>:</b><i>&lt;expect&gt;</i>
    will protect the named ref (alone), if it is going to be updated, by
    requiring its current value to be the same as the specified value
    <i>&lt;expect&gt;</i> (which is allowed to be different from the
    remote-tracking branch we have for the refname, or we do not even have to
    have such a remote-tracking branch when this form is used). If
    <i>&lt;expect&gt;</i> is the empty string, then the named ref must not
    already exist.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that all forms other than
    <b>--force-with-lease=</b><i>&lt;refname&gt;</i><b>:</b><i>&lt;expect&gt;</i>
    that specifies the expected current value of the ref explicitly are still
    experimental and their semantics may change as we gain experience with this
    feature.</p>
<p class="Pp">&quot;--no-force-with-lease&quot; will cancel all the previous
    --force-with-lease on the command line.</p>
<p class="Pp">A general note on safety: supplying this option without an
    expected value, i.e. as <b>--force-with-lease</b> or
    <b>--force-with-lease=</b><i>&lt;refname&gt;</i> interacts very badly with
    anything that implicitly runs <b>git</b> <b>fetch</b> on the remote to be
    pushed to in the background, e.g. <b>git</b> <b>fetch</b> <b>origin</b> on
    your repository in a cronjob.</p>
<p class="Pp">The protection it offers over <b>--force</b> is ensuring that
    subsequent changes your work wasn&#x2019;t based on aren&#x2019;t clobbered,
    but this is trivially defeated if some background process is updating refs
    in the background. We don&#x2019;t have anything except the remote tracking
    info to go by as a heuristic for refs you&#x2019;re expected to have seen
    &amp; are willing to clobber.</p>
<p class="Pp">If your editor or some other system is running <b>git</b>
    <b>fetch</b> in the background for you a way to mitigate this is to simply
    set up another remote:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>git remote add origin-push $(git config remote.origin.url)
git fetch origin-push</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Now when the background process runs <b>git</b> <b>fetch</b>
    <b>origin</b> the references on <b>origin-push</b> won&#x2019;t be updated,
    and thus commands like:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>git push --force-with-lease origin-push</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Will fail unless you manually run <b>git</b> <b>fetch</b>
    <b>origin-push</b>. This method is of course entirely defeated by something
    that runs <b>git</b> <b>fetch</b> <b>--all</b>, in that case you&#x2019;d
    need to either disable it or do something more tedious like:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>git fetch              # update 'master' from remote
git tag base master    # mark our base point
git rebase -i master   # rewrite some commits
git push --force-with-lease=master:base master:master</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">I.e. create a <b>base</b> tag for versions of the upstream code
    that you&#x2019;ve seen and are willing to overwrite, then rewrite history,
    and finally force push changes to <b>master</b> if the remote version is
    still at <b>base</b>, regardless of what your local
    <b>remotes/origin/master</b> has been updated to in the background.</p>
<p class="Pp">Alternatively, specifying <b>--force-if-includes</b> as an
    ancillary option along with
    <b>--force-with-lease</b>[<b>=</b><i>&lt;refname&gt;</i>] (i.e., without
    saying what exact commit the ref on the remote side must be pointing at, or
    which refs on the remote side are being protected) at the time of
    &quot;push&quot; will verify if updates from the remote-tracking refs that
    may have been implicitly updated in the background are integrated locally
    before allowing a forced update.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">-f, --force</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Usually, the command refuses to update a remote ref that
  is not an ancestor of the local ref used to overwrite it. Also, when
  <b>--force-with-lease</b> option is used, the command refuses to update a
  remote ref whose current value does not match what is expected.
<p class="Pp">This flag disables these checks, and can cause the remote
    repository to lose commits; use it with care.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that <b>--force</b> applies to all the refs that are pushed,
    hence using it with <b>push.default</b> set to <b>matching</b> or with
    multiple push destinations configured with <b>remote.*.push</b> may
    overwrite refs other than the current branch (including local refs that are
    strictly behind their remote counterpart). To force a push to only one
    branch, use a <b>+</b> in front of the refspec to push (e.g <b>git</b>
    <b>push</b> <b>origin</b> <b>+master</b> to force a push to the
    <b>master</b> branch). See the <i>&lt;refspec&gt;</i>... section above for
    details.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--[no-]force-if-includes</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Force an update only if the tip of the remote-tracking
  ref has been integrated locally.
<p class="Pp">This option enables a check that verifies if the tip of the
    remote-tracking ref is reachable from one of the &quot;reflog&quot; entries
    of the local branch based in it for a rewrite. The check ensures that any
    updates from the remote have been incorporated locally by rejecting the
    forced update if that is not the case.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the option is passed without specifying
    <b>--force-with-lease</b>, or specified along with
    <b>--force-with-lease=</b><i>&lt;refname&gt;</i><b>:</b><i>&lt;expect&gt;</i>,
    it is a &quot;no-op&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">Specifying <b>--no-force-if-includes</b> disables this
  behavior.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--repo=&lt;repository&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This option is equivalent to the &lt;repository&gt;
  argument. If both are specified, the command-line argument takes
  precedence.</div>
<p class="Pp">-u, --set-upstream</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">For every branch that is up to date or successfully
  pushed, add upstream (tracking) reference, used by argument-less
  <b>git-pull</b>(1) and other commands. For more information, see
  <b>branch.</b><i>&lt;name&gt;</i><b>.merge</b> in <b>git-config</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">--[no-]thin</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">These options are passed to <b>git-send-pack</b>(1). A
  thin transfer significantly reduces the amount of sent data when the sender
  and receiver share many of the same objects in common. The default is
  <b>--thin</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">-q, --quiet</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Suppress all output, including the listing of updated
  refs, unless an error occurs. Progress is not reported to the standard error
  stream.</div>
<p class="Pp">-v, --verbose</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Run verbosely.</div>
<p class="Pp">--progress</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Progress status is reported on the standard error stream
  by default when it is attached to a terminal, unless -q is specified. This
  flag forces progress status even if the standard error stream is not directed
  to a terminal.</div>
<p class="Pp">--no-recurse-submodules,
    --recurse-submodules=check|on-demand|only|no</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">May be used to make sure all submodule commits used by
  the revisions to be pushed are available on a remote-tracking branch. If
  <i>check</i> is used Git will verify that all submodule commits that changed
  in the revisions to be pushed are available on at least one remote of the
  submodule. If any commits are missing the push will be aborted and exit with
  non-zero status. If <i>on-demand</i> is used all submodules that changed in
  the revisions to be pushed will be pushed. If on-demand was not able to push
  all necessary revisions it will also be aborted and exit with non-zero status.
  If <i>only</i> is used all submodules will be pushed while the superproject is
  left unpushed. A value of <i>no</i> or using <b>--no-recurse-submodules</b>
  can be used to override the push.recurseSubmodules configuration variable when
  no submodule recursion is required.
<p class="Pp">When using <i>on-demand</i> or <i>only</i>, if a submodule has a
    &quot;push.recurseSubmodules={on-demand,only}&quot; or
    &quot;submodule.recurse&quot; configuration, further recursion will occur.
    In this case, &quot;only&quot; is treated as &quot;on-demand&quot;.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--[no-]verify</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Toggle the pre-push hook (see <b>githooks</b>(5)). The
  default is --verify, giving the hook a chance to prevent the push. With
  --no-verify, the hook is bypassed completely.</div>
<p class="Pp">-4, --ipv4</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Use IPv4 addresses only, ignoring IPv6 addresses.</div>

  URLS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">In general, URLs contain information about the transport protocol,
    the address of the remote server, and the path to the repository. Depending
    on the transport protocol, some of this information may be absent.</p>
<p class="Pp">Git supports ssh, git, http, and https protocols (in addition, ftp
    and ftps can be used for fetching, but this is inefficient and deprecated;
    do not use them).</p>
<p class="Pp">The native transport (i.e. <b>git://</b> URL) does no
    authentication and should be used with caution on unsecured networks.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following syntaxes may be used with them:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>ssh://</b>[<i>&lt;user&gt;</i><b>@</b>]<i>&lt;host&gt;</i>[<b>:</b><i>&lt;port&gt;</i>]<b>/</b><i>&lt;path-to-git-repo&gt;</i></div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>git://</b><i>&lt;host&gt;</i>[<b>:</b><i>&lt;port&gt;</i>]<b>/</b><i>&lt;path-to-git-repo&gt;</i></div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>http</b>[<b>s</b>]<b>://</b><i>&lt;host&gt;</i>[<b>:</b><i>&lt;port&gt;</i>]<b>/</b><i>&lt;path-to-git-repo&gt;</i></div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>ftp</b>[<b>s</b>]<b>://</b><i>&lt;host&gt;</i>[<b>:</b><i>&lt;port&gt;</i>]<b>/</b><i>&lt;path-to-git-repo&gt;</i></div>
<p class="Pp">An alternative scp-like syntax may also be used with the ssh
    protocol:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;[<i>&lt;user&gt;</i><b>@</b>]<i>&lt;host&gt;</i><b>:/</b><i>&lt;path-to-git-repo&gt;</i></div>
<p class="Pp">This syntax is only recognized if there are no slashes before the
    first colon. This helps differentiate a local path that contains a colon.
    For example the local path <b>foo:bar</b> could be specified as an absolute
    path or .<b>/foo:bar</b> to avoid being misinterpreted as an ssh url.</p>
<p class="Pp">The ssh and git protocols additionally support
    <b>~</b><i>&lt;username&gt;</i> expansion:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>ssh://</b>[<i>&lt;user&gt;</i><b>@</b>]<i>&lt;host&gt;</i>[<b>:</b><i>&lt;port&gt;</i>]<b>/~</b><i>&lt;user&gt;</i><b>/</b><i>&lt;path-to-git-repo&gt;</i></div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>git://</b><i>&lt;host&gt;</i>[<b>:</b><i>&lt;port&gt;</i>]<b>/~</b><i>&lt;user&gt;</i><b>/</b><i>&lt;path-to-git-repo&gt;</i></div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;[<i>&lt;user&gt;</i><b>@</b>]<i>&lt;host&gt;</i><b>:~</b><i>&lt;user&gt;</i><b>/</b><i>&lt;path-to-git-repo&gt;</i></div>
<p class="Pp">For local repositories, also supported by Git natively, the
    following syntaxes may be used:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>/path/to/repo.git/</b></div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>file:///path/to/repo.git/</b></div>
<p class="Pp">These two syntaxes are mostly equivalent, except when cloning,
    when the former implies <b>--local</b> option. See <b>git-clone</b>(1) for
    details.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>git</b> <b>clone</b>, <b>git</b> <b>fetch</b> and <b>git</b>
    <b>pull</b>, but not <b>git</b> <b>push</b>, will also accept a suitable
    bundle file. See <b>git-bundle</b>(1).</p>
<p class="Pp">When Git doesn&#x2019;t know how to handle a certain transport
    protocol, it attempts to use the <b>remote-</b><i>&lt;transport&gt;</i>
    remote helper, if one exists. To explicitly request a remote helper, the
    following syntax may be used:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<i>&lt;transport&gt;</i><b>::</b><i>&lt;address&gt;</i></div>
<p class="Pp">where <i>&lt;address&gt;</i> may be a path, a server and path, or
    an arbitrary URL-like string recognized by the specific remote helper being
    invoked. See <b>gitremote-helpers</b>(7) for details.</p>
<p class="Pp">If there are a large number of similarly-named remote repositories
    and you want to use a different format for them (such that the URLs you use
    will be rewritten into URLs that work), you can create a configuration
    section of the form:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<br/>
        [url &quot;<i>&lt;actual-url-base&gt;</i>&quot;]
<br/>
                insteadOf = <i>&lt;other-url-base&gt;</i></pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">For example, with this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<br/>
        [url &quot;git://git.host.xz/&quot;]
<br/>
                insteadOf = host.xz:/path/to/
<br/>
                insteadOf = work:</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">a URL like &quot;work:repo.git&quot; or like
    &quot;host.xz:/path/to/repo.git&quot; will be rewritten in any context that
    takes a URL to be &quot;git://git.host.xz/repo.git&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you want to rewrite URLs for push only, you can create a
    configuration section of the form:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<br/>
        [url &quot;<i>&lt;actual-url-base&gt;</i>&quot;]
<br/>
                pushInsteadOf = <i>&lt;other-url-base&gt;</i></pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">For example, with this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<br/>
        [url &quot;ssh://example.org/&quot;]
<br/>
                pushInsteadOf = git://example.org/</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">a URL like &quot;git://example.org/path/to/repo.git&quot; will be
    rewritten to &quot;ssh://example.org/path/to/repo.git&quot; for pushes, but
    pulls will still use the original URL.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="REMOTES"><a class="permalink" href="#REMOTES">REMOTES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The name of one of the following can be used instead of a URL as
    <i>&lt;repository&gt;</i> argument:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;a remote in the Git configuration file:

<p class="Pp">The <i>&lt;pushurl&gt;</i> is used for pushes only. It is optional
    and defaults to <i>&lt;URL&gt;</i>. Pushing to a remote affects all defined

<h1 class="Sh" id="NOTE_ABOUT_FAST"><a class="permalink" href="#NOTE_ABOUT_FAST">NOTE
  ABOUT FAST-FORWARDS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">When an update changes a branch (or more in general, a ref) that
    used to point at commit A to point at another commit B, it is called a
    fast-forward update if and only if B is a descendant of A.</p>
<p class="Pp">In a fast-forward update from A to B, the set of commits that the
    original commit A built on top of is a subset of the commits the new commit
    B builds on top of. Hence, it does not lose any history.</p>
<p class="Pp">In contrast, a non-fast-forward update will lose history. For
    example, suppose you and somebody else started at the same commit X, and you
    built a history leading to commit B while the other person built a history
    leading to commit A. The history looks like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<br/>
      B
<br/>
     /
<br/>
 ---X---A</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Further suppose that the other person already pushed changes
    leading to A back to the original repository from which you two obtained the
    original commit X.</p>
<p class="Pp">The push done by the other person updated the branch that used to
    point at commit X to point at commit A. It is a fast-forward.</p>
<p class="Pp">But if you try to push, you will attempt to update the branch
    (that now points at A) with commit B. This does <i>not</i> fast-forward. If
    you did so, the changes introduced by commit A will be lost, because
    everybody will now start building on top of B.</p>
<p class="Pp">The command by default does not allow an update that is not a
    fast-forward to prevent such loss of history.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you do not want to lose your work (history from X to B) or the
    work by the other person (history from X to A), you would need to first
    fetch the history from the repository, create a history that contains
    changes done by both parties, and push the result back.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can perform &quot;git pull&quot;, resolve potential conflicts,
    and &quot;git push&quot; the result. A &quot;git pull&quot; will create a
    merge commit C between commits A and B.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<br/>
      B---C
<br/>
     /   /
<br/>
 ---X---A</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Updating A with the resulting merge commit will fast-forward and
    your push will be accepted.</p>
<p class="Pp">Alternatively, you can rebase your change between X and B on top
    of A, with &quot;git pull --rebase&quot;, and push the result back. The
    rebase will create a new commit D that builds the change between X and B on
    top of A.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<br/>
      B   D
<br/>
     /   /
<br/>
 ---X---A</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Again, updating A with this commit will fast-forward and your push
    will be accepted.</p>
<p class="Pp">There is another common situation where you may encounter
    non-fast-forward rejection when you try to push, and it is possible even
    when you are pushing into a repository nobody else pushes into. After you
    push commit A yourself (in the first picture in this section), replace it
    with &quot;git commit --amend&quot; to produce commit B, and you try to push
    it out, because forgot that you have pushed A out already. In such a case,
    and only if you are certain that nobody in the meantime fetched your earlier
    commit A (and started building on top of it), you can run &quot;git push
    --force&quot; to overwrite it. In other words, &quot;git push --force&quot;
    is a method reserved for a case where you do mean to lose history.</p>

<p class="Pp">The fetch and push protocols are not designed to prevent one side

    effective for read access control; you should only grant read access to a
    namespace to clients that you would trust with read access to the entire
    repository.</p>
<p class="Pp">The known attack vectors are as follows:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 1.The victim sends &quot;have&quot; lines advertising
  the IDs of objects it has that are not explicitly intended to be shared but
  can be used to optimize the transfer if the peer also has them. The attacker
  chooses an object ID X to steal and sends a ref to X, but isn&#x2019;t
  required to send the content of X because the victim already has it. Now the
  victim believes that the attacker has X, and it sends the content of X back to
  the attacker later. (This attack is most straightforward for a client to
  perform on a server, by creating a ref to X in the namespace the client has
  access to and then fetching it. The most likely way for a server to perform it
  on a client is to &quot;merge&quot; X into a public branch and hope that the
  user does additional work on this branch and pushes it back to the server
  without noticing the merge.)</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 2.As in #1, the attacker chooses an object ID X to
  steal. The victim sends an object Y that the attacker already has, and the
  attacker falsely claims to have X and not Y, so the victim sends Y as a delta
  against X. The delta reveals regions of X that are similar to Y to the
  attacker.</div>

<p class="Pp">Everything below this line in this section is selectively included
    from the <b>git-config</b>(1) documentation. The content is the same as
    what&#x2019;s found there:</p>
<p class="Pp">push.autoSetupRemote</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If set to &quot;true&quot; assume <b>--set-upstream</b>
  on default push when no upstream tracking exists for the current branch; this
  option takes effect with push.default options <i>simple</i>, <i>upstream</i>,
  and <i>current</i>. It is useful if by default you want new branches to be
  pushed to the default remote (like the behavior of
  <i>push.default=current</i>) and you also want the upstream tracking to be
  set. Workflows most likely to benefit from this option are <i>simple</i>
  central workflows where all branches are expected to have the same name on the
  remote.</div>
<p class="Pp">push.default</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Defines the action <b>git</b> <b>push</b> should take if
  no refspec is given (whether from the command-line, config, or elsewhere).
  Different values are well-suited for specific workflows; for instance, in a
  purely central workflow (i.e. the fetch source is equal to the push
  destination), <b>upstream</b> is probably what you want. Possible values are:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>nothing</b> - do not push anything (error out)
  unless a refspec is given. This is primarily meant for people who want to
  avoid mistakes by always being explicit.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>current</b> - push the current branch to
  update a branch with the same name on the receiving end. Works in both central
  and non-central workflows.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>upstream</b> - push the current branch back to
  the branch whose changes are usually integrated into the current branch (which
  is called <b>@</b>{upstream}). This mode only makes sense if you are pushing
  to the same repository you would normally pull from (i.e. central
  workflow).</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>tracking</b> - This is a deprecated synonym
  for <b>upstream</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>simple</b> - push the current branch with the
  same name on the remote.
<p class="Pp">If you are working on a centralized workflow (pushing to the same
    repository you pull from, which is typically <b>origin</b>), then you need
    to configure an upstream branch with the same name.</p>
<p class="Pp">This mode is the default since Git 2.0, and is the safest option
    suited for beginners.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>matching</b> - push all branches having the
  same name on both ends. This makes the repository you are pushing to remember
  the set of branches that will be pushed out (e.g. if you always push
  <i>maint</i> and <i>master</i> there and no other branches, the repository you
  push to will have these two branches, and your local <i>maint</i> and
  <i>master</i> will be pushed there).
<p class="Pp">To use this mode effectively, you have to make sure <i>all</i> the
    branches you would push out are ready to be pushed out before running <i>git
    push</i>, as the whole point of this mode is to allow you to push all of the
    branches in one go. If you usually finish work on only one branch and push
    out the result, while other branches are unfinished, this mode is not for
    you. Also this mode is not suitable for pushing into a shared central
    repository, as other people may add new branches there, or update the tip of
    existing branches outside your control.</p>
<p class="Pp">This used to be the default, but not since Git 2.0 (<b>simple</b>
    is the new default).</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp">push.followTags</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If set to true, enable <b>--follow-tags</b> option by
  default. You may override this configuration at time of push by specifying
  <b>--no-follow-tags</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">push.gpgSign</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">May be set to a boolean value, or the string
  <i>if-asked</i>. A true value causes all pushes to be GPG signed, as if
  <b>--signed</b> is passed to <b>git-push</b>(1). The string <i>if-asked</i>
  causes pushes to be signed if the server supports it, as if
  <b>--signed=if-asked</b> is passed to <i>git push</i>. A false value may
  override a value from a lower-priority config file. An explicit command-line
  flag always overrides this config option.</div>
<p class="Pp">push.pushOption</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When no <b>--push-option=</b><i>&lt;option&gt;</i>
  argument is given from the command line, <b>git</b> <b>push</b> behaves as if
  each &lt;value&gt; of this variable is given as
  <b>--push-option=</b><i>&lt;value&gt;</i>.
<p class="Pp">This is a multi-valued variable, and an empty value can be used in
    a higher priority configuration file (e.g. .<b>git/config</b> in a
    repository) to clear the values inherited from a lower priority
    configuration files (e.g. <b>$HOME/.gitconfig</b>).</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>Example:
/etc/gitconfig
<br/>
  push.pushoption = a
<br/>
  push.pushoption = b
~/.gitconfig
<br/>
  push.pushoption = c
repo/.git/config
<br/>
  push.pushoption =
<br/>
  push.pushoption = b
This will result in only b (a and c are cleared).</pre>
</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp">push.recurseSubmodules</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">May be &quot;check&quot;, &quot;on-demand&quot;,
  &quot;only&quot;, or &quot;no&quot;, with the same behavior as that of
  &quot;push --recurse-submodules&quot;. If not set, <i>no</i> is used by
  default, unless <i>submodule.recurse</i> is set (in which case a <i>true</i>
  value means <i>on-demand</i>).</div>
<p class="Pp">push.useForceIfIncludes</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If set to &quot;true&quot;, it is equivalent to
  specifying <b>--force-if-includes</b> as an option to <b>git-push</b>(1) in
  the command line. Adding <b>--no-force-if-includes</b> at the time of push
  overrides this configuration setting.</div>
<p class="Pp">push.negotiate</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If set to &quot;true&quot;, attempt to reduce the size of
  the packfile sent by rounds of negotiation in which the client and the server
  attempt to find commits in common. If &quot;false&quot;, Git will rely solely
  on the server&#x2019;s ref advertisement to find commits in common.</div>
<p class="Pp">push.useBitmaps</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If set to &quot;false&quot;, disable use of bitmaps for
  &quot;git push&quot; even if <b>pack.useBitmaps</b> is &quot;true&quot;,
  without preventing other git operations from using bitmaps. Default is
  true.</div>
