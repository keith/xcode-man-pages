<i>Screen</i> is a full-screen window manager that multiplexes a physical
  terminal between several processes (typically interactive shells). Each
  virtual terminal provides the functions of a DEC VT100 terminal and, in
  addition, several control functions from the ISO 6429 (ECMA 48, ANSI X3.64)
  and ISO 2022 standards (e.g. insert/delete line and support for multiple
  character sets). There is a scrollback history buffer for each virtual
  terminal and a copy-and-paste mechanism that allows moving text regions
  between windows.
<p class="Pp">When <i>screen</i> is called, it creates a single window with a
    shell in it (or the specified command) and then gets out of your way so that
    you can use the program as you normally would. Then, at any time, you can
    create new (full-screen) windows with other programs in them (including more
    shells), kill existing windows, view a list of windows, turn output logging
    on and off, copy-and-paste text between windows, view the scrollback
    history, switch between windows in whatever manner you wish, etc. All
    windows run their programs completely independent of each other. Programs
    continue to run when their window is currently not visible and even when the
    whole <i>screen</i> session is detached from the user's terminal. When a
    program terminates, <i>screen</i> (per default) kills the window that
    contained it. If this window was in the foreground, the display switches to
    the previous window; if none are left, <i>screen</i> exits.</p>
<p class="Pp">Everything you type is sent to the program running in the current
    window. The only exception to this is the one keystroke that is used to
    initiate a command to the window manager. By default, each command begins
    with a control-a (abbreviated C-a from now on), and is followed by one other
    keystroke. The command character and all the key bindings can be fully
    customized to be anything you like, though they are always two characters in
    length.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Screen</i> does not understand the prefix &quot;C-&quot; to
    mean control. Please use the caret notation (&quot;^A&quot; instead of
    &quot;C-a&quot;) as arguments to e.g. the <i>escape</i> command or the
    <i>-e</i> option. <i>Screen</i> will also print out control characters in
    caret notation.</p>
<p class="Pp">The standard way to create a new window is to type &quot;C-a
    c&quot;. This creates a new window running a shell and switches to that
    window immediately, regardless of the state of the process running in the
    current window. Similarly, you can create a new window with a custom command
    in it by first binding the command to a keystroke (in your .screenrc file or
    at the &quot;C-a :&quot; command line) and then using it just like the
    &quot;C-a c&quot; command. In addition, new windows can be created by
    running a command like:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>screen emacs prog.c</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">from a shell prompt within a previously created window. This will
    not run another copy of <i>screen</i>, but will instead supply the command
    name and its arguments to the window manager (specified in the $STY
    environment variable) who will use it to create the new window. The above
    example would start the emacs editor (editing prog.c) and switch to its
    window.</p>
<p class="Pp">If &quot;/etc/utmp&quot; is writable by <i>screen</i>, an
    appropriate record will be written to this file for each window, and removed
    when the window is terminated. This is useful for working with
    &quot;talk&quot;, &quot;script&quot;, &quot;shutdown&quot;,
    &quot;rsend&quot;, &quot;sccs&quot; and other similar programs that use the
    utmp file to determine who you are. As long as <i>screen</i> is active on
    your terminal, the terminal's own record is removed from the utmp file. See
    also &quot;C-a L&quot;.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="GETTING_STARTED"><a class="permalink" href="#GETTING_STARTED">GETTING
  STARTED</a></h1>
Before you begin to use <i>screen</i> you'll need to make sure you have
  correctly selected your terminal type, just as you would for any other
  termcap/terminfo program. (You can do this by using <i>tset</i> for example.)
<p class="Pp">If you're impatient and want to get started without doing a lot
    more reading, you should remember this one command: &quot;C-a ?&quot;.
    Typing these two characters will display a list of the available
    <i>screen</i> commands and their bindings. Each keystroke is discussed in
    the section &quot;DEFAULT KEY BINDINGS&quot;. The manual section
    &quot;CUSTOMIZATION&quot; deals with the contents of your .screenrc.</p>
<p class="Pp">If your terminal is a &quot;true&quot; auto-margin terminal (it
    doesn't allow the last position on the screen to be updated without
    scrolling the screen) consider using a version of your terminal's termcap
    that has automatic margins turned <i>off</i>. This will ensure an accurate
    and optimal update of the screen in all circumstances. Most terminals
    nowadays have &quot;magic&quot; margins (automatic margins plus usable last
    column). This is the VT100 style type and perfectly suited for
    <i>screen</i>. If all you've got is a &quot;true&quot; auto-margin terminal
    <i>screen</i> will be content to use it, but updating a character put into
    the last position on the screen may not be possible until the screen scrolls
    or the character is moved into a safe position in some other way. This delay
    can be shortened by using a terminal with insert-character capability.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="COMMAND-LINE_OPTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#COMMAND-LINE_OPTIONS">COMMAND-LINE
  OPTIONS</a></h1>
Screen has the following command-line options:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>-a</b></dt>
  <dd>include <i>all</i> capabilities (with some minor exceptions) in each
      window's termcap, even if <i>screen</i> must redraw parts of the display
      in order to implement a function.</dd>
  <dt><b>-A</b></dt>
  <dd>Adapt the sizes of all windows to the size of the current terminal. By
      default, <i>screen</i> tries to restore its old window sizes when
      attaching to resizable terminals (those with &quot;WS&quot; in its
      description, e.g. suncmd or some xterm).</dd>
  <dt><b>-c </b><i>file</i></dt>
  <dd>override the default configuration file from &quot;$HOME/.screenrc&quot;
      to <i>file</i>.</dd>
  <dt><b>-d</b>|<b>-D</b> [<b><i>pid.tty.host</i></b><i>]</i></dt>
  <dd>does not start <i>screen</i>, but detaches the elsewhere running
      <i>screen</i> session. It has the same effect as typing &quot;C-a d&quot;
      from <i>screen</i>'s controlling terminal. <b>-D</b> is the equivalent to
      the power detach key. If no session can be detached, this option is
      ignored. In combination with the <b>-r</b>/<b>-R</b> option more powerful
      effects can be achieved:</dd>
  <dt><b>-d -r</b></dt>
  <dd>Reattach a session and if necessary detach it first.</dd>
  <dt><b>-d -R</b></dt>
  <dd>Reattach a session and if necessary detach or even create it first.</dd>
  <dt><b>-d -RR</b></dt>
  <dd>Reattach a session and if necessary detach or create it. Use the first
      session if more than one session is available.</dd>
  <dt><b>-D -r</b></dt>
  <dd>Reattach a session. If necessary detach and logout remotely first.</dd>
  <dt><b>-D -R</b></dt>
  <dd>Attach here and now. In detail this means: If a session is running, then
      reattach. If necessary detach and logout remotely first. If it was not
      running create it and notify the user. This is the author's favorite.</dd>
  <dt><b>-D -RR</b></dt>
  <dd>Attach here and now. Whatever that means, just do it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>
  </dt>
  <dd>Note: It is always a good idea to check the status of your sessions by
      means of &quot;screen -list&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>-e </b><i>xy</i></dt>
  <dd>specifies the command character to be <i>x</i> and the character
      generating a literal command character to <i>y</i> (when typed after the
      command character). The default is &quot;C-a&quot; and `a', which can be
      specified as &quot;-e^Aa&quot;. When creating a <i>screen</i> session,
      this option sets the default command character. In a multiuser session all
      users added will start off with this command character. But when attaching
      to an already running session, this option changes only the command
      character of the attaching user. This option is equivalent to either the
      commands &quot;defescape&quot; or &quot;escape&quot; respectively.</dd>
  <dt><b>-f<i></i></b><i>, </i><b><i>-fn</i></b><i>, and
    </i><b><i>-fa</i></b></dt>
  <dd>turns flow-control on, off, or &quot;automatic switching mode&quot;. This
      can also be defined through the &quot;defflow&quot; .screenrc
    command.</dd>
  <dt><b>-h </b><i>num</i></dt>
  <dd>Specifies the history scrollback buffer to be <i>num</i> lines high.</dd>
  <dt><b>-i</b></dt>
  <dd>will cause the interrupt key (usually C-c) to interrupt the display
      immediately when flow-control is on. See the &quot;defflow&quot; .screenrc
      command for details. The use of this option is discouraged.</dd>
  <dt><b>-l</b> and <b>-ln</b></dt>
  <dd>turns login mode on or off (for /etc/utmp updating). This can also be
      defined through the &quot;deflogin&quot; .screenrc command.</dd>
  <dt><b>-ls</b> and <b>-list</b></dt>
  <dd>does not start <i>screen</i>, but prints a list of <i>pid.tty.host</i>
      strings identifying your <i>screen</i> sessions. Sessions marked
      `detached' can be resumed with &quot;screen -r&quot;. Those marked
      `attached' are running and have a controlling terminal. If the session
      runs in multiuser mode, it is marked `multi'. Sessions marked as
      `unreachable' either live on a different host or are `dead'. An
      unreachable session is considered dead, when its name matches either the
      name of the local host, or the specified parameter, if any. See the
      <b>-r</b> flag for a description how to construct matches. Sessions marked
      as `dead' should be thoroughly checked and removed. Ask your system
      administrator if you are not sure. Remove sessions with the <b>-wipe</b>
      option.</dd>
  <dt><b>-L</b></dt>
  <dd>tells <i>screen</i> to turn on automatic output logging for the
    windows.</dd>
  <dt><b>-m</b></dt>
  <dd>causes <i>screen</i> to ignore the $STY environment variable. With
      &quot;screen -m&quot; creation of a new session is enforced, regardless
      whether <i>screen</i> is called from within another <i>screen</i> session
      or not. This flag has a special meaning in connection with the `-d'
      option:</dd>
  <dt><b>-d -m</b></dt>
  <dd>Start <i>screen</i> in &quot;detached&quot; mode. This creates a new
      session but doesn't attach to it. This is useful for system startup
      scripts.</dd>
  <dt><b>-D -m</b></dt>
  <dd>This also starts screen in &quot;detached&quot; mode, but doesn't fork a
      new process. The command exits if the session terminates.</dd>
  <dt><b>-O</b></dt>
  <dd>selects a more optimal output mode for your terminal rather than true
      VT100 emulation (only affects auto-margin terminals without `LP'). This
      can also be set in your .screenrc by specifying `OP' in a
      &quot;termcap&quot; command.</dd>
  <dt><b>-p </b><i>number_or_name</i></dt>
  <dd>Preselect a window. This is usefull when you want to reattach to a
      specific windor or you want to send a command via the &quot;-X&quot;
      option to a specific window. As with screen's select commant,
      &quot;-&quot; selects the blank window. As a special case for reattach,
      &quot;=&quot; brings up the windowlist on the blank window.</dd>
  <dt><b>-q</b></dt>
  <dd>Suppress printing of error messages. In combination with &quot;-ls&quot;
      the exit value is as follows: 9 indicates a directory without sessions. 10
      indicates a directory with running but not attachable sessions. 11 (or
      more) indicates 1 (or more) usable sessions. In combination with
      &quot;-r&quot; the exit value is as follows: 10 indicates that there is no
      session to resume. 12 (or more) indicates that there are 2 (or more)
      sessions to resume and you should specify which one to choose. In all
      other cases &quot;-q&quot; has no effect.</dd>
  <dt><b>-r</b> [<b><i>pid.tty.host</i></b><i>]</i></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>-r</b>
    <i>sessionowner/[</i><b><i></i><i>pid.tty.host</i></b><i>]</i></dt>
  <dd>resumes a detached <i>screen</i> session. No other options (except
      combinations with <b>-d</b>/<b>-D</b>) may be specified, though an
      optional prefix of [<i>pid.</i>]<i>tty.host</i> may be needed to
      distinguish between multiple detached <i>screen</i> sessions. The second
      form is used to connect to another user's screen session which runs in
      multiuser mode. This indicates that screen should look for sessions in
      another user's directory. This requires setuid-root.</dd>
  <dt><b>-R</b></dt>
  <dd>attempts to resume the first detached <i>screen</i> session it finds. If
      successful, all other command-line options are ignored. If no detached
      session exists, starts a new session using the specified options, just as
      if <b>-R</b> had not been specified. The option is set by default if
      <i>screen</i> is run as a login-shell (actually screen uses
      &quot;-xRR&quot; in that case). For combinations with the
      <b>-d</b>/<b>-D</b> option see there.</dd>
  <dt><b>-s</b></dt>
  <dd>sets the default shell to the program specified, instead of the value in
      the environment variable $SHELL (or &quot;/bin/sh&quot; if not defined).
      This can also be defined through the &quot;shell&quot; .screenrc
    command.</dd>
  <dt><b>-S </b><i>sessionname</i></dt>
  <dd>When creating a new session, this option can be used to specify a
      meaningful name for the session. This name identifies the session for
      &quot;screen -list&quot; and &quot;screen -r&quot; actions. It substitutes
      the default [<i>tty.host</i>] suffix.</dd>
  <dt><b>-t </b><i>name</i></dt>
  <dd>sets the title (a.k.a.) for the default shell or specified program. See
      also the &quot;shelltitle&quot; .screenrc command.</dd>
  <dt><b>-U</b></dt>
  <dd>Run screen in UTF-8 mode. This option tells screen that your terminal
      sends and understands UTF-8 encoded characters. It also sets the default
      encoding for new windows to `utf8'.</dd>
  <dt><b>-v</b></dt>
  <dd>Print version number.</dd>
  <dt><b>-wipe</b> [<b><i>match</i></b><i>]</i></dt>
  <dd>does the same as &quot;screen -ls&quot;, but removes destroyed sessions
      instead of marking them as `dead'. An unreachable session is considered
      dead, when its name matches either the name of the local host, or the
      explicitly given parameter, if any. See the <b>-r</b> flag for a
      description how to construct matches.</dd>
  <dt><b>-x</b></dt>
  <dd>Attach to a not detached <i>screen</i> session. (Multi display mode).</dd>
  <dt><b>-X</b></dt>
  <dd>Send the specified command to a running screen session. You can use the
      <b>-d</b> or <b>-r</b> option to tell screen to look only for attached or
      detached screen sessions. Note that this command doesn't work if the
      session is password protected.

As mentioned, each <i>screen</i> command consists of a &quot;C-a&quot; followed
  by one other character. For your convenience, all commands that are bound to
  lower-case letters are also bound to their control character counterparts
  (with the exception of &quot;C-a a&quot;; see below), thus, &quot;C-a c&quot;
  as well as &quot;C-a C-c&quot; can be used to create a window. See section
  &quot;CUSTOMIZATION&quot; for a description of the command.

The &quot;socket directory&quot; defaults either to $HOME/.screen or simply to
  /tmp/screens or preferably to /usr/local/screens chosen at compile-time. If
  <i>screen</i> is installed setuid-root, then the administrator should compile
  <i>screen</i> with an adequate (not NFS mounted) socket directory. If
  <i>screen</i> is not running setuid-root, the user can specify any mode 700
  directory in the environment variable $SCREENDIR.
<p class="Pp">When <i>screen</i> is invoked, it executes initialization commands
    from the files &quot;/usr/local/etc/screenrc&quot; and &quot;.screenrc&quot;
    in the user's home directory. These are the &quot;programmer's
    defaults&quot; that can be overridden in the following ways: for the global
    screenrc file <i>screen</i> searches for the environment variable
    $SYSSCREENRC (this override feature may be disabled at compile-time). The
    user specific screenrc file is searched in $SCREENRC, then $HOME/.screenrc.
    The command line option <b>-c</b> takes precedence over the above user
    screenrc files.</p>
<p class="Pp">Commands in these files are used to set options, bind functions to
    keys, and to automatically establish one or more windows at the beginning of
    your <i>screen</i> session. Commands are listed one per line, with empty
    lines being ignored. A command's arguments are separated by tabs or spaces,
    and may be surrounded by single or double quotes. A `#' turns the rest of
    the line into a comment, except in quotes. Unintelligible lines are warned
    about and ignored. Commands may contain references to environment variables.
    The syntax is the shell-like &quot;$VAR &quot; or &quot;${VAR}&quot;. Note
    that this causes incompatibility with previous <i>screen</i> versions, as
    now the '$'-character has to be protected with '\' if no variable
    substitution shall be performed. A string in single-quotes is also protected
    from variable substitution.</p>
<p class="Pp">Two configuration files are shipped as examples with your screen
    distribution: &quot;etc/screenrc&quot; and &quot;etc/etcscreenrc&quot;. They
    contain a number of useful examples for various commands.</p>
<p class="Pp">Customization can also be done 'on-line'. To enter the command
    mode type `C-a :'. Note that commands starting with &quot;def&quot; change
    default values, while others change current settings.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following commands are available:</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>acladd</b><i> usernames</i> [<i>crypted-pw</i>]
  <br/>
  <b>addacl</b><i> usernames</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Enable users to fully access this screen session. <i>Usernames</i>
    can be one user or a comma separated list of users. This command enables to
    attach to the <i>screen</i> session and performs the equivalent of `aclchg
    <i>usernames</i> +rwx &quot;#?&quot;'. executed. To add a user with
    restricted access, use the `aclchg' command below. If an optional second
    parameter is supplied, it should be a crypted password for the named
    user(s). `Addacl' is a synonym to `acladd'. Multi user mode only.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>aclchg</b><i> usernames permbits list</i>
  <br/>
  <b>chacl</b><i> usernames permbits list</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Change permissions for a comma separated list of users. Permission
    bits are represented as `r', `w' and `x'. Prefixing `+' grants the
    permission, `-' removes it. The third parameter is a comma separated list of
    commands and/or windows (specified either by number or title). The special
    list `#' refers to all windows, `?' to all commands. if <i>usernames</i>
    consists of a single `*', all known users are affected. A command can be
    executed when the user has the `x' bit for it. The user can type input to a
    window when he has its `w' bit set and no other user obtains a writelock for
    this window. Other bits are currently ignored. To withdraw the writelock
    from another user in window 2: `aclchg <i>username</i> -w+w 2'. To allow
    read-only access to the session: `aclchg <i>username</i> -w &quot;#&quot;'.
    As soon as a user's name is known to <i>screen</i> he can attach to the
    session and (per default) has full permissions for all command and windows.
    Execution permission for the acl commands, `at' and others should also be
    removed or the user may be able to regain write permission. Rights of the
    special username <b>nobody</b> cannot be changed (see the &quot;su&quot;
    command). `Chacl' is a synonym to `aclchg'. Multi user mode only.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>acldel</b><i> username</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Remove a user from <i>screen</i>'s access control list. If
    currently attached, all the user's displays are detached from the session.
    He cannot attach again. Multi user mode only.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>aclgrp</b><i> username</i> [<i>groupname</i>]</p>
<p class="Pp">Creates groups of users that share common access rights. The name
    of the group is the username of the group leader. Each member of the group
    inherits the permissions that are granted to the group leader. That means,
    if a user fails an access check, another check is made for the group leader.
    A user is removed from all groups the special value &quot;none&quot; is used
    for <i>groupname</i>. If the second parameter is omitted all groups the user
    is in are listed.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>aclumask</b> [[<i>users</i>]<i>+bits</i>
    |[<i>users</i>]<i>-bits</i> .... ]
  <br/>
  <b>umask</b> [[<i>users</i>]<i>+bits</i> |[<i>users</i>]<i>-bits</i> ....
  ]</p>
<p class="Pp">This specifies the access other users have to windows that will be
    created by the caller of the command. <i>Users</i> may be no, one or a comma
    separated list of known usernames. If no users are specified, a list of all
    currently known users is assumed. <i>Bits</i> is any combination of access
    control bits allowed defined with the &quot;aclchg&quot; command. The
    special username &quot;?&quot; predefines the access that not yet known
    users will be granted to any window initially. The special username
    &quot;??&quot; predefines the access that not yet known users are granted to
    any command. Rights of the special username <b>nobody</b> cannot be changed
    (see the &quot;su&quot; command). `Umask' is a synonym to `aclumask'.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>activity</b><i> message</i></p>
<p class="Pp">When any activity occurs in a background window that is being
    monitored, <i>screen</i> displays a notification in the message line. The
    notification message can be re-defined by means of the &quot;activity&quot;
    command. Each occurrence of `%' in <i>message</i> is replaced by the number
    of the window in which activity has occurred, and each occurrence of `^G' is
    replaced by the definition for bell in your termcap (usually an audible
    bell). The default message is</p>
<p class="Pp">	'Activity in window %n'</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that monitoring is off for all windows by default, but can be
    altered by use of the &quot;monitor&quot; command (C-a M).</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>allpartial on</b>|<b>off</b></p>
<p class="Pp">If set to on, only the current cursor line is refreshed on window
    change. This affects all windows and is useful for slow terminal lines. The
    previous setting of full/partial refresh for each window is restored with
    &quot;allpartial off&quot;. This is a global flag that immediately takes
    effect on all windows overriding the &quot;partial&quot; settings. It does
    not change the default redraw behavior of newly created windows.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>altscreen on</b>|<b>off</b></p>
<p class="Pp">If set to on, &quot;alternate screen&quot; support is enabled in
    virtual terminals, just like in xterm. Initial setting is `off'.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>at </b>[<i>identifier</i>][<b>#<i>|</i>*<i>|</i>%<i>] </i></b>
    <i>command </i>[<i>args</i> ... ]</p>
<p class="Pp">Execute a command at other displays or windows as if it had been
    entered there. &quot;At&quot; changes the context (the `current window' or
    `current display' setting) of the command. If the first parameter describes
    a non-unique context, the command will be executed multiple times. If the
    first parameter is of the form `<i>identifier</i>*' then identifier is
    matched against user names. The command is executed once for each display of
    the selected user(s). If the first parameter is of the form
    `<i>identifier</i>%' identifier is matched against displays. Displays are
    named after the ttys they attach. The prefix `/dev/' or `/dev/tty' may be
    omitted from the identifier. If <i>identifier</i> has a `#' or nothing
    appended it is matched against window numbers and titles. Omitting an
    identifier in front of the `#', `*' or `%'-character selects all users,
    displays or windows because a prefix-match is performed. Note that on the
    affected display(s) a short message will describe what happened. Permission
    is checked for initiator of the &quot;at&quot; command, not for the owners
    of the affected display(s). Note that the '#' character works as a comment
    introducer when it is preceded by whitespace. This can be escaped by
    prefixing a '\'. Permission is checked for the initiator of the
    &quot;at&quot; command, not for the owners of the affected display(s).
  <br/>
  Caveat: When matching against windows, the command is executed at least once
    per window. Commands that change the internal arrangement of windows (like
    &quot;other&quot;) may be called again. In shared windows the command will
    be repeated for each attached display. Beware, when issuing toggle commands
    like &quot;login&quot;! Some commands (e.g. &quot;process&quot;) require
    that a display is associated with the target windows. These commands may not
    work correctly under &quot;at&quot; looping over windows.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>attrcolor </b><i>attrib</i>
  [<i>attribute/color-modifier</i>]</p>
<p class="Pp">This command can be used to highlight attributes by changing the
    color of the text. If the attribute <i>attrib</i> is in use, the specified
    attribute/color modifier is also applied. If no modifier is given, the
    current one is deleted. See the &quot;STRING ESCAPES&quot; chapter for the
    syntax of the modifier. Screen understands two pseudo-attributes,
    &quot;i&quot; stands for high-intensity foreground color and &quot;I&quot;
    for high-intensity background color.</p>
<p class="Pp">Examples:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>attrcolor b &quot;R&quot;</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Change the color to bright red if bold text is to be printed.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>attrcolor u &quot;-u b&quot;</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Use blue text instead of underline.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>attrcolor b &quot;.I&quot;</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Use bright colors for bold text. Most terminal emulators do this
    already.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>attrcolor i &quot;+b&quot;</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Make bright colored text also bold.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>autodetach on</b>|<b>off</b></p>
<p class="Pp">Sets whether <i>screen</i> will automatically detach upon hangup,
    which saves all your running programs until they are resumed with a
    <b>screen -r</b> command. When turned off, a hangup signal will terminate
    <i>screen</i> and all the processes it contains. Autodetach is on by
    default.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>autonuke on</b>|<b>off</b></p>
<p class="Pp">Sets whether a clear screen sequence should nuke all the output
    that has not been written to the terminal. See also
  &quot;obuflimit&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>backtick </b><i>id</i> <i>lifespan</i> <i>autorefresh</i>
    <i>cmd</i> <i>args...</i>
  <br/>
  <b>backtick </b><i>id</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Program the backtick command with the numerical id <i>id</i>. The
    output of such a command is used for substitution of the &quot;%`&quot;
    string escape. The specified <i>lifespan</i> is the number of seconds the
    output is considered valid. After this time, the command is run again if a
    corresponding string escape is encountered. The <i>autorefresh</i> parameter
    triggers an automatic refresh for caption and hardstatus strings after the
    specified number of seconds. Only the last line of output is used for
    substitution.
  <br/>
  If both the <i>lifespan</i> and the <i>autorefresh</i> parameters are zero,
    the backtick program is expected to stay in the background and generate
    output once in a while. In this case, the command is executed right away and
    screen stores the last line of output. If a new line gets printed screen
    will automatically refresh the hardstatus or the captions.
  <br/>
  The second form of the command deletes the backtick command with the numerical
    id <i>id</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>bce </b>[<b>on</b>|<b>off</b>]</p>
<p class="Pp">Change background-color-erase setting. If &quot;bce&quot; is set
    to on, all characters cleared by an erase/insert/scroll/clear operation will
    be displayed in the current background color. Otherwise the default
    background color is used.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>bell_msg</b> [<i>message</i>]</p>
<p class="Pp">When a bell character is sent to a background window,
    <i>screen</i> displays a notification in the message line. The notification
    message can be re-defined by this command. Each occurrence of `%' in
    <i>message</i> is replaced by the number of the window to which a bell has
    been sent, and each occurrence of `^G' is replaced by the definition for
    bell in your termcap (usually an audible bell). The default message is</p>
<p class="Pp">	'Bell in window %n'</p>
<p class="Pp">An empty message can be supplied to the &quot;bell_msg&quot;
    command to suppress output of a message line (bell_msg &quot;&quot;).
    Without parameter, the current message is shown.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>bind </b> [<b>-c</b> <i>class</i>] <i>key</i> [<i>command</i>
    [<i>args</i>]]</p>
<p class="Pp">Bind a command to a key. By default, most of the commands provided
    by <i>screen</i> are bound to one or more keys as indicated in the
    &quot;DEFAULT KEY BINDINGS&quot; section, e.g. the command to create a new
    window is bound to &quot;C-c&quot; and &quot;c&quot;. The &quot;bind&quot;
    command can be used to redefine the key bindings and to define new bindings.
    The <i>key</i> argument is either a single character, a two-character
    sequence of the form &quot;^x&quot; (meaning &quot;C-x&quot;), a backslash
    followed by an octal number (specifying the ASCII code of the character), or
    a backslash followed by a second character, such as &quot;\^&quot; or
    &quot;\\&quot;. The argument can also be quoted, if you like. If no further
    argument is given, any previously established binding for this key is
    removed. The <i>command</i> argument can be any command listed in this
    section.</p>
<p class="Pp">If a command class is specified via the &quot;-c&quot; option, the
    key is bound for the specified class. Use the &quot;command&quot; command to
    activate a class. Command classes can be used to create multiple command
    keys or multi-character bindings.</p>
<p class="Pp">Some examples:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
	bind ' ' windows
	bind ^k
	bind k
	bind K kill
	bind ^f screen telnet foobar
	bind \033 screen -ln -t root -h 1000 9 su
</pre>
<p class="Pp">would bind the space key to the command that displays a list of
    windows (so that the command usually invoked by &quot;C-a C-w&quot; would
    also be available as &quot;C-a space&quot;). The next three lines remove the
    default kill binding from &quot;C-a C-k&quot; and &quot;C-a k&quot;.
    &quot;C-a K&quot; is then bound to the kill command. Then it binds
    &quot;C-f&quot; to the command &quot;create a window with a TELNET
    connection to foobar&quot;, and bind &quot;escape&quot; to the command that
    creates an non-login window with a.k.a. &quot;root&quot; in slot #9, with a
    superuser shell and a scrollback buffer of 1000 lines.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
	bind -c demo1 0 select 10
	bind -c demo1 1 select 11
	bind -c demo1 2 select 12
	bindkey &quot;^B&quot; command -c demo1
</pre>
<p class="Pp">makes &quot;C-b 0&quot; select window 10, &quot;C-b 1&quot; window
    11, etc.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
	bind -c demo2 0 select 10
	bind -c demo2 1 select 11
	bind -c demo2 2 select 12
	bind - command -c demo2
</pre>
<p class="Pp">makes &quot;C-a - 0&quot; select window 10, &quot;C-a - 1&quot;
    window 11, etc.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>bindkey</b> [<b>-d</b>] [<b>-m</b>] [<b>-a</b>]
    [[<b>-k</b>|<b>-t</b>] <i>string</i> [<i>cmd args</i>]]</p>
<p class="Pp">This command manages screen's input translation tables. Every
    entry in one of the tables tells screen how to react if a certain sequence
    of characters is encountered. There are three tables: one that should
    contain actions programmed by the user, one for the default actions used for
    terminal emulation and one for screen's copy mode to do cursor movement. See
    section &quot;INPUT TRANSLATION&quot; for a list of default key bindings.
  <br/>
  If the <b>-d</b> option is given, bindkey modifies the default table,
    <b>-m</b> changes the copy mode table and with neither option the user table
    is selected. The argument <i>string</i> is the sequence of characters to
    which an action is bound. This can either be a fixed string or a termcap
    keyboard capability name (selectable with the <b>-k</b> option).
  <br/>
  Some keys on a VT100 terminal can send a different string if application mode
    is turned on (e.g the cursor keys). Such keys have two entries in the
    translation table. You can select the application mode entry by specifying
    the <b>-a</b> option.
  <br/>
  The <b>-t</b> option tells screen not to do inter-character timing. One cannot
    turn off the timing if a termcap capability is used.
  <br/>
  <i>Cmd</i> can be any of screen's commands with an arbitrary number of
    <i>args</i>. If <i>cmd</i> is omitted the key-binding is removed from the
    table.
  <br/>
  Here are some examples of keyboard bindings:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
        bindkey -d
</pre>
Show all of the default key bindings. The application mode entries are marked
  with [A].
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
        bindkey -k k1 select 1
</pre>
Make the &quot;F1&quot; key switch to window one.
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
        bindkey -t foo stuff barfoo
</pre>
Make &quot;foo&quot; an abbreviation of the word &quot;barfoo&quot;. Timeout is
  disabled so that users can type slowly.
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
        bindkey &quot;\024&quot; mapdefault
</pre>
This key-binding makes &quot;^T&quot; an escape character for key-bindings. If
  you did the above &quot;stuff barfoo&quot; binding, you can enter the word
  &quot;foo&quot; by typing &quot;^Tfoo&quot;. If you want to insert a
  &quot;^T&quot; you have to press the key twice (i.e. escape the escape
  binding).
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
        bindkey -k F1 command
</pre>
Make the F11 (not F1!) key an alternative screen escape (besides ^A).
<p class="Pp"><b>break</b> [<i>duration</i>]</p>
<p class="Pp">Send a break signal for <i>duration</i>*0.25 seconds to this
    window. For non-Posix systems the time interval may be rounded up to full
    seconds. Most useful if a character device is attached to the window rather
    than a shell process (See also chapter &quot;WINDOW TYPES&quot;). The
    maximum duration of a break signal is limited to 15 seconds.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>blanker</b></p>
<p class="Pp">Activate the screen blanker. First the screen is cleared. If no
    blanker program is defined, the cursor is turned off, otherwise, the program
    is started and it's output is written to the screen. The screen blanker is
    killed with the first keypress, the read key is discarded.
  <br/>
  This command is normally used together with the &quot;idle&quot; command.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>blankerprg</b> [<i>program args</i>]</p>
<p class="Pp">Defines a blanker program. Disables the blanker program if no
    arguments are given.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>breaktype</b> [<i>tcsendbreak</i>|<i>TIOCSBRK</i>
    |<i>TCSBRK</i>]</p>
<p class="Pp">Choose one of the available methods of generating a break signal
    for terminal devices. This command should affect the current window only.
    But it still behaves identical to &quot;defbreaktype&quot;. This will be
    changed in the future. Calling &quot;breaktype&quot; with no parameter
    displays the break method for the current window.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>bufferfile</b> [<i>exchange-file</i>]</p>
<p class="Pp">Change the filename used for reading and writing with the paste
    buffer. If the optional argument to the &quot;bufferfile&quot; command is
    omitted, the default setting (&quot;/tmp/screen-exchange&quot;) is
    reactivated. The following example will paste the system's password file
    into the <i>screen</i> window (using the paste buffer, where a copy
    remains):</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
	C-a : bufferfile /etc/passwd
	C-a &lt; C-a ]
	C-a : bufferfile
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><b>c1 </b>[<b>on</b>|<b>off</b>]</p>
<p class="Pp">Change c1 code processing. &quot;C1 on&quot; tells screen to treat
    the input characters between 128 and 159 as control functions. Such an 8-bit
    code is normally the same as ESC followed by the corresponding 7-bit code.
    The default setting is to process c1 codes and can be changed with the
    &quot;defc1&quot; command. Users with fonts that have usable characters in
    the c1 positions may want to turn this off.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>caption always</b>|<b>splitonly</b> [<i>string</i>]
  <br/>
  <b>caption string</b> [<i>string</i>]</p>
<p class="Pp">This command controls the display of the window captions. Normally
    a caption is only used if more than one window is shown on the display
    (split screen mode). But if the type is set to <b>always</b> screen shows a
    caption even if only one window is displayed. The default is
    <b>splitonly</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The second form changes the text used for the caption. You can use
    all escapes from the &quot;STRING ESCAPES&quot; chapter. Screen uses a
    default of `%3n %t'.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can mix both forms by providing a string as an additional
    argument.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>charset </b><i>set</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Change the current character set slot designation and charset
    mapping. The first four character of <i>set</i> are treated as charset
    designators while the fifth and sixth character must be in range '0' to '3'
    and set the GL/GR charset mapping. On every position a '.' may be used to
    indicate that the corresponding charset/mapping should not be changed
    (<i>set</i> is padded to six characters internally by appending '.' chars).
    New windows have &quot;BBBB02&quot; as default charset, unless a
    &quot;encoding&quot; command is active.
  <br/>
  The current setting can be viewed with the &quot;info&quot; command.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>chdir</b> [<i>directory</i>]</p>
<p class="Pp">Change the <i>current directory</i> of <i>screen</i> to the
    specified directory or, if called without an argument, to your home
    directory (the value of the environment variable $HOME). All windows that
    are created by means of the &quot;screen&quot; command from within
    &quot;.screenrc&quot; or by means of &quot;C-a : screen ...&quot; or
    &quot;C-a c&quot; use this as their default directory. Without a chdir
    command, this would be the directory from which <i>screen</i> was invoked.
    Hardcopy and log files are always written to the <i>window's</i> default
    directory, <i>not</i> the current directory of the process running in the
    window. You can use this command multiple times in your .screenrc to start
    various windows in different default directories, but the last chdir value
    will affect all the windows you create interactively.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>clear</b></p>
<p class="Pp">Clears the current window and saves its image to the scrollback
    buffer.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>colon</b> [<i>prefix</i>]</p>
<p class="Pp">Allows you to enter &quot;.screenrc&quot; command lines. Useful
    for on-the-fly modification of key bindings, specific window creation and
    changing settings. Note that the &quot;set&quot; keyword no longer exists!
    Usually commands affect the current window rather than default settings for
    future windows. Change defaults with commands starting with 'def...'.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you consider this as the `Ex command mode' of <i>screen</i>,
    you may regard &quot;C-a esc&quot; (copy mode) as its `Vi command mode'.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>command</b> [<b>-c</b> <i>class</i>]</p>
<p class="Pp">This command has the same effect as typing the screen escape
    character (^A). It is probably only useful for key bindings. If the
    &quot;-c&quot; option is given, select the specified command class. See also
    &quot;bind&quot; and &quot;bindkey&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>compacthist </b>[<b>on</b>|<b>off</b>]</p>
<p class="Pp">This tells screen whether to suppress trailing blank lines when
    scrolling up text into the history buffer.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>console </b>[<b>on</b>|<b>off</b>]</p>
<p class="Pp">Grabs or un-grabs the machines console output to a window.
    <i>Note</i>: Only the owner of /dev/console can grab the console output.
    This command is only available if the machine supports the ioctl
  TIOCCONS.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>copy</b></p>
<p class="Pp">Enter copy/scrollback mode. This allows you to copy text from the
    current window and its history into the paste buffer. In this mode a vi-like
    `full screen editor' is active:
  <br/>
  <i>Movement keys</i>:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <b>h</b>, <b>j</b>, <b>k</b>, <b>l</b> move the cursor line by line or column
    by column.
  <br/>
  <b>0</b>, <b>^</b> and <b>$</b> move to the leftmost column, to the first or
    last non-whitespace character on the line.
  <br/>
  <b>H</b>, <b>M</b> and <b>L</b> move the cursor to the leftmost column of the
    top, center or bottom line of the window.
  <br/>
  <b>+</b> and <b>-</b> positions one line up and down.
  <br/>
  <b>G</b> moves to the specified absolute line (default: end of buffer).
  <br/>
  <b>|</b> moves to the specified absolute column.
  <br/>
  <b>w</b>, <b>b</b>, <b>e</b> move the cursor word by word.
  <br/>
  <b>B</b>, <b>E</b> move the cursor WORD by WORD (as in vi).
  <br/>
  <b>C-u</b> and <b>C-d</b> scroll the display up/down by the specified amount
    of lines while preserving the cursor position. (Default: half screen-full).
  <br/>
  <b>C-b</b> and <b>C-f</b> scroll the display up/down a full screen.
  <br/>
  <b>g</b> moves to the beginning of the buffer.
  <br/>
  <b>%</b> jumps to the specified percentage of the buffer.
  <br/>
</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Note</i>:
  <br/>
  Emacs style movement keys can be customized by a .screenrc command. (E.g.
    markkeys &quot;h=^B:l=^F:$=^E&quot;) There is no simple method for a full
    emacs-style keymap, as this involves multi-character codes.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Marking</i>:
  <br/>
  The copy range is specified by setting two marks. The text between these marks
    will be highlighted. Press
  <br/>
  <b>space</b> to set the first or second mark respectively.
  <br/>
  <b>Y</b> and <b>y</b> used to mark one whole line or to mark from start of
    line.
  <br/>
  <b>W</b> marks exactly one word.
  <br/>
  <i>Repeat count</i>:
  <br/>
  Any of these commands can be prefixed with a repeat count number by pressing
    digits
  <br/>
  <b>0</b>..<b>9</b> which is taken as a repeat count.
  <br/>
  Example: &quot;C-a C-[ H 10 j 5 Y&quot; will copy lines 11 to 15 into the
    paste buffer.
  <br/>
  <i>Searching</i>: <b>/</b> <i>Vi</i>-like search forward. <b>?</b>
    <i>Vi</i>-like search backward. <b>C-a s</b> <i>Emacs</i> style incremental
    search forward. <b>C-r</b> <i>Emacs</i> style reverse i-search.
    <i>Specials</i>:
  <br/>
  There are however some keys that act differently than in <i>vi</i>. <i>Vi</i>
    does not allow one to yank rectangular blocks of text, but <i>screen</i>
    does. Press
  <br/>
  <b>c</b> or <b>C</b> to set the left or right margin respectively. If no
    repeat count is given, both default to the current cursor position.
  <br/>
  Example: Try this on a rather full text screen: &quot;C-a [ M 20 l SPACE c 10
    l 5 j C SPACE&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">This moves one to the middle line of the screen, moves in 20
    columns left, marks the beginning of the paste buffer, sets the left column,
    moves 5 columns down, sets the right column, and then marks the end of the
    paste buffer. Now try:
  <br/>
  &quot;C-a [ M 20 l SPACE 10 l 5 j SPACE&quot;</p>
<p class="Pp">and notice the difference in the amount of text copied.
  <br/>
  <b>J</b> joins lines. It toggles between 4 modes: lines separated by a newline
    character (012), lines glued seamless, lines separated by a single
    whitespace and comma separated lines. Note that you can prepend the newline
    character with a carriage return character, by issuing a &quot;crlf
    on&quot;.
  <br/>
  <b>v</b> is for all the <i>vi</i> users with &quot;:set numbers&quot; - it
    toggles the left margin between column 9 and 1. Press
  <br/>
  <b>a</b> before the final space key to toggle in append mode. Thus the
    contents of the paste buffer will not be overwritten, but is appended to.
  <br/>
  <b>A</b> toggles in append mode and sets a (second) mark.
  <br/>
  <b>&gt;</b> sets the (second) mark and writes the contents of the paste buffer
    to the screen-exchange file (/tmp/screen-exchange per default) once
    copy-mode is finished.
  <br/>
  This example demonstrates how to dump the whole scrollback buffer to that
    file: &quot;C-A [ g SPACE G $ &gt;&quot;.
  <br/>
  <b>C-g</b> gives information about the current line and column.
  <br/>
  <b>x</b> exchanges the first mark and the current cursor position. You can use
    this to adjust an already placed mark.
  <br/>
  <b>@</b> does nothing. Does not even exit copy mode.
  <br/>
  All keys not described here exit copy mode.
  <br/>
</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>copy_reg</b> [<i>key</i>]</p>
<p class="Pp">No longer exists, use &quot;readreg&quot; instead.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>crlf </b>[<b>on</b>|<b>off</b>]</p>
<p class="Pp">This affects the copying of text regions with the `C-a [' command.
    If it is set to `on', lines will be separated by the two character sequence
    `CR' - `LF'. Otherwise (default) only `LF' is used. When no parameter is
    given, the state is toggled.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>debug on</b>|<b>off</b></p>
<p class="Pp">Turns runtime debugging on or off. If <i>screen</i> has been
    compiled with option -DDEBUG debugging available and is turned on per
    default. Note that this command only affects debugging output from the main
    &quot;SCREEN&quot; process correctly. Debug output from attacher processes
    can only be turned off once and forever.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>defc1 on</b>|<b>off</b></p>
<p class="Pp">Same as the <b>c1</b> command except that the default setting for
    new windows is changed. Initial setting is `on'.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>defautonuke on</b>|<b>off</b></p>
<p class="Pp">Same as the <b>autonuke</b> command except that the default
    setting for new displays is changed. Initial setting is `off'. Note that you
    can use the special `AN' terminal capability if you want to have a
    dependency on the terminal type.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>defbce on</b>|<b>off</b></p>
<p class="Pp">Same as the <b>bce</b> command except that the default setting for
    new windows is changed. Initial setting is `off'.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>defbreaktype</b> [<i>tcsendbreak</i>|<i>TIOCSBRK</i>
    |<i>TCSBRK</i>]</p>
<p class="Pp">Choose one of the available methods of generating a break signal
    for terminal devices. The preferred methods are <i>tcsendbreak</i> and
    <i>TIOCSBRK</i>. The third, <i>TCSBRK</i>, blocks the complete <i>screen</i>
    session for the duration of the break, but it may be the only way to
    generate long breaks. <i>Tcsendbreak</i> and <i>TIOCSBRK</i> may or may not
    produce long breaks with spikes (e.g. 4 per second). This is not only system
    dependant, this also differs between serial board drivers. Calling
    &quot;defbreaktype&quot; with no parameter displays the current setting.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>defcharset </b>[<b><i>set</i></b><i>]</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Like the <b>charset</b> command except that the default setting
    for new windows is changed. Shows current default if called without
    argument.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>defescape </b><i>xy</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Set the default command characters. This is equivalent to the
    &quot;escape&quot; except that it is useful multiuser sessions only. In a
    multiuser session &quot;escape&quot; changes the command character of the
    calling user, where &quot;defescape&quot; changes the default command
    characters for users that will be added later.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>defflow on</b>|<b>off</b>|<b>auto</b> [<b>interrupt</b>]</p>
<p class="Pp">Same as the <b>flow</b> command except that the default setting
    for new windows is changed. Initial setting is `auto'. Specifying
    &quot;defflow auto interrupt&quot; is the same as the command-line options
    <b>-fa</b> and <b>-i</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>defgr on</b>|<b>off</b></p>
<p class="Pp">Same as the <b>gr</b> command except that the default setting for
    new windows is changed. Initial setting is `off'.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>defhstatus </b>[<b><i>status</i></b><i>]</i></p>
<p class="Pp">The hardstatus line that all new windows will get is set to
    <i>status.</i> This command is useful to make the hardstatus of every window
    display the window number or title or the like. <i>Status</i> may contain
    the same directives as in the window messages, but the directive escape
    character is '^E' (octal 005) instead of '%'. This was done to make a
    misinterpretation of program generated hardstatus lines impossible. If the
    parameter <i>status</i> is omitted, the current default string is displayed.
    Per default the hardstatus line of new windows is empty.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>defencoding </b><i>enc</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Same as the <b>encoding</b> command except that the default
    setting for new windows is changed. Initial setting is the encoding taken
    from the terminal.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>deflog on</b>|<b>off</b></p>
<p class="Pp">Same as the <b>log</b> command except that the default setting for
    new windows is changed. Initial setting is `off'.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>deflogin on</b>|<b>off</b></p>
<p class="Pp">Same as the <b>login</b> command except that the default setting
    for new windows is changed. This is initialized with `on' as distributed
    (see config.h.in).</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>defmode </b><i>mode</i></p>
<p class="Pp">The mode of each newly allocated pseudo-tty is set to <i>mode</i>.
    <i>Mode</i> is an octal number. When no &quot;defmode&quot; command is
    given, mode 0622 is used.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>defmonitor on</b>|<b>off</b></p>
<p class="Pp">Same as the <b>monitor</b> command except that the default setting
    for new windows is changed. Initial setting is `off'.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>defnonblock</b> <b>on</b>|<b>off</b>|<b><i>numsecs</i></b></p>
<p class="Pp">Same as the <b>nonblock</b> command except that the default
    setting for displays is changed. Initial setting is `off'.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>defobuflimit </b><i>limit</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Same as the <b>obuflimit</b> command except that the default
    setting for new displays is changed. Initial setting is 256 bytes. Note that
    you can use the special 'OL' terminal capability if you want to have a
    dependency on the terminal type.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>defscrollback </b><i>num</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Same as the <b>scrollback</b> command except that the default
    setting for new windows is changed. Initial setting is 100.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>defshell </b><i>command</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Synonym to the <b>shell</b> command. See there.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>defsilence on</b>|<b>off</b></p>
<p class="Pp">Same as the <b>silence</b> command except that the default setting
    for new windows is changed. Initial setting is `off'.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>defslowpaste </b><i>msec&quot;</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Same as the <b>slowpaste</b> command except that the default
    setting for new windows is changed. Initial setting is 0 milliseconds,
    meaning `off'.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>defutf8 on</b>|<b>off</b></p>
<p class="Pp">Same as the <b>utf8</b> command except that the default setting
    for new windows is changed. Initial setting is `on' if screen was started
    with &quot;-U&quot;, otherwise `off'.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>defwrap on</b>|<b>off</b></p>
<p class="Pp">Same as the <b>wrap</b> command except that the default setting
    for new windows is changed. Initially line-wrap is on and can be toggled
    with the &quot;wrap&quot; command (&quot;C-a r&quot;) or by means of
    &quot;C-a : wrap on|off&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>defwritelock on</b>|<b>off</b>|<b>auto</b></p>
<p class="Pp">Same as the <b>writelock</b> command except that the default
    setting for new windows is changed. Initially writelocks will off.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>defzombie </b>[<i>keys</i>]</p>
<p class="Pp">Synonym to the <b>zombie</b> command. Both currently change the
    default. See there.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>detach</b> [<b>-h</b>]</p>
<p class="Pp">Detach the <i>screen</i> session (disconnect it from the terminal
    and put it into the background). This returns you to the shell where you
    invoked <i>screen</i>. A detached <i>screen</i> can be resumed by invoking
    <i>screen</i> with the <b>-r</b> option (see also section &quot;COMMAND-LINE
    OPTIONS&quot;). The <b>-h</b> option tells screen to immediately close the
    connection to the terminal (&quot;hangup&quot;).</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>dinfo</b></p>
<p class="Pp">Show what screen thinks about your terminal. Useful if you want to
    know why features like color or the alternate charset don't work.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>displays</b></p>
<p class="Pp">Shows a tabular listing of all currently connected user front-ends
    (displays). This is most useful for multiuser sessions.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>digraph </b>[<b><i>preset</i></b><i>]</i></p>
<p class="Pp">This command prompts the user for a digraph sequence. The next two
    characters typed are looked up in a builtin table and the resulting
    character is inserted in the input stream. For example, if the user enters
    'a&quot;', an a-umlaut will be inserted. If the first character entered is a
    0 (zero), <i>screen</i> will treat the following characters (up to three) as
    an octal number instead. The optional argument <i>preset</i> is treated as
    user input, thus one can create an &quot;umlaut&quot; key. For example the
    command &quot;bindkey ^K digraph '&quot;'&quot; enables the user to generate
    an a-umlaut by typing CTRL-K a.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>dumptermcap</b></p>
<p class="Pp">Write the termcap entry for the virtual terminal optimized for the
    currently active window to the file &quot;.termcap&quot; in the user's
    &quot;$HOME/.screen&quot; directory (or wherever <i>screen</i> stores its
    sockets. See the &quot;FILES&quot; section below). This termcap entry is
    identical to the value of the environment variable $TERMCAP that is set up
    by <i>screen</i> for each window. For terminfo based systems you will need
    to run a converter like <i>captoinfo</i> and then compile the entry with
    <i>tic</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>echo </b>[<b>-n</b>] <i>message</i></p>
<p class="Pp">The echo command may be used to annoy <i>screen</i> users with a
    'message of the day'. Typically installed in a global /local/etc/screenrc.
    The option &quot;-n&quot; may be used to suppress the line feed. See also
    &quot;sleep&quot;. Echo is also useful for online checking of environment
    variables.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>encoding </b><i>enc</i> [<i>enc</i>]</p>
<p class="Pp">Tell <i>screen</i> how to interpret the input/output. The first
    argument sets the encoding of the current window. Each window can emulate a
    different encoding. The optional second parameter overwrites the encoding of
    the connected terminal. It should never be needed as screen uses the locale
    setting to detect the encoding. There is also a way to select a terminal
    encoding depending on the terminal type by using the &quot;KJ&quot; termcap
    entry.</p>
<p class="Pp">Supported encodings are eucJP, SJIS, eucKR, eucCN, Big5, GBK,
    KOI8-R, CP1251, UTF-8, ISO8859-2, ISO8859-3, ISO8859-4, ISO8859-5,
    ISO8859-6, ISO8859-7, ISO8859-8, ISO8859-9, ISO8859-10, ISO8859-15, jis.</p>
<p class="Pp">See also &quot;defencoding&quot;, which changes the default
    setting of a new window.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>escape </b><i>xy</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Set the command character to <i>x</i> and the character generating
    a literal command character (by triggering the &quot;meta&quot; command) to
    <i>y</i> (similar to the -e option). Each argument is either a single
    character, a two-character sequence of the form &quot;^x&quot; (meaning
    &quot;C-x&quot;), a backslash followed by an octal number (specifying the
    ASCII code of the character), or a backslash followed by a second character,
    such as &quot;\^&quot; or &quot;\\&quot;. The default is
  &quot;^Aa&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>eval</b> <i>command1</i> [<i>command2</i> <i>...</i>]</p>
<p class="Pp">Parses and executes each argument as separate command.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>exec</b> [[<i>fdpat</i>] <i>newcommand </i>[<i>args
  ...</i>]]</p>
<p class="Pp">Run a unix subprocess (specified by an executable path
    <i>newcommand</i> and its optional arguments) in the current window. The
    flow of data between newcommands stdin/stdout/stderr, the process originally
    started in the window (let us call it &quot;application-process&quot;) and
    screen itself (window) is controlled by the filedescriptor pattern fdpat.
    This pattern is basically a three character sequence representing stdin,
    stdout and stderr of newcommand. A dot (.) connects the file descriptor to
    <i>screen</i>. An exclamation mark (!) causes the file descriptor to be
    connected to the application-process. A colon (:) combines both. User input
    will go to newcommand unless newcommand receives the application-process'
    output (fdpats first character is `!' or `:') or a pipe symbol (|) is added
    (as a fourth character) to the end of fdpat.
  <br/>
  Invoking `exec' without arguments shows name and arguments of the currently
    running subprocess in this window. Only one subprocess a time can be running
    in each window.
  <br/>
  When a subprocess is running the `kill' command will affect it instead of the
    windows process.
  <br/>
  Refer to the postscript file `doc/fdpat.ps' for a confusing illustration of
    all 21 possible combinations. Each drawing shows the digits 2,1,0
    representing the three file descriptors of newcommand. The box marked `W' is
    the usual pty that has the application-process on its slave side. The box
    marked `P' is the secondary pty that now has <i>screen</i> at its master
    side.</p>
<p class="Pp">Abbreviations:
  <br/>
  Whitespace between the word `exec' and fdpat and the command can be omitted.
    Trailing dots and a fdpat consisting only of dots can be omitted. A simple
    `|' is synonymous for the pattern `!..|'; the word exec can be omitted here
    and can always be replaced by `!'.</p>
<p class="Pp">Examples:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>exec ... /bin/sh
    <br/>
    exec /bin/sh
    <br/>
    !/bin/sh</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Creates another shell in the same window, while the original shell
    is still running. Output of both shells is displayed and user input is sent
    to the new /bin/sh.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>exec !.. stty 19200
    <br/>
    exec ! stty 19200
    <br/>
    !!stty 19200</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Set the speed of the window's tty. If your stty command operates
    on stdout, then add another `!'.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>exec !..| less
    <br/>
    |less</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">This adds a pager to the window output. The special character `|'
    is needed to give the user control over the pager although it gets its input
    from the window's process. This works, because <i>less</i> listens on stderr
    (a behavior that <i>screen</i> would not expect without the `|') when its
    stdin is not a tty. <i>Less</i> versions newer than 177 fail miserably here;
    good old <i>pg</i> still works.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>!:sed -n s/.*Error.*/\007/p</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Sends window output to both, the user and the sed command. The sed
    inserts an additional bell character (oct. 007) to the window output seen by
    <i>screen</i>. This will cause &quot;Bell in window x&quot; messages,
    whenever the string &quot;Error&quot; appears in the window.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>fit</b></p>
<p class="Pp">Change the window size to the size of the current region. This
    command is needed because screen doesn't adapt the window size automatically
    if the window is displayed more than once.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>flow</b> [<b>on</b>|<b>off</b>|<b>auto]</b></p>
<p class="Pp">Sets the flow-control mode for this window. Without parameters it
    cycles the current window's flow-control setting from &quot;automatic&quot;
    to &quot;on&quot; to &quot;off&quot;. See the discussion on
    &quot;FLOW-CONTROL&quot; later on in this document for full details and
    note, that this is subject to change in future releases. Default is set by
    `defflow'.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>focus </b>[<b>up</b>|<b>down</b>|<b>top</b>|<b>bottom</b>]</p>
<p class="Pp">Move the input focus to the next region. This is done in a cyclic
    way so that the top region is selected after the bottom one. If no
    subcommand is given it defaults to `down'. `up' cycles in the opposite
    order, `top' and `bottom' go to the top and bottom region respectively.
    Useful bindings are (j and k as in vi)</p>
<pre>
    bind j focus down
    bind k focus up
    bind t focus top
    bind b focus bottom
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><b>gr </b>[<b>on</b>|<b>off</b>]</p>
<p class="Pp">Turn GR charset switching on/off. Whenever screen sees an input
    character with the 8th bit set, it will use the charset stored in the GR
    slot and print the character with the 8th bit stripped. The default (see
    also &quot;defgr&quot;) is not to process GR switching because otherwise the
    ISO88591 charset would not work.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>hardcopy</b> [<b>-h</b>] [<i>file</i>]</p>
<p class="Pp">Writes out the currently displayed image to the file <i>file</i>,
    or, if no filename is specified, to <i>hardcopy.n</i> in the default
    directory, where <i>n</i> is the number of the current window. This either
    appends or overwrites the file if it exists. See below. If the option
    <b>-h</b> is specified, dump also the contents of the scrollback buffer.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>hardcopy_append on</b>|<b>off</b></p>
<p class="Pp">If set to &quot;on&quot;, <i>screen</i> will append to the
    &quot;hardcopy.n&quot; files created by the command &quot;C-a h&quot;,
    otherwise these files are overwritten each time. Default is `off'.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>hardcopydir </b><i>directory</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Defines a directory where hardcopy files will be placed. If unset,
    hardcopys are dumped in <i>screen</i>'s current working directory.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>hardstatus </b>[<b>on</b>|<b>off</b>]
  <br/>
  <b>hardstatus
    [<b>always</b>]<b>lastline</b></b><b>|</b><b><b>message</b></b><b>|</b><b><b>ignore</b></b>
    [<i>string</i>]
  <br/>
  <b>hardstatus string</b> [<i>string</i>]</p>
<p class="Pp">This command configures the use and emulation of the terminal's
    hardstatus line. The first form toggles whether <i>screen</i> will use the
    hardware status line to display messages. If the flag is set to `off', these
    messages are overlaid in reverse video mode at the display line. The default
    setting is `on'.</p>
<p class="Pp">The second form tells <i>screen</i> what to do if the terminal
    doesn't have a hardstatus line (i.e. the termcap/terminfo capabilities
    &quot;hs&quot;, &quot;ts&quot;, &quot;fs&quot; and &quot;ds&quot; are not
    set). If the type &quot;lastline&quot; is used, <i>screen</i> will reserve
    the last line of the display for the hardstatus. &quot;message&quot; uses
    <i>screen's</i> message mechanism and &quot;ignore&quot; tells <i>screen</i>
    never to display the hardstatus. If you prepend the word &quot;always&quot;
    to the type (e.g., &quot;alwayslastline&quot;), <i>screen</i> will use the
    type even if the terminal supports a hardstatus.</p>
<p class="Pp">The third form specifies the contents of the hardstatus line. '%h'
    is used as default string, i.e. the stored hardstatus of the current window
    (settable via &quot;ESC]0;&lt;string&gt;^G&quot; or
    &quot;ESC_&lt;string&gt;ESC\&quot;) is displayed. You can customize this to
    any string you like including the escapes from the &quot;STRING
    ESCAPES&quot; chapter. If you leave out the argument <i>string</i>, the
    current string is displayed.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can mix the second and third form by providing the string as
    additional argument.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>height</b> [<b>-w</b>|<b>-d</b>] [<i>lines</i>
  [<i>cols</i>]]</p>
<p class="Pp">Set the display height to a specified number of lines. When no
    argument is given it toggles between 24 and 42 lines display. You can also
    specify a width if you want to change both values. The <b>-w</b> option
    tells screen to leave the display size unchanged and just set the window
    size, <b>-d</b> vice versa.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>help</b> [<b>-c</b> <i>class</i>]</p>
<p class="Pp">Not really a online help, but displays a help <i>screen</i>
    showing you all the key bindings. The first pages list all the internal
    commands followed by their current bindings. Subsequent pages will display
    the custom commands, one command per key. Press space when you're done
    reading each page, or return to exit early. All other characters are
    ignored. If the &quot;-c&quot; option is given, display all bound commands
    for the specified command class. See also &quot;DEFAULT KEY BINDINGS&quot;
    section.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>history</b></p>
<p class="Pp">Usually users work with a shell that allows easy access to
    previous commands. For example csh has the command &quot;!!&quot; to repeat
    the last command executed. <i>Screen</i> allows you to have a primitive way
    of re-calling &quot;the command that started ...&quot;: You just type the
    first letter of that command, then hit `C-a {' and <i>screen</i> tries to
    find a previous line that matches with the `prompt character' to the left of
    the cursor. This line is pasted into this window's input queue. Thus you
    have a crude command history (made up by the visible window and its
    scrollback buffer).</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>hstatus </b><i>status</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Change the window's hardstatus line to the string
  <i>status</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>idle</b> [<i>timeout</i> [<i>cmd args</i>]]</p>
<p class="Pp">Sets a command that is run after the specified number of seconds
    inactivity is reached. This command will normally be the &quot;blanker&quot;
    command to create a screen blanker, but it can be any screen command. If no
    command is specified, only the timeout is set. A timeout of zero (ot the
    special timeout <b>off</b>) disables the timer. If no arguments are given,
    the current settings are displayed.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>ignorecase </b>[<b>on</b>|<b>off</b>]</p>
<p class="Pp">Tell screen to ignore the case of characters in searches. Default
    is `off'.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>info</b></p>
<p class="Pp">Uses the message line to display some information about the
    current window: the cursor position in the form &quot;(column,row)&quot;
    starting with &quot;(1,1)&quot;, the terminal width and height plus the size
    of the scrollback buffer in lines, like in &quot;(80,24)+50&quot;, the
    current state of window XON/XOFF flow control is shown like this (See also
    section FLOW CONTROL):</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
  +flow     automatic flow control, currently on.
  -flow     automatic flow control, currently off.
  +(+)flow  flow control enabled. Agrees with automatic control.
  -(+)flow  flow control disabled. Disagrees with automatic control.
  +(-)flow  flow control enabled. Disagrees with automatic control.
  -(-)flow  flow control disabled. Agrees with automatic control.
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The current line wrap setting (`+wrap' indicates enabled, `-wrap'
    not) is also shown. The flags `ins', `org', `app', `log', `mon' or `nored'
    are displayed when the window is in insert mode, origin mode,
    application-keypad mode, has output logging, activity monitoring or partial
    redraw enabled.</p>
<p class="Pp">The currently active character set (<i>G0</i>, <i>G1</i>,
    <i>G2</i>, or <i>G3</i>) and in square brackets the terminal character sets
    that are currently designated as <i>G0</i> through <i>G3</i> is shown. If
    the window is in UTF-8 mode, the string &quot;UTF-8&quot; is shown
  instead.</p>
<p class="Pp">Additional modes depending on the type of the window are displayed
    at the end of the status line (See also chapter &quot;WINDOW TYPES&quot;).
  <br/>
  If the state machine of the terminal emulator is in a non-default state, the
    info line is started with a string identifying the current state.
  <br/>
  For system information use the &quot;time&quot; command.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>ins_reg</b> [<b><i>key</i></b><i>]</i></p>
<p class="Pp">No longer exists, use &quot;paste&quot; instead.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>kill</b></p>
<p class="Pp">Kill current window.
  <br/>
  If there is an `exec' command running then it is killed. Otherwise the process
    (shell) running in the window receives a HANGUP condition, the window
    structure is removed and <i>screen</i> (your display) switches to another
    window. When the last window is destroyed, <i>screen</i> exits. After a kill
    <i>screen</i> switches to the previously displayed window.
  <br/>
  Note: <i>Emacs</i> users should keep this command in mind, when killing a
    line. It is recommended not to use &quot;C-a&quot; as the <i>screen</i>
    escape key or to rebind kill to &quot;C-a K&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>lastmsg</b></p>
<p class="Pp">Redisplay the last contents of the message/status line. Useful if
    you're typing when a message appears, because the message goes away when you
    press a key (unless your terminal has a hardware status line). Refer to the
    commands &quot;msgwait&quot; and &quot;msgminwait&quot; for fine tuning.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>license</b></p>
<p class="Pp">Display the disclaimer page. This is done whenever <i>screen</i>
    is started without options, which should be often enough. See also the
    &quot;startup_message&quot; command.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>lockscreen</b></p>
<p class="Pp">Lock this display. Call a screenlock program (/local/bin/lck or
    /usr/bin/lock or a builtin if no other is available). Screen does not accept
    any command keys until this program terminates. Meanwhile processes in the
    windows may continue, as the windows are in the `detached' state. The
    screenlock program may be changed through the environment variable $LOCKPRG
    (which must be set in the shell from which <i>screen</i> is started) and is
    executed with the user's uid and gid.
  <br/>
  Warning: When you leave other shells unlocked and you have no password set on
    <i>screen</i>, the lock is void: One could easily re-attach from an unlocked
    shell. This feature should rather be called `lockterminal'.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>log </b>[<b>on</b>|<b>off</b>]</p>
<p class="Pp">Start/stop writing output of the current window to a file
    &quot;screenlog.<i>n</i>&quot; in the window's default directory, where
    <i>n</i> is the number of the current window. This filename can be changed
    with the `logfile' command. If no parameter is given, the state of logging
    is toggled. The session log is appended to the previous contents of the file
    if it already exists. The current contents and the contents of the
    scrollback history are not included in the session log. Default is
  `off'.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>logfile </b><i>filename</i>
  <br/>
  <b>logfile flush </b><i>secs</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Defines the name the logfiles will get. The default is
    &quot;screenlog.%n&quot;. The second form changes the number of seconds
    <i>screen</i> will wait before flushing the logfile buffer to the
    file-system. The default value is 10 seconds.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>login </b>[<b>on</b>|<b>off</b>]</p>
<p class="Pp">Adds or removes the entry in the utmp database file for the
    current window. This controls if the window is `logged in'. When no
    parameter is given, the login state of the window is toggled. Additionally
    to that toggle, it is convenient having a `log in' and a `log out' key. E.g.
    `bind I login on' and `bind O login off' will map these keys to be C-a I and
    C-a O. The default setting (in config.h.in) should be &quot;on&quot; for a
    <i>screen</i> that runs under suid-root. Use the &quot;deflogin&quot;
    command to change the default login state for new windows. Both commands are
    only present when <i>screen</i> has been compiled with utmp support.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>logtstamp </b>[<b>on</b>|<b>off</b>]
  <br/>
  <b>logtstamp after</b> [<i>secs</i>]
  <br/>
  <b>logtstamp string</b> [<i>string</i>]</p>
<p class="Pp">This command controls logfile time-stamp mechanism of
    <i>screen.</i> If time-stamps are turned &quot;on&quot;, <i>screen</i> adds
    a string containing the current time to the logfile after two minutes of
    inactivity. When output continues and more than another two minutes have
    passed, a second time-stamp is added to document the restart of the output.
    You can change this timeout with the second form of the command. The third
    form is used for customizing the time-stamp string (`-- %n:%t -- time-stamp
    -- %M/%d/%y %c:%s --\n' by default).</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>mapdefault</b></p>
<p class="Pp">Tell <i>screen</i> that the next input character should only be
    looked up in the default bindkey table. See also &quot;bindkey&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>mapnotnext</b></p>
<p class="Pp">Like mapdefault, but don't even look in the default bindkey
  table.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>maptimeout</b> [<i>timo</i>]</p>
<p class="Pp">Set the inter-character timer for input sequence detection to a
    timeout of <i>timo</i> ms. The default timeout is 300ms. Maptimeout with no
    arguments shows the current setting. See also &quot;bindkey&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>markkeys </b><i>string</i></p>
<p class="Pp">This is a method of changing the keymap used for copy/history
    mode. The string is made up of <i>oldchar</i>=<i>newchar</i> pairs which are
    separated by `:'. Example: The string &quot;B=^B:F=^F&quot; will change the
    keys `C-b' and `C-f' to the vi style binding (scroll up/down fill page).
    This happens to be the default binding for `B' and `F'. The command
    &quot;markkeys h=^B:l=^F:$=^E&quot; would set the mode for an emacs-style
    binding. If your terminal sends characters, that cause you to abort copy
    mode, then this command may help by binding these characters to do nothing.
    The no-op character is `@' and is used like this: &quot;markkeys @=L=H&quot;
    if you do not want to use the `H' or `L' commands any longer. As shown in
    this example, multiple keys can be assigned to one function in a single
    statement.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>maxwin </b><i>num</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Set the maximum window number screen will create. Doesn't affect
    already existing windows. The number may only be decreased.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>meta</b></p>
<p class="Pp">Insert the command character (C-a) in the current window's input
    stream.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>monitor </b>[<b>on</b>|<b>off</b>]</p>
<p class="Pp">Toggles activity monitoring of windows. When monitoring is turned
    on and an affected window is switched into the background, you will receive
    the activity notification message in the status line at the first sign of
    output and the window will also be marked with an `@' in the window-status
    display. Monitoring is initially off for all windows.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>msgminwait </b><i>sec</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Defines the time <i>screen</i> delays a new message when one
    message is currently displayed. The default is 1 second.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>msgwait </b><i>sec</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Defines the time a message is displayed if <i>screen</i> is not
    disturbed by other activity. The default is 5 seconds.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>multiuser on</b>|<b>off</b></p>
<p class="Pp">Switch between singleuser and multiuser mode. Standard
    <i>screen</i> operation is singleuser. In multiuser mode the commands
    `acladd', `aclchg', `aclgrp' and `acldel' can be used to enable (and
    disable) other users accessing this <i>screen</i> session.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>nethack on</b>|<b>off</b></p>
<p class="Pp">Changes the kind of error messages used by <i>screen</i>. When you
    are familiar with the game &quot;nethack&quot;, you may enjoy the
    nethack-style messages which will often blur the facts a little, but are
    much funnier to read. Anyway, standard messages often tend to be unclear as
    well.
  <br/>
  This option is only available if <i>screen</i> was compiled with the NETHACK
    flag defined. The default setting is then determined by the presence of the
    environment variable $NETHACKOPTIONS.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>next</b></p>
<p class="Pp">Switch to the next window. This command can be used repeatedly to
    cycle through the list of windows.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>nonblock</b>
    [<b>on</b>|<b>off</b>|<b><i>numsecs</i></b><i>]</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Tell screen how to deal with user interfaces (displays) that cease
    to accept output. This can happen if a user presses ^S or a TCP/modem
    connection gets cut but no hangup is received. If nonblock is <b>off</b>
    (this is the default) screen waits until the display restarts to accept the
    output. If nonblock is <b>on</b>, screen waits until the timeout is reached
    (<b>on</b> is treated as 1s). If the display still doesn't receive
    characters, screen will consider it &quot;blocked&quot; and stop sending
    characters to it. If at some time it restarts to accept characters, screen
    will unblock the display and redisplay the updated window contents.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>number </b>[<b><i>n</i></b><i>]</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Change the current windows number. If the given number <i>n</i> is
    already used by another window, both windows exchange their numbers. If no
    argument is specified, the current window number (and title) is shown.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>obuflimit </b>[<b><i>limit</i></b><i>]</i></p>
<p class="Pp">If the output buffer contains more bytes than the specified limit,
    no more data will be read from the windows. The default value is 256. If you
    have a fast display (like xterm), you can set it to some higher value. If no
    argument is specified, the current setting is displayed.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>only</b></p>
<p class="Pp">Kill all regions but the current one.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>other</b></p>
<p class="Pp">Switch to the window displayed previously. If this window does no
    longer exist, <i>other</i> has the same effect as <i>next</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>partial on</b>|<b>off</b></p>
<p class="Pp">Defines whether the display should be refreshed (as with
    <i>redisplay</i>) after switching to the current window. This command only
    affects the current window. To immediately affect all windows use the
    <i>allpartial</i> command. Default is `off', of course. This default is
    fixed, as there is currently no <i>defpartial</i> command.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>password </b>[<b><i>crypted_pw</i></b><i>]</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Present a crypted password in your &quot;.screenrc&quot; file and
    <i>screen</i> will ask for it, whenever someone attempts to resume a
    detached. This is useful if you have privileged programs running under
    <i>screen</i> and you want to protect your session from reattach attempts by
    another user masquerading as your uid (i.e. any superuser.) If no crypted
    password is specified, <i>screen</i> prompts twice for typing a password and
    places its encryption in the paste buffer. Default is `none', this disables
    password checking.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>paste</b> [<i>registers</i> [<i>dest_reg</i>]]</p>
<p class="Pp">Write the (concatenated) contents of the specified registers to
    the stdin queue of the current window. The register '.' is treated as the
    paste buffer. If no parameter is given the user is prompted for a single
    register to paste. The paste buffer can be filled with the <i>copy</i>,
    <i>history</i> and <i>readbuf</i> commands. Other registers can be filled
    with the <i>register</i>, <i>readreg</i> and <i>paste</i> commands. If
    <i>paste</i> is called with a second argument, the contents of the specified
    registers is pasted into the named destination register rather than the
    window. If '.' is used as the second argument, the displays paste buffer is
    the destination. Note, that &quot;paste&quot; uses a wide variety of
    resources: Whenever a second argument is specified no current window is
    needed. When the source specification only contains registers (not the paste
    buffer) then there need not be a current display (terminal attached), as the
    registers are a global resource. The paste buffer exists once for every
    user.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>pastefont </b>[<b>on</b>|<b>off</b>]</p>
<p class="Pp">Tell <i>screen</i> to include font information in the paste
    buffer. The default is not to do so. This command is especially useful for
    multi character fonts like kanji.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>pow_break</b></p>
<p class="Pp">Reopen the window's terminal line and send a break condition. See
    `break'.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>pow_detach</b></p>
<p class="Pp">Power detach. Mainly the same as <i>detach</i>, but also sends a
    HANGUP signal to the parent process of <i>screen</i>. CAUTION: This will
    result in a logout, when <i>screen</i> was started from your login
  shell.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>pow_detach_msg</b> [<i>message</i>]</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>message</i> specified here is output whenever a `Power
    detach' was performed. It may be used as a replacement for a logout message
    or to reset baud rate, etc. Without parameter, the current message is
  shown.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>prev</b></p>
<p class="Pp">Switch to the window with the next lower number. This command can
    be used repeatedly to cycle through the list of windows.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>printcmd</b> [<i>cmd</i>]</p>
<p class="Pp">If <i>cmd</i> is not an empty string, <i>screen</i> will not use
    the terminal capabilities &quot;po/pf&quot; if it detects an ansi print
    sequence <b>ESC [ 5 i</b>, but pipe the output into <i>cmd</i>. This should
    normally be a command like &quot;lpr&quot; or &quot;'cat &gt;
    /tmp/scrprint'&quot;. <b>printcmd</b> without a command displays the current
    setting. The ansi sequence <b>ESC \</b> ends printing and closes the pipe.
  <br/>
  Warning: Be careful with this command! If other user have write access to your
    terminal, they will be able to fire off print commands.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>process</b> [<b><i>key</i></b><i>]</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Stuff the contents of the specified register into <i>screen</i>'s
    input queue. If no argument is given you are prompted for a register name.
    The text is parsed as if it had been typed in from the user's keyboard. This
    command can be used to bind multiple actions to a single key.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>quit</b></p>
<p class="Pp">Kill all windows and terminate <i>screen</i>. Note that on
    VT100-style terminals the keys C-4 and C-\ are identical. This makes the
    default bindings dangerous: Be careful not to type C-a C-4 when selecting
    window no. 4. Use the empty bind command (as in &quot;bind '^\'&quot;) to
    remove a key binding.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>readbuf</b> [<b>-e</b> <i>encoding</i>] [<i>filename</i>]</p>
<p class="Pp">Reads the contents of the specified file into the paste buffer.
    You can tell screen the encoding of the file via the <b>-e</b> option. If no
    file is specified, the screen-exchange filename is used. See also
    &quot;bufferfile&quot; command.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>readreg</b> [<b>-e</b> <i>encoding</i>] [<i>register</i>
    [<i>filename</i>]]</p>
<p class="Pp">Does one of two things, dependent on number of arguments: with
    zero or one arguments it it duplicates the paste buffer contents into the
    register specified or entered at the prompt. With two arguments it reads the
    contents of the named file into the register, just as <i>readbuf</i> reads
    the screen-exchange file into the paste buffer. You can tell screen the
    encoding of the file via the <b>-e</b> option. The following example will
    paste the system's password file into the <i>screen</i> window (using
    register p, where a copy remains):</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
	C-a : readreg p /etc/passwd
	C-a : paste p
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><b>redisplay</b></p>
<p class="Pp">Redisplay the current window. Needed to get a full redisplay when
    in partial redraw mode.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>register</b> [<b>-e</b> <i>encoding</i>] <i>key string</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Save the specified <i>string</i> to the register <i>key</i>. The
    encoding of the string can be specified via the <b>-e</b> option. See also
    the &quot;paste&quot; command.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>remove</b></p>
<p class="Pp">Kill the current region. This is a no-op if there is only one
    region.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>removebuf</b></p>
<p class="Pp">Unlinks the screen-exchange file used by the commands
    &quot;writebuf&quot; and &quot;readbuf&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>reset</b></p>
<p class="Pp">Reset the virtual terminal to its &quot;power-on&quot; values.
    Useful when strange settings (like scroll regions or graphics character set)
    are left over from an application.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>resize</b></p>
<p class="Pp">Resize the current region. The space will be removed from or added
    to the region below or if there's not enough space from the region
  above.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>resize +N	increase current region height by N</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>resize -N	decrease current region height by N</dd>
  <dt></dt>

</dl>
<p class="Pp"><b>screen <b>[</b><i>-opts</i><b>] [</b><i>n</i><b>]
    [</b><i>cmd</i> <b> [</b><i>args</i><b>]]</b></b></p>
<p class="Pp">Establish a new window. The flow-control options (<b>-f</b>,
    <b>-fn</b> and <b>-fa</b>), title (a.k.a.) option (<b>-t</b>), login options
    (<b>-l</b> and <b>-ln</b>) , terminal type option (<b>-T</b> &lt;term&gt;),
    the all-capability-flag (<b>-a</b>) and scrollback option (<b>-h</b>
    &lt;num&gt;) may be specified with each command. The option (<b>-M</b>)
    turns monitoring on for this window. The option (<b>-L</b>) turns output
    logging on for this window. If an optional number <i>n</i> in the range 0..9
    is given, the window number <i>n</i> is assigned to the newly created window
    (or, if this number is already in-use, the next available number). If a
    command is specified after &quot;screen&quot;, this command (with the given
    arguments) is started in the window; otherwise, a shell is created. Thus, if
    your &quot;.screenrc&quot; contains the lines</p>

<p class="Pp"><i>screen</i> creates a shell window (in window #1) and a window
    with a TELNET connection to the machine foobar (with no flow-control using
    the title &quot;foobar&quot; in window #2) and will write a logfile
    (&quot;screenlog.2&quot;) of the telnet session. Note, that unlike previous
    versions of <i>screen</i> no additional default window is created when
    &quot;screen&quot; commands are included in your &quot;.screenrc&quot; file.
    When the initialization is completed, <i>screen</i> switches to the last
    window specified in your .screenrc file or, if none, opens a default window
    #0.
  <br/>
  Screen has built in some functionality of &quot;cu&quot; and
    &quot;telnet&quot;. See also chapter &quot;WINDOW TYPES&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>scrollback <i></i><i>num</i><i></i></b></p>
<p class="Pp">Set the size of the scrollback buffer for the current windows to
    <i>num</i> lines. The default scrollback is 100 lines. See also the
    &quot;defscrollback&quot; command and use &quot;C-a i&quot; to view the
    current setting.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>select </b>[<b><i>WindowID</i></b><i>]</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Switch to the window identified by <i>WindowID</i>. This can be a
    prefix of a window title (alphanumeric window name) or a window number. The
    parameter is optional and if omitted, you get prompted for an identifier.
    When a new window is established, the first available number is assigned to
    this window. Thus, the first window can be activated by &quot;select
    0&quot;. The number of windows is limited at compile-time by the MAXWIN
    configuration parameter. There are two special WindowIDs, &quot;-&quot;
    selects the internal blank window and &quot;.&quot; selects the current
    window. The latter is useful if used with screen's &quot;-X&quot;
  option.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>sessionname </b>[<b><i>name</i></b><i>]</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Rename the current session. Note, that for &quot;screen
    -list&quot; the name shows up with the process-id prepended. If the argument
    &quot;name&quot; is omitted, the name of this session is displayed. Caution:
    The $STY environment variables still reflects the old name. This may result
    in confusion. The default is constructed from the tty and host names.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>setenv </b> [<i>var</i> [<i>string</i>]]</p>
<p class="Pp">Set the environment variable <i>var</i> to value <i>string</i>. If
    only <i>var</i> is specified, the user will be prompted to enter a value. If
    no parameters are specified, the user will be prompted for both variable and
    value. The environment is inherited by all subsequently forked shells.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>setsid </b>[<b>on</b>|<b>off</b>]</p>
<p class="Pp">Normally screen uses different sessions and process groups for the
    windows. If setsid is turned <i>off</i>, this is not done anymore and all
    windows will be in the same process group as the screen backend process.
    This also breaks job-control, so be careful. The default is <i>on</i>, of
    course. This command is probably useful only in rare circumstances.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>shell <i>command</i></b></p>
<p class="Pp">Set the command to be used to create a new shell. This overrides
    the value of the environment variable $SHELL. This is useful if you'd like
    to run a tty-enhancer which is expecting to execute the program specified in
    $SHELL. If the command begins with a '-' character, the shell will be
    started as a login-shell.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>shelltitle <i>title</i></b></p>
<p class="Pp">Set the title for all shells created during startup or by the C-A
    C-c command. For details about what a title is, see the discussion entitled
    &quot;TITLES (naming windows)&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>silence </b>[<b>on</b>|<b>off</b>|<i>sec</i>]</p>
<p class="Pp">Toggles silence monitoring of windows. When silence is turned on
    and an affected window is switched into the background, you will receive the
    silence notification message in the status line after a specified period of
    inactivity (silence). The default timeout can be changed with the
    `silencewait' command or by specifying a number of seconds instead of `on'
    or `off'. Silence is initially off for all windows.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>silencewait </b><i>sec</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Define the time that all windows monitored for silence should wait
    before displaying a message. Default 30 seconds.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>sleep <i></i><i>num</i><i></i></b></p>
<p class="Pp">This command will pause the execution of a .screenrc file for
    <i>num</i> seconds. Keyboard activity will end the sleep. It may be used to
    give users a chance to read the messages output by &quot;echo&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>slowpaste <i>msec</i></b></p>
<p class="Pp">Define the speed at which text is inserted into the current window
    by the paste (&quot;C-a ]&quot;) command. If the slowpaste value is nonzero
    text is written character by character. <i>screen</i> will make a pause of
    <i>msec</i> milliseconds after each single character write to allow the
    application to process its input. Only use slowpaste if your underlying
    system exposes flow control problems while pasting large amounts of
  text.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>source </b><i>file</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Read and execute commands from file <i>file</i>. Source commands
    may be nested to a maximum recursion level of ten. If file is not an
    absolute path and screen is already processing a source command, the parent
    directory of the running source command file is used to search for the new
    command file before screen's current directory.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that termcap/terminfo/termcapinfo commands only work at
    startup and reattach time, so they must be reached via the default screenrc
    files to have an effect.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>sorendition</b> [<b><i>attr</i>
    </b>[<b><i>color</i></b><i>]]</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Change the way <i>screen</i> does highlighting for text marking
    and printing messages. See the &quot;STRING ESCAPES&quot; chapter for the
    syntax of the modifiers. The default is currently &quot;=s dd&quot;
    (standout, default colors).</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>split</b></p>
<p class="Pp">Split the current region into two new ones. All regions on the
    display are resized to make room for the new region. The blank window is
    displayed on the new region. Use the &quot;remove&quot; or the
    &quot;only&quot; command to delete regions.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>startup_message on<i>|</i><b>off</b></b></p>
<p class="Pp">Select whether you want to see the copyright notice during
    startup. Default is `on', as you probably noticed.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>stuff</b> <i>string</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Stuff the string <i>string</i> in the input buffer of the current
    window. This is like the &quot;paste&quot; command but with much less
    overhead. You cannot paste large buffers with the &quot;stuff&quot; command.
    It is most useful for key bindings. See also &quot;bindkey&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>su</b> [<b>username</b> [<b>password</b>
  [<b>password2</b>]]</p>
<p class="Pp">Substitute the user of a display. The command prompts for all
    parameters that are omitted. If passwords are specified as parameters, they
    have to be specified un-crypted. The first password is matched against the
    systems passwd database, the second password is matched against the
    <i>screen</i> password as set with the commands &quot;acladd&quot; or
    &quot;password&quot;. &quot;Su&quot; may be useful for the <i>screen</i>
    administrator to test multiuser setups. When the identification fails, the
    user has access to the commands available for user <b>nobody</b>. These are
    &quot;detach&quot;, &quot;license&quot;, &quot;version&quot;,
    &quot;help&quot; and &quot;displays&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>suspend</b></p>
<p class="Pp">Suspend <i>screen</i>. The windows are in the `detached' state,
    while <i>screen</i> is suspended. This feature relies on the shell being
    able to do job control.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>term <i>term</i></b></p>
<p class="Pp">In each window's environment <i>screen</i> opens, the $TERM
    variable is set to &quot;screen&quot; by default. But when no description
    for &quot;screen&quot; is installed in the local termcap or terminfo data
    base, you set $TERM to - say - &quot;vt100&quot;. This won't do much harm,
    as <i>screen</i> is VT100/ANSI compatible. The use of the &quot;term&quot;
    command is discouraged for non-default purpose. That is, one may want to
    specify special $TERM settings (e.g. vt100) for the next &quot;screen rlogin
    othermachine&quot; command. Use the command &quot;screen -T vt100 rlogin
    othermachine&quot; rather than setting and resetting the default.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>termcap</b><i> term terminal-tweaks</i> [<i>window-tweaks</i>]
  <br/>
  <b>terminfo</b><i> term terminal-tweaks</i> [<i>window-tweaks</i>]
  <br/>
  <b>termcapinfo</b><i> term terminal-tweaks</i> [<i>window-tweaks</i>]</p>
<p class="Pp">Use this command to modify your terminal's termcap entry without
    going through all the hassles involved in creating a custom termcap entry.
    Plus, you can optionally customize the termcap generated for the windows.
    You have to place these commands in one of the screenrc startup files, as
    they are meaningless once the terminal emulator is booted.
  <br/>
  If your system works uses the terminfo database rather than termcap,
    <i>screen</i> will understand the `terminfo' command, which has the same
    effects as the `termcap' command. Two separate commands are provided, as
    there are subtle syntactic differences, e.g. when parameter interpolation
    (using `%') is required. Note that termcap names of the capabilities have to
    be used with the `terminfo' command.
  <br/>
  In many cases, where the arguments are valid in both terminfo and termcap
    syntax, you can use the command `termcapinfo', which is just a shorthand for
    a pair of `termcap' and `terminfo' commands with identical arguments.</p>
<p class="Pp">The first argument specifies which terminal(s) should be affected
    by this definition. You can specify multiple terminal names by separating
    them with `|'s. Use `*' to match all terminals and `vt*' to match all
    terminals that begin with &quot;vt&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">Each <i>tweak</i> argument contains one or more termcap defines
    (separated by `:'s) to be inserted at the start of the appropriate termcap
    entry, enhancing it or overriding existing values. The first tweak modifies
    your terminal's termcap, and contains definitions that your terminal uses to
    perform certain functions. Specify a null string to leave this unchanged
    (e.g. ''). The second (optional) tweak modifies all the window termcaps, and
    should contain definitions that <i>screen</i> understands (see the
    &quot;VIRTUAL TERMINAL&quot; section).</p>
<p class="Pp">Some examples:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>termcap xterm* LP:hs@</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Informs <i>screen</i> that all terminals that begin with `xterm'
    have firm auto-margins that allow the last position on the screen to be
    updated (LP), but they don't really have a status line (no 'hs' - append `@'
    to turn entries off). Note that we assume `LP' for all terminal names that
    start with &quot;vt&quot;, but only if you don't specify a termcap command
    for that terminal.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>termcap vt* LP
    <br/>
    termcap vt102|vt220 Z0=\E[?3h:Z1=\E[?3l</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Specifies the firm-margined `LP' capability for all terminals that
    begin with `vt', and the second line will also add the escape-sequences to
    switch into (Z0) and back out of (Z1) 132-character-per-line mode if this is
    a VT102 or VT220. (You must specify Z0 and Z1 in your termcap to use the
    width-changing commands.)</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>termcap vt100 &quot;&quot; l0=PF1:l1=PF2:l2=PF3:l3=PF4</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">This leaves your vt100 termcap alone and adds the function key
    labels to each window's termcap entry.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>termcap h19|z19 am@:im=\E@:ei=\EO dc=\E[P</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Takes a h19 or z19 termcap and turns off auto-margins (am@) and
    enables the insert mode (im) and end-insert (ei) capabilities (the `@' in
    the `im' string is after the `=', so it is part of the string). Having the
    `im' and `ei' definitions put into your terminal's termcap will cause
    <i>screen</i> to automatically advertise the character-insert capability in
    each window's termcap. Each window will also get the delete-character
    capability (dc) added to its termcap, which <i>screen</i> will translate
    into a line-update for the terminal (we're pretending it doesn't support
    character deletion).</p>
<p class="Pp">If you would like to fully specify each window's termcap entry,
    you should instead set the $SCREENCAP variable prior to running
    <i>screen</i>. See the discussion on the &quot;VIRTUAL TERMINAL&quot; in
    this manual, and the termcap(5) man page for more information on termcap
    definitions.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>time</b> [<i>string</i>]</p>
<p class="Pp">Uses the message line to display the time of day, the host name,
    and the load averages over 1, 5, and 15 minutes (if this is available on
    your system). For window specific information use &quot;info&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">If a string is specified, it changes the format of the time report
    like it is described in the &quot;STRING ESCAPES&quot; chapter. Screen uses
    a default of &quot;%c:%s %M %d %H%? %l%?&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>title </b>[<b><i>windowtitle</i></b><i>]</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Set the name of the current window to <i>windowtitle</i>. If no
    name is specified, <i>screen</i> prompts for one. This command was known as
    `aka' in previous releases.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>unsetenv </b><i>var</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Unset an environment variable.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>utf8</b> [<b>on</b>|<b>off</b> [<b>on</b>|<b>off</b>]]</p>
<p class="Pp">Change the encoding used in the current window. If utf8 is
    enabled, the strings sent to the window will be UTF-8 encoded and vice
    versa. Omitting the parameter toggles the setting. If a second parameter is
    given, the display's encoding is also changed (this should rather be done
    with screen's &quot;-U&quot; option). See also &quot;defutf8&quot;, which
    changes the default setting of a new window.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>vbell</b> [<b>on</b>|<b>off</b>]</p>
<p class="Pp">Sets the visual bell setting for this window. Omitting the
    parameter toggles the setting. If vbell is switched on, but your terminal
    does not support a visual bell, a `vbell-message' is displayed in the status
    line when the bell character (^G) is received. Visual bell support of a
    terminal is defined by the termcap variable `vb' (terminfo: 'flash').
  <br/>
  Per default, vbell is off, thus the audible bell is used. See also
  `bell_msg'.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>vbell_msg</b> [<i>message</i>]</p>
<p class="Pp">Sets the visual bell message. <i>message</i> is printed to the
    status line if the window receives a bell character (^G), vbell is set to
    &quot;on&quot;, but the terminal does not support a visual bell. The default
    message is &quot;Wuff, Wuff!!&quot;. Without parameter, the current message
    is shown.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>vbellwait </b><i>sec</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Define a delay in seconds after each display of <i>screen</i>'s
    visual bell message. The default is 1 second.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>verbose</b> [<b>on</b>|<b>off</b>]</p>
<p class="Pp">If verbose is switched on, the command name is echoed, whenever a
    window is created (or resurrected from zombie state). Default is off.
    Without parameter, the current setting is shown.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>version</b></p>
<p class="Pp">Print the current version and the compile date in the status
  line.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>wall </b><i>message</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Write a message to all displays. The message will appear in the
    terminal's status line.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>width</b> [<b>-w</b>|<b>-d</b>] [<i>cols</i>
  [<i>lines</i>]]</p>
<p class="Pp">Toggle the window width between 80 and 132 columns or set it to
    <i>cols</i> columns if an argument is specified. This requires a capable
    terminal and the termcap entries &quot;Z0&quot; and &quot;Z1&quot;. See the
    &quot;termcap&quot; command for more information. You can also specify a new
    height if you want to change both values. The <b>-w</b> option tells screen
    to leave the display size unchanged and just set the window size, <b>-d</b>
    vice versa.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>windowlist</b> [<b>-b</b>] [<b>-m</b>]
  <br/>
  <b>windowlist</b> <b>string</b> [<i>string</i>]
  <br/>
  <b>windowlist</b> <b>title</b> [<i>title</i>]</p>
<p class="Pp">Display all windows in a table for visual window selection. The
    desired window can be selected via the standard movement keys (see the
    &quot;copy&quot; command) and activated via the return key. If the <b>-b</b>
    option is given, screen will switch to the blank window before presenting
    the list, so that the current window is also selectable. The <b>-m</b>
    option changes the order of the windows, instead of sorting by window
    numbers screen uses its internal most-recently-used list.</p>
<p class="Pp">The table format can be changed with the <b>string</b> and
    <b>title</b> option, the title is displayed as table heading, while the
    lines are made by using the string setting. The default setting is &quot;Num
    Name%=Flags&quot; for the title and &quot;%3n %t%=%f&quot; for the lines.
    See the &quot;STRING ESCAPES&quot; chapter for more codes (e.g. color
    settings).</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>windows</b></p>
<p class="Pp">Uses the message line to display a list of all the windows. Each
    window is listed by number with the name of process that has been started in
    the window (or its title); the current window is marked with a `*'; the
    previous window is marked with a `-'; all the windows that are &quot;logged
    in&quot; are marked with a `$'; a background window that has received a bell
    is marked with a `!'; a background window that is being monitored and has
    had activity occur is marked with an `@'; a window which has output logging
    turned on is marked with `(L)'; windows occupied by other users are marked
    with `&amp;'; windows in the zombie state are marked with `Z'. If this list
    is too long to fit on the terminal's status line only the portion around the
    current window is displayed.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>wrap </b>[<b>on</b>|<b>off</b>]</p>
<p class="Pp">Sets the line-wrap setting for the current window. When line-wrap
    is on, the second consecutive printable character output at the last column
    of a line will wrap to the start of the following line. As an added feature,
    backspace (^H) will also wrap through the left margin to the previous line.
    Default is `on'.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>writebuf</b> [<b>-e</b> <i>encoding</i>] [<i>filename</i>]</p>
<p class="Pp">Writes the contents of the paste buffer to the specified file, or
    the public accessible screen-exchange file if no filename is given. This is
    thought of as a primitive means of communication between <i>screen</i> users
    on the same host. If an encoding is specified the paste buffer is recoded on
    the fly to match the encoding. The filename can be set with the
    <i>bufferfile</i> command and defaults to
  &quot;/tmp/screen-exchange&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>writelock </b>[<b>on</b>|<b>off|<b>auto</b>]</b></p>
<p class="Pp">In addition to access control lists, not all users may be able to
    write to the same window at once. Per default, writelock is in `auto' mode
    and grants exclusive input permission to the user who is the first to switch
    to the particular window. When he leaves the window, other users may obtain
    the writelock (automatically). The writelock of the current window is
    disabled by the command &quot;writelock off&quot;. If the user issues the
    command &quot;writelock on&quot; he keeps the exclusive write permission
    while switching to other windows.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>xoff</b>
  <br/>
  <b>xon</b></p>
<p class="Pp">Insert a CTRL-s / CTRL-q character to the stdin queue of the
    current window.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>zmodem</b> [<b>off|auto|catch|pass</b>]
  <br/>
  <b>zmodem sendcmd</b> [<i>string</i>]
  <br/>
  <b>zmodem recvcmd</b> [<i>string</i>]</p>
<p class="Pp">Define zmodem support for screen. Screen understands two different
    modes when it detects a zmodem request: &quot;pass&quot; and
    &quot;catch&quot;. If the mode is set to &quot;pass&quot;, screen will relay
    all data to the attacher until the end of the transmission is reached. In
    &quot;catch&quot; mode screen acts as a zmodem endpoint and starts the
    corresponding rz/sz commands. If the mode is set to &quot;auto&quot;, screen
    will use &quot;catch&quot; if the window is a tty (e.g. a serial line),
    otherwise it will use &quot;pass&quot;.
  <br/>
  You can define the templates screen uses in &quot;catch&quot; mode via the
    second and the third form.
  <br/>
  Note also that this is an experimental feature.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>zombie </b>[<i>keys</i>]
  <br/>
  <b>defzombie </b>[<i>keys</i>]</p>
<p class="Pp">Per default <i>screen</i> windows are removed from the window list
    as soon as the windows process (e.g. shell) exits. When a string of two keys
    is specified to the zombie command, `dead' windows will remain in the list.
    The <b>kill</b> command may be used to remove such a window. Pressing the
    first key in the dead window has the same effect. When pressing the second
    key, <i>screen</i> will attempt to resurrect the window. The process that
    was initially running in the window will be launched again. Calling
    <b>zombie</b> without parameters will clear the zombie setting, thus making
    windows disappear when their process exits.</p>
<p class="Pp">As the zombie-setting is manipulated globally for all windows,
    this command should only be called <b>defzombie</b>. Until we need this as a
    per window setting, the commands <b>zombie</b> and <b>defzombie</b> are
    synonymous.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="THE_MESSAGE_LINE"><a class="permalink" href="#THE_MESSAGE_LINE">THE
  MESSAGE LINE</a></h1>
<i>Screen</i> displays informational messages and other diagnostics in a
  <i>message line</i>. While this line is distributed to appear at the bottom of
  the screen, it can be defined to appear at the top of the screen during
  compilation. If your terminal has a status line defined in its termcap,
  <i>screen</i> will use this for displaying its messages, otherwise a line of
  the current screen will be temporarily overwritten and output will be
  momentarily interrupted. The message line is automatically removed after a few
  seconds delay, but it can also be removed early (on terminals without a status
  line) by beginning to type.
<p class="Pp">The message line facility can be used by an application running in
    the current window by means of the ANSI <i>Privacy message</i> control
    sequence. For instance, from within the shell, try something like:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>echo '&lt;esc&gt;^Hello world from window '$WINDOW'&lt;esc&gt;\\'</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">where '&lt;esc&gt;' is an <i>escape</i>, '^' is a literal
    up-arrow, and '\\' turns into a single backslash.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="WINDOW_TYPES"><a class="permalink" href="#WINDOW_TYPES">WINDOW
  TYPES</a></h1>
Screen provides three different window types. New windows are created with
  <i>screen</i>'s <b>screen</b> command (see also the entry in chapter
  &quot;CUSTOMIZATION&quot;). The first parameter to the <b>screen</b> command
  defines which type of window is created. The different window types are all
  special cases of the normal type. They have been added in order to allow
  <i>screen</i> to be used efficiently as a console multiplexer with 100 or more
  windows.
<p class="Pp"></p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>The normal window contains a shell (default, if no parameter is given) or
      any other system command that could be executed from a shell (e.g.
      <b>slogin</b>, etc...)
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </li>
  <li>If a tty (character special device) name (e.g. &quot;/dev/ttya&quot;) is
      specified as the first parameter, then the window is directly connected to
      this device. This window type is similar to &quot;screen cu -l
      /dev/ttya&quot;. Read and write access is required on the device node, an
      exclusive open is attempted on the node to mark the connection line as
      busy. An optional parameter is allowed consisting of a comma separated
      list of flags in the notation used by stty(1):</li>
</ul>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>&lt;baud_rate&gt;		</dt>
  <dd>Usually 300, 1200, 9600 or 19200. This affects transmission as well as
      receive speed.</dd>
  <dt>cs8 or cs7</dt>
  <dd>Specify the transmission of eight (or seven) bits per byte.</dd>
  <dt>ixon or -ixon</dt>
  <dd>Enables (or disables) software flow-control (CTRL-S/CTRL-Q) for sending
      data.</dd>
  <dt>ixoff or -ixon</dt>
  <dd>Enables (or disables) software flow-control for receiving data.</dd>
  <dt>istrip or -istrip</dt>
  <dd>Clear (or keep) the eight bit in each received byte.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">You may want to specify as many of these options as applicable.
    Unspecified options cause the terminal driver to make up the parameter
    values of the connection. These values are system dependant and may be in
    defaults or values saved from a previous connection.</p>
<p class="Pp">For tty windows, the <b>info</b> command shows some of the modem
    control lines in the status line. These may include `RTS', `CTS', 'DTR',
    `DSR', `CD' and more. This depends on the available ioctl()'s and system
    header files as well as the on the physical capabilities of the serial
    board. Signals that are logical low (inactive) have their name preceded by
    an exclamation mark (!), otherwise the signal is logical high (active).
    Signals not supported by the hardware but available to the ioctl() interface
    are usually shown low.
  <br/>
  When the CLOCAL status bit is true, the whole set of modem signals is placed
    inside curly braces ({ and }). When the CRTSCTS or TIOCSOFTCAR bit is set,
    the signals `CTS' or `CD' are shown in parenthesis, respectively.</p>

<p class="Pp">For tty windows, the command <b>break</b> causes the Data

  ESCAPES</a></h1>
Screen provides an escape mechanism to insert information like the current time
  into messages or file names. The escape character is '%' with one exception:
  inside of a window's hardstatus '^%' ('^E') is used instead.
<p class="Pp">Here is the full list of supported escapes:</p>

  <dd>pad the string to the display's width (like TeX's hfill). If a number is

      tells screen to treat the number as absolute position. You can specify to
      pad relative to the last absolute pad position by adding a '+' qualifier
      or to pad relative to the right margin by using '-'. The padding truncates
      the string if the specified position lies before the current position. Add
      the 'L' qualifier to change this.</dd>

  <dt>&gt;</dt>
  <dd>mark the current text position for the next truncation. When screen needs
      to do truncation, it tries to do it in a way that the marked position gets
      moved to the specified percentage of the output area. (The area starts
      from the last absolute pad position and ends with the position specified
      by the truncation operator.) The 'L' qualifier tells screen to mark the
      truncated parts with '...'.</dd>
  <dt>{</dt>
  <dd>attribute/color modifier string terminated by the next &quot;}&quot;</dd>
  <dt>`</dt>
  <dd>Substitute with the output of a 'backtick' command. The length qualifier
      is misused to identify one of the commands.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The 'c' and 'C' escape may be qualified with a '0' to make
    <i>screen</i> use zero instead of space as fill character. The '0' qualifier
    also makes the '=' escape use absolute positions. The 'n' and '=' escapes
    understand a length qualifier (e.g. '%3n'), 'D' and 'M' can be prefixed with
    'L' to generate long names, 'w' and 'W' also show the window flags if 'L' is
    given.</p>
<p class="Pp">An attribute/color modifier is is used to change the attributes or
    the color settings. Its format is &quot;[attribute modifier] [color
    description]&quot;. The attribute modifier must be prefixed by a change type
    indicator if it can be confused with a color desciption. The following
    change types are known:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>+</dt>
  <dd>add the specified set to the current attributes</dd>
  <dt>-</dt>
  <dd>remove the set from the current attributes</dd>
  <dt>!</dt>
  <dd>invert the set in the current attributes</dd>
  <dt>=</dt>
  <dd>change the current attributes to the specified set</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The attribute set can either be specified as a hexadecimal number
    or a combination of the following letters:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">

<p class="Pp">Colors are coded either as a hexadecimal number or two letters
    specifying the desired background and foreground color (in that order). The

  <dd>white</dd>
  <dt>d</dt>
  <dd>default color</dd>
  <dt>.</dt>
  <dd>leave color unchanged</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The capitalized versions of the letter specify bright colors. You
    can also use the pseudo-color 'i' to set just the brightness and leave the
    color unchanged.
  <br/>
  A one digit/letter color description is treated as foreground or background
    color dependant on the current attributes: if reverse mode is set, the
    background color is changed instead of the foreground color. If you don't
    like this, prefix the color with a &quot;.&quot;. If you want the same
    behaviour for two-letter color descriptions, also prefix them with a
    &quot;.&quot;.
  <br/>
  As a special case, &quot;%{-}&quot; restores the attributes and colors that
    were set before the last change was made (i.e. pops one level of the

<h1 class="Sh" id="FLOW-CONTROL"><a class="permalink" href="#FLOW-CONTROL">FLOW-CONTROL</a></h1>
Each window has a flow-control setting that determines how <i>screen</i> deals
  with the XON and XOFF characters (and perhaps the interrupt character). When
  flow-control is turned off, <i>screen</i> ignores the XON and XOFF characters,
  which allows the user to send them to the current program by simply typing
  them (useful for the <i>emacs</i> editor, for instance). The trade-off is that
  it will take longer for output from a &quot;normal&quot; program to pause in
  response to an XOFF. With flow-control turned on, XON and XOFF characters are
  used to immediately pause the output of the current window. You can still send
  these characters to the current program, but you must use the appropriate
  two-character <i>screen</i> commands (typically &quot;C-a q&quot; (xon) and
  &quot;C-a s&quot; (xoff)). The xon/xoff commands are also useful for typing
  C-s and C-q past a terminal that intercepts these characters.
<p class="Pp">Each window has an initial flow-control value set with either the
    <b>-f</b> option or the &quot;defflow&quot; .screenrc command. Per default
    the windows are set to automatic flow-switching. It can then be toggled
    between the three states 'fixed on', 'fixed off' and 'automatic'
    interactively with the &quot;flow&quot; command bound to &quot;C-a
  f&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">The automatic flow-switching mode deals with flow control using
    the TIOCPKT mode (like &quot;rlogin&quot; does). If the tty driver does not
    support TIOCPKT, <i>screen</i> tries to find out the right mode based on the
    current setting of the application keypad - when it is enabled, flow-control
    is turned off and visa versa. Of course, you can still manipulate
    flow-control manually when needed.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you're running with flow-control enabled and find that pressing
    the interrupt key (usually C-c) does not interrupt the display until another
    6-8 lines have scrolled by, try running <i>screen</i> with the
    &quot;interrupt&quot; option (add the &quot;interrupt&quot; flag to the
    &quot;flow&quot; command in your .screenrc, or use the <b>-i</b>
    command-line option). This causes the output that <i>screen</i> has
    accumulated from the interrupted program to be flushed. One disadvantage is
    that the virtual terminal's memory contains the non-flushed version of the
    output, which in rare cases can cause minor inaccuracies in the output. For
    example, if you switch screens and return, or update the screen with
    &quot;C-a l&quot; you would see the version of the output you would have
    gotten without &quot;interrupt&quot; being on. Also, you might need to turn
    off flow-control (or use auto-flow mode to turn it off automatically) when
    running a program that expects you to type the interrupt character as input,
    as it is possible to interrupt the output of the virtual terminal to your
    physical terminal when flow-control is enabled. If this happens, a simple
    refresh of the screen with &quot;C-a l&quot; will restore it. Give each mode
    a try, and use whichever mode you find more comfortable.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="TITLES_(naming_windows)"><a class="permalink" href="#TITLES_(naming_windows)">TITLES
  (naming windows)</a></h1>
You can customize each window's name in the window display (viewed with the
  &quot;windows&quot; command (C-a w)) by setting it with one of the title
  commands. Normally the name displayed is the actual command name of the
  program created in the window. However, it is sometimes useful to distinguish
  various programs of the same name or to change the name on-the-fly to reflect
  the current state of the window.
<p class="Pp">The default name for all shell windows can be set with the
    &quot;shelltitle&quot; command in the .screenrc file, while all other
    windows are created with a &quot;screen&quot; command and thus can have
    their name set with the <b>-t</b> option. Interactively, there is the
    title-string escape-sequence (&lt;esc&gt;k<i>name</i>&lt;esc&gt;\) and the
    &quot;title&quot; command (C-a A). The former can be output from an
    application to control the window's name under software control, and the
    latter will prompt for a name when typed. You can also bind pre-defined
    names to keys with the &quot;title&quot; command to set things quickly
    without prompting.</p>
<p class="Pp">Finally, <i>screen</i> has a shell-specific heuristic that is
    enabled by setting the window's name to &quot;<i>search|name</i>&quot; and
    arranging to have a null title escape-sequence output as a part of your
    prompt. The <i>search</i> portion specifies an end-of-prompt search string,
    while the <i>name</i> portion specifies the default shell name for the
    window. If the <i>name</i> ends in a `:' <i>screen</i> will add what it
    believes to be the current command running in the window to the end of the
    window's shell name (e.g. &quot;<i>name:cmd</i>&quot;). Otherwise the
    current command name supersedes the shell name while it is running.</p>
<p class="Pp">Here's how it works: you must modify your shell prompt to output a
    null title-escape-sequence (&lt;esc&gt;k&lt;esc&gt;\) as a part of your
    prompt. The last part of your prompt must be the same as the string you
    specified for the <i>search</i> portion of the title. Once this is set up,
    <i>screen</i> will use the title-escape-sequence to clear the previous
    command name and get ready for the next command. Then, when a newline is
    received from the shell, a search is made for the end of the prompt. If
    found, it will grab the first word after the matched string and use it as
    the command name. If the command name begins with either '!', '%', or '^'
    <i>screen</i> will use the first word on the following line (if found) in
    preference to the just-found name. This helps csh users get better command
    names when using job control or history recall commands.</p>
<p class="Pp">Here's some .screenrc examples:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>screen -t top 2 nice top</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Adding this line to your .screenrc would start a nice-d version of
    the &quot;top&quot; command in window 2 named &quot;top&quot; rather than
    &quot;nice&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
	shelltitle '&gt; |csh'
	screen 1
</pre>
<p class="Pp">These commands would start a shell with the given shelltitle. The
    title specified is an auto-title that would expect the prompt and the typed
    command to look something like the following:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>/usr/joe/src/dir&gt; trn</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">(it looks after the '&gt; ' for the command name). The window
    status would show the name &quot;trn&quot; while the command was running,
    and revert to &quot;csh&quot; upon completion.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>bind R screen -t '% |root:' su</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Having this command in your .screenrc would bind the key sequence
    &quot;C-a R&quot; to the &quot;su&quot; command and give it an auto-title
    name of &quot;root:&quot;. For this auto-title to work, the screen could
    look something like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
	% !em
	emacs file.c
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Here the user typed the csh history command &quot;!em&quot; which
    ran the previously entered &quot;emacs&quot; command. The window status
    would show &quot;root:emacs&quot; during the execution of the command, and
    revert to simply &quot;root:&quot; at its completion.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
	bind o title
	bind E title &quot;&quot;
	bind u title (unknown)
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The first binding doesn't have any arguments, so it would prompt
    you for a title. when you type &quot;C-a o&quot;. The second binding would
    clear an auto-title's current setting (C-a E). The third binding would set
    the current window's title to &quot;(unknown)&quot; (C-a u).</p>
<p class="Pp">One thing to keep in mind when adding a null title-escape-sequence
    to your prompt is that some shells (like the csh) count all the non-control
    characters as part of the prompt's length. If these invisible characters
    aren't a multiple of 8 then backspacing over a tab will result in an
    incorrect display. One way to get around this is to use a prompt like
  this:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>set prompt='^[[0000m^[k^[\% '</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The escape-sequence &quot;&lt;esc&gt;[0000m&quot; not only
    normalizes the character attributes, but all the zeros round the length of
    the invisible characters up to 8. Bash users will probably want to echo the
    escape sequence in the PROMPT_COMMAND:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>PROMPT_COMMAND='echo -n -e &quot;\033k\033\134&quot;'</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">(I used &quot;134&quot; to output a `\' because of a bug in bash
    v1.04).</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="THE_VIRTUAL_TERMINAL"><a class="permalink" href="#THE_VIRTUAL_TERMINAL">THE
  VIRTUAL TERMINAL</a></h1>
Each window in a <i>screen</i> session emulates a VT100 terminal, with some
  extra functions added. The VT100 emulator is hard-coded, no other terminal
  types can be emulated.
<br/>
Usually <i>screen</i> tries to emulate as much of the VT100/ANSI standard as
  possible. But if your terminal lacks certain capabilities, the emulation may
  not be complete. In these cases <i>screen</i> has to tell the applications
  that some of the features are missing. This is no problem on machines using
  termcap, because <i>screen</i> can use the $TERMCAP variable to customize the
  standard <i>screen</i> termcap.
<p class="Pp">But if you do a rlogin on another machine or your machine supports
    only terminfo this method fails. Because of this, <i>screen</i> offers a way
    to deal with these cases. Here is how it works:</p>
<p class="Pp">When <i>screen</i> tries to figure out a terminal name for itself,
    it first looks for an entry named &quot;screen.&lt;term&gt;&quot;, where
    &lt;term&gt; is the contents of your $TERM variable. If no such entry
    exists, <i>screen</i> tries &quot;screen&quot; (or &quot;screen-w&quot; if
    the terminal is wide (132 cols or more)). If even this entry cannot be
    found, &quot;vt100&quot; is used as a substitute.</p>
<p class="Pp">The idea is that if you have a terminal which doesn't support an
    important feature (e.g. delete char or clear to EOS) you can build a new
    termcap/terminfo entry for <i>screen</i> (named
    &quot;screen.&lt;dumbterm&gt;&quot;) in which this capability has been
    disabled. If this entry is installed on your machines you are able to do a
    rlogin and still keep the correct termcap/terminfo entry. The terminal name
    is put in the $TERM variable of all new windows. <i>Screen</i> also sets the
    $TERMCAP variable reflecting the capabilities of the virtual terminal
    emulated. Notice that, however, on machines using the terminfo database this
    variable has no effect. Furthermore, the variable $WINDOW is set to the
    window number of each window.</p>
<p class="Pp">The actual set of capabilities supported by the virtual terminal
    depends on the capabilities supported by the physical terminal. If, for
    instance, the physical terminal does not support underscore mode,
    <i>screen</i> does not put the `us' and `ue' capabilities into the window's
    $TERMCAP variable, accordingly. However, a minimum number of capabilities
    must be supported by a terminal in order to run <i>screen</i>; namely
    scrolling, clear screen, and direct cursor addressing (in addition,
    <i>screen</i> does not run on hardcopy terminals or on terminals that
    over-strike).</p>
<p class="Pp">Also, you can customize the $TERMCAP value used by <i>screen</i>
    by using the &quot;termcap&quot; .screenrc command, or by defining the
    variable $SCREENCAP prior to startup. When the is latter defined, its value
    will be copied verbatim into each window's $TERMCAP variable. This can
    either be the full terminal definition, or a filename where the terminal
    &quot;screen&quot; (and/or &quot;screen-w&quot;) is defined.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that <i>screen</i> honors the &quot;terminfo&quot; .screenrc
    command if the system uses the terminfo database rather than termcap.</p>
<p class="Pp">When the boolean `G0' capability is present in the termcap entry
    for the terminal on which <i>screen</i> has been called, the terminal
    emulation of <i>screen</i> supports multiple character sets. This allows an
    application to make use of, for instance, the VT100 graphics character set
    or national character sets. The following control functions from ISO 2022
    are supported: <i>lock shift G0</i> (<i>SI</i>), <i>lock shift G1</i>
    (<i>SO</i>), <i>lock shift G2</i>, <i>lock shift G3</i>, <i>single shift
    G2</i>, and <i>single shift G3</i>. When a virtual terminal is created or
    reset, the ASCII character set is designated as <i>G0</i> through <i>G3</i>.
    When the `G0' capability is present, <i>screen</i> evaluates the
    capabilities `S0', `E0', and `C0' if present. `S0' is the sequence the
    terminal uses to enable and start the graphics character set rather than
    <i>SI</i>. `E0' is the corresponding replacement for <i>SO</i>. `C0' gives a
    character by character translation string that is used during semi-graphics
    mode. This string is built like the `acsc' terminfo capability.</p>
<p class="Pp">When the `po' and `pf' capabilities are present in the terminal's
    termcap entry, applications running in a <i>screen</i> window can send
    output to the printer port of the terminal. This allows a user to have an
    application in one window sending output to a printer connected to the
    terminal, while all other windows are still active (the printer port is
    enabled and disabled again for each chunk of output). As a side-effect,
    programs running in different windows can send output to the printer
    simultaneously. Data sent to the printer is not displayed in the window. The
    <i>info</i> command displays a line starting `PRIN' while the printer is
    active.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Screen</i> maintains a hardstatus line for every window. If a
    window gets selected, the display's hardstatus will be updated to match the
    window's hardstatus line. If the display has no hardstatus the line will be
    displayed as a standard <i>screen</i> message. The hardstatus line can be
    changed with the ANSI Application Program Command (APC):
    &quot;ESC_&lt;string&gt;ESC\&quot;. As a convenience for xterm users the
    sequence &quot;ESC]0..2;&lt;string&gt;^G&quot; is also accepted.</p>
<p class="Pp">Some capabilities are only put into the $TERMCAP variable of the
    virtual terminal if they can be efficiently implemented by the physical
    terminal. For instance, `dl' (delete line) is only put into the $TERMCAP
    variable if the terminal supports either delete line itself or scrolling
    regions. Note that this may provoke confusion, when the session is
    reattached on a different terminal, as the value of $TERMCAP cannot be
    modified by parent processes.</p>
<p class="Pp">The &quot;alternate screen&quot; capability is not enabled by
    default. Set the <b>altscreen</b> .screenrc command to enable it.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="INPUT_TRANSLATION"><a class="permalink" href="#INPUT_TRANSLATION">INPUT
  TRANSLATION</a></h1>
In order to do a full VT100 emulation <i>screen</i> has to detect that a
  sequence of characters in the input stream was generated by a keypress on the
  user's keyboard and insert the VT100 style escape sequence. <i>Screen</i> has
  a very flexible way of doing this by making it possible to map arbitrary
  commands on arbitrary sequences of characters. For standard VT100 emulation
  the command will always insert a string in the input buffer of the window (see
  also command <b>stuff</b> in the command table). Because the sequences
  generated by a keypress can change after a reattach from a different terminal
  type, it is possible to bind commands to the termcap name of the keys.
  <i>Screen</i> will insert the correct binding after each reattach. See the
  <b>bindkey</b> command for further details on the syntax and examples.
<p class="Pp">Here is the table of the default key bindings. (A) means that the
    command is executed if the keyboard is switched into application mode.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="CHARACTER_TRANSLATION"><a class="permalink" href="#CHARACTER_TRANSLATION">CHARACTER
  TRANSLATION</a></h1>
<i>Screen</i> has a powerful mechanism to translate characters to arbitrary
  strings depending on the current font and terminal type. Use this feature if
  you want to work with a common standard character set (say ISO8851-latin1)
  even on terminals that scatter the more unusual characters over several
  national language font pages.
<p class="Pp">Syntax:</p>
<pre>
    <b>XC=</b><i>&lt;charset-mapping&gt;</i>{<b>,,</b><i>&lt;charset-mapping&gt;</i>}
    <i>&lt;charset-mapping&gt;</i> := <i>&lt;designator&gt;&lt;template&gt;</i>{<b>,</b><i>&lt;mapping&gt;</i>}
    <i>&lt;mapping&gt;</i> := <i>&lt;char-to-be-mapped&gt;&lt;template-arg&gt;</i>
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The things in braces may be repeated any number of times.</p>
<p class="Pp">A <i>&lt;charset-mapping&gt;</i> tells <i>screen</i> how to map
    characters in font <i>&lt;designator&gt;</i> ('B': Ascii, 'A': UK, 'K':
    german, etc.) to strings. Every <i>&lt;mapping&gt;</i> describes to what
    string a single character will be translated. A template mechanism is used,
    as most of the time the codes have a lot in common (for example strings to
    switch to and from another charset). Each occurrence of '%' in
    <i>&lt;template&gt;</i> gets substituted with the
    <i>&lt;template-arg&gt;</i> specified together with the character. If your
    strings are not similar at all, then use '%' as a template and place the
    full string in <i>&lt;template-arg&gt;</i>. A quoting mechanism was added to
    make it possible to use a real '%'. The '\' character quotes the special
    characters '\', '%', and ','.</p>
<p class="Pp">Here is an example:</p>
<p class="Pp">
   termcap hp700 'XC=B\E(K%\E(B,\304[,\326\\\\,\334]'</p>
<p class="Pp">This tells <i>screen</i> how to translate ISOlatin1 (charset 'B')
    upper case umlaut characters on a hp700 terminal that has a german charset.
    '\304' gets translated to '\E(K[\E(B' and so on. Note that this line gets
    parsed *three* times before the internal lookup table is built, therefore a
    lot of quoting is needed to create a single '\'.</p>
<p class="Pp">Another extension was added to allow more emulation: If a mapping
    translates the unquoted '%' char, it will be sent to the terminal whenever
    <i>screen</i> switches to the corresponding <i>&lt;designator&gt;</i>. In
    this special case the template is assumed to be just '%' because the charset
    switch sequence and the character mappings normally haven't much in
  common.</p>
<p class="Pp">This example shows one use of the extension:</p>
<p class="Pp">
   termcap xterm 'XC=K%,%\E(B,[\304,\\\\\326,]\334'</p>
<p class="Pp">Here, a part of the german ('K') charset is emulated on an xterm.
    If <i>screen</i> has to change to the 'K' charset, '\E(B' will be sent to
    the terminal, i.e. the ASCII charset is used instead. The template is just
    '%', so the mapping is straightforward: '[' to '\304', '\' to '\326', and
    ']' to '\334'.</p>

<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>`dm' (delete mode) and `xs' are not handled correctly (they are ignored).
      `xn' is treated as a magic-margin indicator.</li>
  <li><i>Screen</i> has no clue about double-high or double-wide characters. But
      this is the only area where <i>vttest</i> is allowed to fail.</li>
  <li>It is not possible to change the environment variable $TERMCAP when
      reattaching under a different terminal type.</li>
  <li>The support of terminfo based systems is very limited. Adding extra
      capabilities to $TERMCAP may not have any effects.</li>
  <li><i>Screen</i> does not make use of hardware tabs.</li>
  <li><i>Screen</i> must be installed as set-uid with owner root on most systems
      in order to be able to correctly change the owner of the tty device file
      for each window. Special permission may also be required to write the file
      &quot;/etc/utmp&quot;.</li>
  <li>Entries in &quot;/etc/utmp&quot; are not removed when <i>screen</i> is
      killed with SIGKILL. This will cause some programs (like &quot;w&quot; or
      &quot;rwho&quot;) to advertise that a user is logged on who really
    isn't.</li>
  <li><i>Screen</i> may give a strange warning when your tty has no utmp
    entry.</li>
  <li>When the modem line was hung up, <i>screen</i> may not automatically
      detach (or quit) unless the device driver is configured to send a HANGUP
      signal. To detach a <i>screen</i> session use the -D or -d command line
      option.</li>
  <li>If a password is set, the command line options -d and -D still detach a
      session without asking.</li>
  <li>Both &quot;breaktype&quot; and &quot;defbreaktype&quot; change the break
      generating method used by all terminal devices. The first should change a
      window specific setting, where the latter should change only the default
      for new windows.</li>
  <li>When attaching to a multiuser session, the user's .screenrc file is not
      sourced. Each user's personal settings have to be included in the
      .screenrc file from which the session is booted, or have to be changed
      manually.</li>
  <li>A weird imagination is most useful to gain full advantage of all the
      features.</li>
  <li>Send bug-reports, fixes, enhancements, t-shirts, money, beer &amp; pizza
      to <b>screen@uni-erlangen.de</b>.
