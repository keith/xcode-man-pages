<p class="Pp">pcap-tstamp - packet time stamps in libpcap</p>
</section>

<p class="Pp">When capturing traffic, each packet is given a time stamp
    representing, for incoming packets, the arrival time of the packet and, for
    outgoing packets, the transmission time of the packet. This time is an
    approximation of the arrival or transmission time. If it is supplied by the
    operating system running on the host on which the capture is being done,
    there are several reasons why it might not precisely represent the arrival
    or transmission time:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>if the time stamp is applied to the packet when the networking stack
      receives the packet, the networking stack might not see the packet until
      an interrupt is delivered for the packet or a timer event causes the
      networking device driver to poll for packets, and the time stamp might not
      be applied until the packet has had some processing done by other code in
      the networking stack, so there might be a significant delay between the
      time when the last bit of the packet is received by the capture device and
      when the networking stack time-stamps the packet;</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>the timer used to generate the time stamps might have low resolution, for
      example, it might be a timer updated once per host operating system timer
      tick, with the host operating system timer ticking once every few
      milliseconds;</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>a high-resolution timer might use a counter that runs at a rate dependent
      on the processor clock speed, and that clock speed might be adjusted
      upwards or downwards over time and the timer might not be able to
      compensate for all those adjustments;</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>the host operating system's clock might be adjusted over time to match a
      time standard to which the host is being synchronized, which might be done
      by temporarily slowing down or speeding up the clock or by making a single
      adjustment;</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>different CPU cores on a multi-core or multi-processor system might be
      running at different speeds, or might not have time counters all
      synchronized, so packets time-stamped by different cores might not have
      consistent time stamps;</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>some time sources, such as those that supply POSIX &quot;seconds since the
      Epoch&quot; time, do not count leap seconds, meaning that the seconds
      portion (<b>tv_sec</b>) of the time stamp might not be incremented for a
      leap second, so that the fraction-of-a-second part of the time stamp might
      roll over past zero but the second part would not change, or the clock
      might run slightly more slowly for a period before the leap second.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">For these reasons, time differences between packet time stamps
    will not necessarily accurately reflect the time differences between the
    receipt or transmission times of the packets.</p>
<p class="Pp">In addition, packets time-stamped by different cores might be
    time-stamped in one order and added to the queue of packets for libpcap to
    read in another order, so time stamps might not be monotonically
  increasing.</p>
<p class="Pp">Some capture devices on some platforms can provide time stamps for
    packets; those time stamps are usually high-resolution time stamps, and are
    usually applied to the packet when the first or last bit of the packet
    arrives, and are thus more accurate than time stamps provided by the host
    operating system. Those time stamps might not, however, be synchronized with
    the host operating system's clock, so that, for example, the time stamp of a
    packet might not correspond to the time stamp of an event on the host
    triggered by the arrival of that packet. If they are synchronized with the
    host operating system's clock, some of the issues listed above with time
    stamps supplied by the host operating system may also apply to time stamps
    supplied by the capture device.</p>
<p class="Pp">Depending on the capture device and the software on the host,
    libpcap might allow different types of time stamp to be used. The
    <b>pcap_list_tstamp_types</b>(3PCAP) routine provides, for a packet capture
    handle created by <b>pcap_create</b>(3PCAP) but not yet activated by
    <b>pcap_activate</b>(3PCAP), a list of time stamp types supported by the
    capture device for that handle. The list might be empty, in which case no
    choice of time stamp type is offered for that capture device. If the list is
    not empty, the <b>pcap_set_tstamp_type</b>(3PCAP) routine can be used after
    a <b>pcap_create</b>() call and before a <b>pcap_activate</b>() call to
    specify the type of time stamp to be used on the device. The time stamp
    types are listed here; the first value is the #define to use in code, the
    second value is the value returned by
    <b>pcap_tstamp_type_val_to_name</b>(3PCAP) and accepted by
    <b>pcap_tstamp_type_name_to_val</b>(3PCAP)<b>.</b></p>

      done. This is a high-precision time stamp; it is not synchronized with the

</dl>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Time stamps synchronized with the system clock can go backwards,
    as the system clock can go backwards. If a clock is not in sync with the
    system clock, that could be because the system clock isn't keeping accurate
    time, because the other clock isn't keeping accurate time, or both.</p>
<p class="Pp">Host-provided time stamps generally correspond to the time when
    the time-stamping code sees the packet; this could be some unknown amount of
    time after the first or last bit of the packet is received by the network
    adapter, due to batching of interrupts for packet arrival, queueing delays,
    etc..</p>
<p class="Pp">By default, when performing a live capture or reading from a
    savefile, time stamps are supplied as seconds since January 1, 1970,
    00:00:00 UTC, and microseconds since that seconds value, even if
    higher-resolution time stamps are available from the capture device or in
    the savefile. If, when reading a savefile, the time stamps in the file have
    a higher resolution than one microsecond, the additional digits of
    resolution are discarded.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>pcap_set_tstamp_precision</b>(3PCAP) routine can be used
    after a <b>pcap_create</b>() call and after a <b>pcap_activate</b>() call to
    specify the resolution of the time stamps to get for the device. If the
    hardware or software cannot supply a higher-resolution time stamp, the
    <b>pcap_set_tstamp_precision</b>() call will fail, and the time stamps
    supplied after the <b>pcap_activate</b>() call will have microsecond
    resolution.</p>
<p class="Pp">When opening a savefile, the
    <b>pcap_open_offline_with_tstamp_precision</b>(3PCAP) and
    <b>pcap_fopen_offline_with_tstamp_precision</b>(3PCAP) routines can be used
    to specify the resolution of time stamps to be read from the file; if the
    time stamps in the file have a lower resolution, the fraction-of-a-second
    portion of the time stamps will be scaled to the specified resolution.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>pcap_get_tstamp_precision</b>(3PCAP) routine returns the
    resolution of time stamps that will be supplied; when capturing packets,
    this does not reflect the actual precision of the time stamp supplied by the
    hardware or operating system and, when reading a savefile, this does not
    indicate the actual precision of time stamps in the file.</p>
