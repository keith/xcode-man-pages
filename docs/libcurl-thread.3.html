libcurl is thread safe but has no internal thread synchronization. You may have
  to provide your own locking should you meet any of the thread safety
  exceptions below.
<p class="Pp"><b>Handles.</b> You must <b>never</b> share the same handle in
    multiple threads. You can pass the handles around among threads, but you
    must never use a single handle from more than one thread at any given
  time.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Shared objects.</b> You can share certain data between multiple
    handles by using the share interface but you must provide your own locking
    and set <i>curl_share_setopt(3)</i> CURLSHOPT_LOCKFUNC and
    CURLSHOPT_UNLOCKFUNC.</p>

If you are accessing HTTPS or FTPS URLs in a multi-threaded manner, you are then
  of course using the underlying SSL library multi-threaded and those libs might
  have their own requirements on this issue. You may need to provide one or two
  functions to allow it to function properly:

  <dt>OpenSSL</dt>
  <dd>OpenSSL 1.1.0 &quot;can be safely used in multi-threaded applications
      provided that support for the underlying OS threading API is
      built-in.&quot;

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>Signals</dt>
  <dd>Signals are used for timing out name resolves (during DNS lookup) - when
      built without using either the c-ares or threaded resolver backends. When
      using multiple threads you should set the <i>CURLOPT_NOSIGNAL(3)</i>
      option to 1L for all handles. Everything will or might work fine except
      that timeouts are not honored during the DNS lookup - which you can work
      around by building libcurl with c-ares or threaded-resolver support.
      c-ares is a library that provides asynchronous name resolves. On some
      platforms, libcurl simply will not function properly multi-threaded unless
      the <i>CURLOPT_NOSIGNAL(3)</i> option is set.
    <p class="Pp">When <i>CURLOPT_NOSIGNAL(3)</i> is set to 1L, your application
        needs to deal with the risk of a SIGPIPE (that at least the OpenSSL
        backend can trigger). Note that setting <i>CURLOPT_NOSIGNAL(3)</i> to 0L
        will not work in a threaded situation as there will be race where
        libcurl risks restoring the former signal handler while another thread
        should still ignore it.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Name resolving</dt>
  <dd><b>gethostby* functions and other system calls.</b> These functions,
      provided by your operating system, must be thread safe. It is very
      important that libcurl can find and use thread safe versions of these and
      other system calls, as otherwise it can't function fully thread safe. Some
      operating systems are known to have faulty thread implementations. We have
      previously received problem reports on *BSD (at least in the past, they
      may be working fine these days). Some operating systems that are known to
      have solid and working thread support are Linux, Solaris and Windows.</dd>
  <dt>curl_global_* functions</dt>
  <dd>These functions are not thread safe. If you are using libcurl with
      multiple threads it is especially important that before use you call
      <i>curl_global_init(3)</i> or <i>curl_global_init_mem(3)</i> to explicitly
      initialize the library and its dependents, rather than rely on the
      &quot;lazy&quot; fail-safe initialization that takes place the first time
      <i>curl_easy_init(3)</i> is called. For an in-depth explanation refer to
      <i>libcurl(3)</i> section <b>GLOBAL CONSTANTS</b>.</dd>
  <dt>Memory functions</dt>
  <dd>These functions, provided either by your operating system or your own
      replacements, must be thread safe. You can use
      <i>curl_global_init_mem(3)</i> to set your own replacement memory
      functions.</dd>
  <dt>Non-safe functions</dt>
  <dd><i>CURLOPT_DNS_USE_GLOBAL_CACHE(3)</i> is not thread-safe.</dd>
