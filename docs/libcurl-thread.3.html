  <dd>Signals are used for timing out name resolves (during DNS lookup) - when
      built without using either the c-ares or threaded resolver backends. When
      using multiple threads you should set the <i>CURLOPT_NOSIGNAL(3)</i>
      option to 1L for all handles. Everything will or might work fine except
      that timeouts are not honored during the DNS lookup - which you can work
      around by building libcurl with c-ares or threaded-resolver support.
      c-ares is a library that provides asynchronous name resolves. On some
      platforms, libcurl simply will not function properly multi-threaded unless
      the <i>CURLOPT_NOSIGNAL(3)</i> option is set.
    <p class="Pp">When <i>CURLOPT_NOSIGNAL(3)</i> is set to 1L, your application
        needs to deal with the risk of a SIGPIPE (that at least the OpenSSL
        backend can trigger). Note that setting <i>CURLOPT_NOSIGNAL(3)</i> to 0L
        will not work in a threaded situation as there will be race where
        libcurl risks restoring the former signal handler while another thread
        should still ignore it.</p>

  <dd><b>gethostby* functions and other system calls.</b> These functions,
      provided by your operating system, must be thread safe. It is important
      that libcurl can find and use thread safe versions of these and other
      system calls, as otherwise it cannot function fully thread safe. Some
      operating systems are known to have faulty thread implementations. We have
      previously received problem reports on *BSD (at least in the past, they
      may be working fine these days). Some operating systems that are known to
      have solid and working thread support are Linux, Solaris and Windows.</dd>
  <dt id="curl_global_*"><a class="permalink" href="#curl_global_*">curl_global_*
    functions</a></dt>
  <dd>These functions are thread-safe since libcurl 7.84.0 if
      <i>curl_version_info(3)</i> has the <b>CURL_VERSION_THREADSAFE</b> feature
      bit set (most platforms).
    <p class="Pp">If these functions are not thread-safe and you are using
        libcurl with multiple threads it is especially important that before use
        you call <i>curl_global_init(3)</i> or <i>curl_global_init_mem(3)</i> to
        explicitly initialize the library and its dependents, rather than rely
        on the &quot;lazy&quot; fail-safe initialization that takes place the
        first time <i>curl_easy_init(3)</i> is called. For an in-depth
        explanation refer to <i>libcurl(3)</i> section <b>GLOBAL
      CONSTANTS</b>.</p>
