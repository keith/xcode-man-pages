<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="Multi-threading_with_libcurl"><a class="permalink" href="#Multi-threading_with_libcurl">Multi-threading
  with libcurl</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">libcurl is thread safe but has no internal thread synchronization.
    You may have to provide your own locking should you meet any of the thread
    safety exceptions below.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="Handles"><a class="permalink" href="#Handles">Handles</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">You must <b>never</b> share the same handle in multiple threads.
    You can pass the handles around among threads, but you must never use a
    single handle from more than one thread at any given time.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="Shared_objects"><a class="permalink" href="#Shared_objects">Shared
  objects</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">You can share certain data between multiple handles by using the
    share interface but you must provide your own locking and set
    <i>curl_share_setopt(3)</i> CURLSHOPT_LOCKFUNC and CURLSHOPT_UNLOCKFUNC.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that some items are specifically documented as not
    thread-safe in the share API (the connection pool and HSTS cache for
    example).</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="TLS"><a class="permalink" href="#TLS">TLS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">All current TLS libraries libcurl supports are thread-safe.
    OpenSSL 1.1.0+ can be safely used in multi-threaded applications provided
    that support for the underlying OS threading API is built-in. For older
    versions of OpenSSL, the user must set mutex callbacks.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="Signals"><a class="permalink" href="#Signals">Signals</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Signals are used for timing out name resolves (during DNS lookup)
    - when built without using either the c-ares or threaded resolver backends.
    On systems that have a signal concept.</p>
<p class="Pp">When using multiple threads you should set the
    <i>CURLOPT_NOSIGNAL(3)</i> option to 1L for all handles. Everything works
    fine except that timeouts cannot be honored during DNS lookups - which you
    can work around by building libcurl with c-ares or threaded-resolver
    support. c-ares is a library that provides asynchronous name resolves. On
    some platforms, libcurl simply cannot function properly multi-threaded
    unless the <i>CURLOPT_NOSIGNAL(3)</i> option is set.</p>
<p class="Pp">When <i>CURLOPT_NOSIGNAL(3)</i> is set to 1L, your application
    needs to deal with the risk of a SIGPIPE (that at least the OpenSSL backend
    can trigger). Note that setting <i>CURLOPT_NOSIGNAL(3)</i> to 0L does not
    work in a threaded situation as there is a race condition where libcurl
    risks restoring the former signal handler while another thread should still
    ignore it.</p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="Name_resolving"><a class="permalink" href="#Name_resolving">Name
  resolving</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The <b>gethostbyname</b> or <b>getaddrinfo</b> and other name
    resolving system calls used by libcurl are provided by your operating system
    and must be thread safe. It is important that libcurl can find and use
    thread safe versions of these and other system calls, as otherwise it cannot
    function fully thread safe. Some operating systems are known to have faulty
    thread implementations. We have previously received problem reports on *BSD
    (at least in the past, they may be working fine these days). Some operating
    systems that are known to have solid and working thread support are Linux,
    Solaris and Windows.</p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="curl_global_*_functions"><a class="permalink" href="#curl_global_*_functions">curl_global_*
  functions</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">These functions are thread-safe since libcurl 7.84.0 if
    <i>curl_version_info(3)</i> has the <b>CURL_VERSION_THREADSAFE</b> feature
    bit set (most platforms).</p>
<p class="Pp">If these functions are not thread-safe and you are using libcurl
    with multiple threads it is especially important that before use you call
    <i>curl_global_init(3)</i> or <i>curl_global_init_mem(3)</i> to explicitly
    initialize the library and its dependents, rather than rely on the
    &quot;lazy&quot; fail-safe initialization that takes place the first time
    <i>curl_easy_init(3)</i> is called. For an in-depth explanation refer to
    <i>libcurl(3)</i> section <b>GLOBAL CONSTANTS</b>.</p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="Memory_functions"><a class="permalink" href="#Memory_functions">Memory
  functions</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">These functions, provided either by your operating system or your
    own replacements, must be thread safe. You can use
    <i>curl_global_init_mem(3)</i> to set your own replacement memory
  functions.</p>
