This document is the master document which records all written policies about
  how the Perl 5 Porters collectively develop and maintain the Perl core.

<h2 class="Ss" id="Perl_5_Porters"><a class="permalink" href="#Perl_5_Porters">Perl
  5 Porters</a></h2>
Subscribers to perl5-porters (the porters themselves) come in several flavours.
  Some are quiet curious lurkers, who rarely pitch in and instead watch the
  ongoing development to ensure they're forewarned of new changes or features in
  Perl. Some are representatives of vendors, who are there to make sure that
  Perl continues to compile and work on their platforms. Some patch any reported
  bug that they know how to fix, some are actively patching their pet area
  (threads, Win32, the regexp -engine), while others seem to do nothing but
  complain. In other words, it's your usual mix of technical people.
<p class="Pp">Over this group of porters presides Larry Wall. He has the final
    word in what does and does not change in any of the Perl programming
    languages. These days, Larry spends most of his time on Perl 6, while Perl 5
    is shepherded by a &quot;pumpking&quot;, a porter responsible for deciding
    what goes into each release and ensuring that releases happen on a regular
    basis.</p>
<p class="Pp">Larry sees Perl development along the lines of the US government:
    there's the Legislature (the porters), the Executive branch (the -pumpking),
    and the Supreme Court (Larry). The legislature can discuss and submit
    patches to the executive branch all they like, but the executive branch is
    free to veto them. Rarely, the Supreme Court will side with the executive
    branch over the legislature, or the legislature over the executive branch.
    Mostly, however, the legislature and the executive branch are supposed to
    get along and work out their differences without impeachment or court
  cases.</p>
<p class="Pp">You might sometimes see reference to Rule 1 and Rule 2. Larry's
    power as Supreme Court is expressed in The Rules:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>1.</dt>
  <dd>Larry is always by definition right about how Perl should behave. This
      means he has final veto power on the core functionality.</dd>
  <dt>2.</dt>
  <dd>Larry is allowed to change his mind about any matter at a later date,
      regardless of whether he previously invoked Rule 1.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Got that? Larry is always right, even when he was wrong. It's rare
    to see either Rule exercised, but they are often alluded to.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="MAINTENANCE_AND_SUPPORT"><a class="permalink" href="#MAINTENANCE_AND_SUPPORT">MAINTENANCE
  AND SUPPORT</a></h1>
Perl 5 is developed by a community, not a corporate entity. Every change
  contributed to the Perl core is the result of a donation. Typically, these
  donations are contributions of code or time by individual members of our
  community. On occasion, these donations come in the form of corporate or
  organizational sponsorship of a particular individual or project.
<p class="Pp">As a volunteer organization, the commitments we make are heavily
    dependent on the goodwill and hard work of individuals who have no
    obligation to contribute to Perl.</p>
<p class="Pp">That being said, we value Perl's stability and security and have
    long had an unwritten covenant with the broader Perl community to support
    and maintain releases of Perl.</p>
<p class="Pp">This document codifies the support and maintenance commitments
    that the Perl community should expect from Perl's developers:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>We &quot;officially&quot; support the two most recent stable release
      series. 5.14.x and earlier are now out of support. As of the release of
      5.20.0, we will &quot;officially&quot; end support for Perl 5.16.x, other
      than providing security updates as described below.</li>
  <li>To the best of our ability, we will attempt to fix critical issues in the
      two most recent stable 5.x release series. Fixes for the current release
      series take precedence over fixes for the previous release series.</li>
  <li>To the best of our ability, we will provide &quot;critical&quot; security
      patches / releases for any major version of Perl whose 5.x.0 release was
      within the past three years. We can only commit to providing these for the
      most recent .y release in any 5.x.y series.</li>
  <li>We will not provide security updates or bug fixes for development releases
      of Perl.</li>
  <li>We encourage vendors to ship the most recent supported release of Perl at
      the time of their code freeze.</li>
  <li>As a vendor, you may have a requirement to backport security fixes beyond
      our 3 year support commitment. We can provide limited support and advice
      to you as you do so and, where possible will try to apply those patches to
      the relevant -maint branches in git, though we may or may not choose to
      make numbered releases or &quot;official&quot; patches available. Contact
      us at &lt;perl5-security-report@perl.org&gt; to begin that process.</li>
</ul>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="BACKWARD_COMPATIBILITY_AND_DEPRECATION"><a class="permalink" href="#BACKWARD_COMPATIBILITY_AND_DEPRECATION">BACKWARD
  COMPATIBILITY AND DEPRECATION</a></h1>
Our community has a long-held belief that backward-compatibility is a virtue,
  even when the functionality in question is a design flaw.
<p class="Pp">We would all love to unmake some mistakes we've made over the past
    decades. Living with every design error we've ever made can lead to painful
    stagnation. Unwinding our mistakes is very, very difficult. Doing so without
    actively harming our users is nearly impossible.</p>
<p class="Pp">Lately, ignoring or actively opposing compatibility with earlier
    versions of Perl has come into vogue. Sometimes, a change is proposed which
    wants to usurp syntax which previously had another meaning. Sometimes, a
    change wants to improve previously-crazy semantics.</p>
<p class="Pp">Down this road lies madness.</p>
<p class="Pp">Requiring end-user programmers to change just a few language
    constructs, even language constructs which no well-educated developer would
    ever intentionally use is tantamount to saying &quot;you should not upgrade
    to a new release of Perl unless you have 100% test coverage and can do a
    full manual audit of your codebase.&quot; If we were to have tools capable
    of reliably upgrading Perl source code from one version of Perl to another,
    this concern could be significantly mitigated.</p>
<p class="Pp">We want to ensure that Perl continues to grow and flourish in the
    coming years and decades, but not at the expense of our user community.</p>
<p class="Pp">Existing syntax and semantics should only be marked for
    destruction in very limited circumstances. If a given language feature's
    continued inclusion in the language will cause significant harm to the
    language or prevent us from making needed changes to the runtime, then it
    may be considered for deprecation.</p>
<p class="Pp">Any language change which breaks backward-compatibility should be
    able to be enabled or disabled lexically. Unless code at a given scope
    declares that it wants the new behavior, that new behavior should be
    disabled. Which backward-incompatible changes are controlled implicitly by a
    'use v5.x.y' is a decision which should be made by the pumpking in
    consultation with the community.</p>
<p class="Pp">When a backward-incompatible change can't be toggled lexically,
    the decision to change the language must be considered very, very carefully.
    If it's possible to move the old syntax or semantics out of the core
    language and into XS-land, that XS module should be enabled by default
    unless the user declares that they want a newer revision of Perl.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, we've held ourselves to a far higher standard than
    backward-compatibility -- bugward-compatibility. Any accident of
    implementation or unintentional side-effect of running some bit of code has
    been considered to be a feature of the language to be defended with the same
    zeal as any other feature or functionality. No matter how frustrating these
    unintentional features may be to us as we continue to improve Perl, these
    unintentional features often deserve our protection. It is very important
    that existing software written in Perl continue to work correctly. If
    end-user developers have adopted a bug as a feature, we need to treat it as
    such.</p>
<p class="Pp">New syntax and semantics which don't break existing language
    constructs and syntax have a much lower bar. They merely need to prove
    themselves to be useful, elegant, well designed, and well tested.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Terminology"><a class="permalink" href="#Terminology">Terminology</a></h2>
To make sure we're talking about the same thing when we discuss the removal of
  features or functionality from the Perl core, we have specific definitions for
  a few words and phrases.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>experimental</dt>
  <dd>If something in the Perl core is marked as <b>experimental</b>, we may
      change its behaviour, deprecate or remove it without notice. While we'll
      always do our best to smooth the transition path for users of experimental
      features, you should contact the perl5-porters mailinglist if you find an
      experimental feature useful and want to help shape its future.</dd>
  <dt>deprecated</dt>
  <dd>If something in the Perl core is marked as <b>deprecated</b>, we may
      remove it from the core in the future, though we might not. Generally,
      backward incompatible changes will have deprecation warnings for two
      release cycles before being removed, but may be removed after just one
      cycle if the risk seems quite low or the benefits quite high.
    <p class="Pp">As of Perl 5.12, deprecated features and modules warn the user
        as they're used. When a module is deprecated, it will also be made
        available on CPAN. Installing it from CPAN will silence deprecation
        warnings for that module.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you use a deprecated feature or module and believe that its
        removal from the Perl core would be a mistake, please contact the
        perl5-porters mailinglist and plead your case. We don't deprecate things
        without a good reason, but sometimes there's a counterargument we
        haven't considered. Historically, we did not distinguish between
        &quot;deprecated&quot; and &quot;discouraged&quot; features.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>discouraged</dt>
  <dd>From time to time, we may mark language constructs and features which we
      consider to have been mistakes as <b>discouraged</b>. Discouraged features
      aren't currently candidates for removal, but we may later deprecate them
      if they're found to stand in the way of a significant improvement to the
      Perl core.</dd>
  <dt>removed</dt>
  <dd>Once a feature, construct or module has been marked as deprecated, we may
      remove it from the Perl core. Unsurprisingly, we say we've <b>removed</b>
      these things. When a module is removed, it will no longer ship with Perl,
      but will continue to be available on CPAN.</dd>

<h1 class="Sh" id="MAINTENANCE_BRANCHES"><a class="permalink" href="#MAINTENANCE_BRANCHES">MAINTENANCE
  BRANCHES</a></h1>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>New releases of maint should contain as few changes as possible. If there
      is any question about whether a given patch might merit inclusion in a
      maint release, then it almost certainly should not be included.</li>
  <li>Portability fixes, such as changes to Configure and the files in hints/
      are acceptable. Ports of Perl to a new platform, architecture or OS
      release that involve changes to the implementation are NOT
    acceptable.</li>
  <li>Acceptable documentation updates are those that correct factual errors,
      explain significant bugs or deficiencies in the current implementation, or
      fix broken markup.</li>
  <li>Patches that add new warnings or errors or deprecate features are not
      acceptable.</li>
  <li>Patches that fix crashing bugs that do not otherwise change Perl's
      functionality or negatively impact performance are acceptable.</li>
  <li>Patches that fix CVEs or security issues are acceptable, but should be run
      through the perl5-security-report@perl.org mailing list rather than
      applied directly.</li>
  <li>Patches that fix regressions in perl's behavior relative to previous
      releases are acceptable.</li>
  <li>Updates to dual-life modules should consist of minimal patches to fix
      crashing or security issues (as above).</li>
  <li>Minimal patches that fix platform-specific test failures or build or
      installation issues are acceptable. When these changes are made to
      dual-life modules for which CPAN is canonical, any changes should be
      coordinated with the upstream author.</li>
  <li>New versions of dual-life modules should NOT be imported into maint. Those
      belong in the next stable series.</li>
  <li>Patches that add or remove features are not acceptable.</li>
  <li>Patches that break binary compatibility are not acceptable. (Please talk
      to a pumpking.)</li>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Getting_changes_into_a_maint_branch"><a class="permalink" href="#Getting_changes_into_a_maint_branch">Getting
  changes into a maint branch</a></h2>
Historically, only the pumpking cherry-picked changes from bleadperl into
  maintperl. This has scaling problems. At the same time, maintenance branches
  of stable versions of Perl need to be treated with great care. To that end, as
  of Perl 5.12, we have a new process for maint branches.
<p class="Pp">Any committer may cherry-pick any commit from blead to a maint
    branch if they send mail to perl5-porters announcing their intent to
    cherry-pick a specific commit along with a rationale for doing so and at
    least two other committers respond to the list giving their assent. (This
    policy applies to current and former pumpkings, as well as other
    committers.)</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="A_Social_Contract_about_Artistic_Control"><a class="permalink" href="#A_Social_Contract_about_Artistic_Control">A
  Social Contract about Artistic Control</a></h2>
What follows is a statement about artistic control, defined as the ability of
  authors of packages to guide the future of their code and maintain control
  over their work. It is a recognition that authors should have control over
  their work, and that it is a responsibility of the rest of the Perl community
  to ensure that they retain this control. It is an attempt to document the
  standards to which we, as Perl developers, intend to hold ourselves. It is an
  attempt to write down rough guidelines about the respect we owe each other as
  Perl developers.
<p class="Pp">This statement is not a legal contract. This statement is not a
    legal document in any way, shape, or form. Perl is distributed under the GNU
    Public License and under the Artistic License; those are the precise legal
    terms. This statement isn't about the law or licenses. It's about community,
    mutual respect, trust, and good-faith cooperation.</p>
<p class="Pp">We recognize that the Perl core, defined as the software
    distributed with the heart of Perl itself, is a joint project on the part of
    all of us. From time to time, a script, module, or set of modules (hereafter
    referred to simply as a &quot;module&quot;) will prove so widely useful
    and/or so integral to the correct functioning of Perl itself that it should
    be distributed with the Perl core. This should never be done without the
    author's explicit consent, and a clear recognition on all parts that this
    means the module is being distributed under the same terms as Perl itself. A
    module author should realize that inclusion of a module into the Perl core
    will necessarily mean some loss of control over it, since changes may
    occasionally have to be made on short notice or for consistency with the
    rest of Perl.</p>
<p class="Pp">Once a module has been included in the Perl core, however,
    everyone involved in maintaining Perl should be aware that the module is
    still the property of the original author unless the original author
    explicitly gives up their ownership of it. In particular:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>The version of the module in the Perl core should still be considered the
      work of the original author. All patches, bug reports, and so forth should
      be fed back to them. Their development directions should be respected
      whenever possible.</li>
  <li>Patches may be applied by the pumpkin holder without the explicit
      cooperation of the module author if and only if they are very minor,
      time-critical in some fashion (such as urgent security fixes), or if the
      module author cannot be reached. Those patches must still be given back to
      the author when possible, and if the author decides on an alternate fix in
      their version, that fix should be strongly preferred unless there is a
      serious problem with it. Any changes not endorsed by the author should be
      marked as such, and the contributor of the change acknowledged.</li>
  <li>The version of the module distributed with Perl should, whenever possible,
      be the latest version of the module as distributed by the author (the
      latest non-beta version in the case of public Perl releases), although the
      pumpkin holder may hold off on upgrading the version of the module
      distributed with Perl to the latest version until the latest version has
      had sufficient testing.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">In other words, the author of a module should be considered to
    have final say on modifications to their module whenever possible (bearing
    in mind that it's expected that everyone involved will work together and
    arrive at reasonable compromises when there are disagreements).</p>
<p class="Pp">As a last resort, however:</p>
<p class="Pp">If the author's vision of the future of their module is
    sufficiently different from the vision of the pumpkin holder and
    perl5-porters as a whole so as to cause serious problems for Perl, the
    pumpkin holder may choose to formally fork the version of the module in the
    Perl core from the one maintained by the author. This should not be done
    lightly and should <b>always</b> if at all possible be done only after
    direct input from Larry. If this is done, it must then be made explicit in
    the module as distributed with the Perl core that it is a forked version and
    that while it is based on the original author's work, it is no longer
    maintained by them. This must be noted in both the documentation and in the
    comments in the source of the module.</p>
<p class="Pp">Again, this should be a last resort only. Ideally, this should
    never happen, and every possible effort at cooperation and compromise should
    be made before doing this. If it does prove necessary to fork a module for
    the overall health of Perl, proper credit must be given to the original
    author in perpetuity and the decision should be constantly re-evaluated to
    see if a remerging of the two branches is possible down the road.</p>
<p class="Pp">In all dealings with contributed modules, everyone maintaining
    Perl should keep in mind that the code belongs to the original author, that
    they may not be on perl5-porters at any given time, and that a patch is not
    official unless it has been integrated into the author's copy of the module.
    To aid with this, and with points #1, #2, and #3 above, contact information
    for the authors of all contributed modules should be kept with the Perl
    distribution.</p>
<p class="Pp">Finally, the Perl community as a whole recognizes that respect for
    ownership of code, respect for artistic control, proper credit, and active
    effort to prevent unintentional code skew or communication gaps is vital to
    the health of the community and Perl itself. Members of a community should
    not normally have to resort to rules and laws to deal with each other, and
    this document, although it contains rules so as to be clear, is about an
    attitude and general approach. The first step in any dispute should be open
    communication, respect for opposing views, and an attempt at a compromise.
    In nearly every circumstance nothing more will be necessary, and certainly
    no more drastic measure should be used until every avenue of communication
    and discussion has failed.</p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DOCUMENTATION"><a class="permalink" href="#DOCUMENTATION">DOCUMENTATION</a></h1>
Perl's documentation is an important resource for our users. It's incredibly
  important for Perl's documentation to be reasonably coherent and to accurately
  reflect the current implementation.
<p class="Pp">Just as P5P collectively maintains the codebase, we collectively
    maintain the documentation. Writing a particular bit of documentation
    doesn't give an author control of the future of that documentation. At the
    same time, just as source code changes should match the style of their
    surrounding blocks, so should documentation changes.</p>
<p class="Pp">Examples in documentation should be illustrative of the concept
    they're explaining. Sometimes, the best way to show how a language feature
    works is with a small program the reader can run without modification. More
    often, examples will consist of a snippet of code containing only the
    &quot;important&quot; bits. The definition of &quot;important&quot; varies
    from snippet to snippet. Sometimes it's important to declare
    <span class="Li">&quot;use strict&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;use warnings&quot;</span>, initialize all variables
    and fully catch every error condition. More often than not, though, those
    things obscure the lesson the example was intended to teach.</p>
<p class="Pp">As Perl is developed by a global team of volunteers, our
    documentation often contains spellings which look funny to <i>somebody</i>.
    Choice of American/British/Other spellings is left as an exercise for the
    author of each bit of documentation. When patching documentation, try to
    emulate the documentation around you, rather than changing the existing
    prose.</p>
<p class="Pp">In general, documentation should describe what Perl does
    &quot;now&quot; rather than what it used to do. It's perfectly reasonable to
    include notes in documentation about how behaviour has changed from previous
    releases, but, with very few exceptions, documentation isn't
    &quot;dual-life&quot; -- it doesn't need to fully describe how all old
    versions used to work.</p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="STANDARDS_OF_CONDUCT"><a class="permalink" href="#STANDARDS_OF_CONDUCT">STANDARDS
  OF CONDUCT</a></h1>
The official forum for the development of perl is the perl5-porters mailing
  list, mentioned above, and its bugtracker at rt.perl.org. All participants in
  discussion there are expected to adhere to a standard of conduct.
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Always be civil.</li>
  <li>Heed the moderators.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">Civility is simple: stick to the facts while avoiding demeaning
    remarks and sarcasm. It is not enough to be factual. You must also be civil.
    Responding in kind to incivility is not acceptable.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the list moderators tell you that you are not being civil,
    carefully consider how your words have appeared before responding in any
    way. You may protest, but repeated protest in the face of a repeatedly
    reaffirmed decision is not acceptable.</p>
<p class="Pp">Unacceptable behavior will result in a public and clearly
    identified warning. Repeated unacceptable behavior will result in removal
    from the mailing list. The first removal is for one month. Subsequent
    removals will double in length. After six months with no warning, a user's
    ban length is reset. Removals, like warnings, are public.</p>
<p class="Pp">The list of moderators will be public knowledge. At present, it
    is: Aaron Crane, Andy Dougherty, Ricardo Signes, Steffen Mueller.</p>
