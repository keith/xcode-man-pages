   Set up some character translations and predefined strings.  \*(-- will
   give an unbreakable dash, \*(PI will give pi, \*(L" will give a left
   double quote, and \*(R" will give a right double quote.  \*(C+ will
   give a nicer C++.  Capital omega is used to do unbreakable dashes and
   therefore won't be available.  \*(C` and \*(C' expand to `' in nroff,
   nothing in troff, for use with C<>.

Moose::Manual::Support - Policies regarding support, releases, and

<h1 class="Sh" id="SUPPORT_POLICY"><a class="permalink" href="#SUPPORT_POLICY">SUPPORT
  POLICY</a></h1>
There are two principles to Moose's policy of supported behavior.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>1.</dt>
  <dd>Moose favors correctness over everything.</dd>
  <dt>2.</dt>
  <dd>Moose supports documented and tested behavior, not accidental behavior or
      side effects.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">If a behavior has never been documented or tested, the behavior is
    <i>officially</i> undefined. Relying upon undocumented and untested behavior
    is done at your own risk.</p>
<p class="Pp">If a behavior is documented or tested but found to be incorrect
    later, the behavior will go through a deprecation period. During the
    deprecation period, use of that feature will cause a warning. Eventually,
    the deprecated feature will be removed.</p>
<p class="Pp">In some cases, it is not possible to deprecate a behavior. In this
    case, the behavior will simply be changed in a major release.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="RELEASE_SCHEDULE"><a class="permalink" href="#RELEASE_SCHEDULE">RELEASE
  SCHEDULE</a></h1>
Moose is on a system of quarterly major releases, with minor releases as needed
  between major releases. A minor release is defined as one that makes every
  attempt to preserve backwards compatibility. Currently this means that we did
  not introduce any new dependency conflicts, and that we did not make any
  changes to documented or tested behavior (this typically means that minor
  releases will not change any existing tests in the test suite, although they
  can add new ones). A minor release can include new features and bug fixes.
<p class="Pp">Major releases may be backwards incompatible. Moose prioritizes
    correctness over backwards compatibility or performance; see the DEPRECATION
    POLICY to understand how backwards incompatible changes are announced.</p>
<p class="Pp">Major releases are scheduled to happen during fixed release
    windows. If the window is missed, then there will not be a major release
    until the next release window. The release windows are one month long, and
    occur during the months of January, April, July, and October.</p>
<p class="Pp">Before a major release, a series of development releases will be
    made so that users can test the upcoming major release before it is
    distributed to CPAN. It is in the best interests of everyone involved if
    these releases are tested as widely as possible.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DEPRECATION_POLICY"><a class="permalink" href="#DEPRECATION_POLICY">DEPRECATION
  POLICY</a></h1>
Moose has always prioritized correctness over performance and backwards
  compatibility.
<p class="Pp">Major deprecations or API changes are documented in the Changes
    file as well as in Moose::Manual::Delta. The Moose developers will also make
    an effort to warn users of upcoming deprecations and breakage through the
    Moose blog (http://blog.moose.perl.org).</p>
<p class="Pp">Deprecated APIs will be preserved for at least one year <i>after
    the major</i> <i>release which deprecates that API</i>. Deprecated APIs will
    only be removed in a major release.</p>
<p class="Pp">Moose will also warn during installation if the version of Moose
    being installed will break an installed dependency. Unfortunately, due to
    the nature of the Perl install process these warnings may be easy to
  miss.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY"><a class="permalink" href="#BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY">BACKWARDS
  COMPATIBILITY</a></h1>
We try to ensure compatibility by having a extensive test suite (last count over
  18000 tests), as well as testing a number of packages (currently just under
  100 packages) that depend on Moose before any release.
<p class="Pp">The current list of downstream dependencies that are tested is in
    <span class="Li">&quot;xt/author/test-my-dependents.t&quot;</span>.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="VERSION_NUMBERS"><a class="permalink" href="#VERSION_NUMBERS">VERSION
  NUMBERS</a></h1>
Moose version numbers consist of three parts, in the form X.YYZZ. The X is the
  &quot;special magic number&quot; that only gets changed for really big
  changes. Think of this as being like the &quot;5&quot; in Perl 5.12.1.
<p class="Pp">The YY portion is the major version number. Moose uses even
    numbers for stable releases, and odd numbers for trial releases. The ZZ is
    the minor version, and it simply increases monotonically. It starts at
    &quot;00&quot; each time a new major version is released.</p>
<p class="Pp">Semantically, this means that any two releases which share a major
    version should be API-compatible with each other. In other words, 2.0200,
    2.0201, and 2.0274 are all API-compatible.</p>
<p class="Pp">Prior to version 2.0, Moose version numbers were monotonically
    incrementing two decimal values (0.01, 0.02, ... 1.11, 1.12, etc.).</p>
<p class="Pp">Moose was declared production ready at version 0.18 (via
    &lt;http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=608144&gt;).</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="PERL_VERSION_COMPATIBILITY"><a class="permalink" href="#PERL_VERSION_COMPATIBILITY">PERL
  VERSION COMPATIBILITY</a></h1>
As of version 2.16, Moose will officially support being run on perl 5.10.1+. Our
  current policy is to support the earliest version of Perl shipped in the
  latest stable release of any major operating system (this tends to mean
  CentOS). We will provide at least six months notice (two major releases) when
  we decide to increase the officially supported Perl version.
<p class="Pp">&quot;Officially supported&quot; does not mean that these are the
    only versions of Perl that Moose will work with. Our declared perl
    dependency will remain at 5.8.3 as long as our test suite continues to pass
    on 5.8.3. What this does mean is that the core Moose dev team will not be
    spending any time fixing bugs on versions that aren't officially supported,
    and new contributions will not be rejected due to being incompatible with
    older versions of perl except in the most trivial of cases. We will,
    however, still welcome patches to make Moose compatible with earlier
    versions, if other people are still interested in maintaining compatibility.
    As such, the current minimum required version of 5.8.3 will remain for as
    long as downstream users are happy to assist with maintenance.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that although performance regressions are acceptable in order
    to maintain backwards compatibility (as long as they only affect the older
    versions), functionality changes and buggy behavior will not be. If it
    becomes impossible to provide identical functionality between modern Perl
    versions and unsupported Perl versions, we will increase our declared perl
    dependency instead.</p>
