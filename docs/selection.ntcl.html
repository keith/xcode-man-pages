   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

<p class="Pp">This command provides a Tcl interface to the X selection mechanism
    and implements the full selection functionality described in the X
    Inter-Client Communication Conventions Manual (ICCCM).</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that for management of the CLIPBOARD selection (see below),
    the <b>clipboard</b> command may also be used.</p>
<p class="Pp">The first argument to <b>selection</b> determines the format of
    the rest of the arguments and the behavior of the command. The following
    forms are currently supported:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="selection"><a class="permalink" href="#selection"><b>selection
    clear</b> ?<b>-displayof</b> <i>window</i>? ?<b>-selection</b>
    <i>selection</i>?</a></dt>
  <dd>If <i>selection</i> exists anywhere on <i>window</i>'s display, clear it
      so that no window owns the selection anymore. <i>Selection</i> specifies
      the X selection that should be cleared, and should be an atom name such as
      PRIMARY or CLIPBOARD; see the Inter-Client Communication Conventions
      Manual for complete details. <i>Selection</i> defaults to PRIMARY and
      <i>window</i> defaults to &#x201C;.&#x201D;. Returns an empty string.</dd>
  <dt id="selection~2"><a class="permalink" href="#selection~2"><b>selection
    get</b> ?<b>-displayof</b> <i>window</i>? ?<b>-selection</b>
    <i>selection</i>? ?<b>-type</b> <i>type</i>?</a></dt>
  <dd>Retrieves the value of <i>selection</i> from <i>window</i>'s display and
      returns it as a result. <i>Selection</i> defaults to PRIMARY and
      <i>window</i> defaults to &#x201C;.&#x201D;. <i>Type</i> specifies the
      form in which the selection is to be returned (the desired
      &#x201C;target&#x201D; for conversion, in ICCCM terminology), and should
      be an atom name such as STRING or FILE_NAME; see the Inter-Client
      Communication Conventions Manual for complete details. <i>Type</i>
      defaults to STRING. The selection owner may choose to return the selection
      in any of several different representation formats, such as STRING,
      UTF8_STRING, ATOM, INTEGER, etc. (this format is different than the
      selection type; see the ICCCM for all the confusing details). If the
      selection is returned in a non-string format, such as INTEGER or ATOM, the
      <b>selection</b> command converts it to string format as a collection of
      fields separated by spaces: atoms are converted to their textual names,
      and anything else is converted to hexadecimal integers. Note that
      <b>selection get</b> does not retrieve the selection in the UTF8_STRING
      format unless told to.</dd>
  <dt id="selection~3"><a class="permalink" href="#selection~3"><b>selection
    handle</b> ?<b>-selection</b> <i>s</i>? ?<b>-type</b> <i>t</i>?
    ?<b>-format</b> <i>f</i>? <i>window command</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Creates a handler for selection requests, such that <i>command</i> will be
      executed whenever selection <i>s</i> is owned by <i>window</i> and someone
      attempts to retrieve it in the form given by type <i>t</i> (e.g. <i>t</i>
      is specified in the <b>selection get</b> command). <i>S</i> defaults to
      PRIMARY, <i>t</i> defaults to STRING, and <i>f</i> defaults to STRING. If
      <i>command</i> is an empty string then any existing handler for
      <i>window</i>, <i>t</i>, and <i>s</i> is removed. Note that when the
      selection is handled as type STRING it is also automatically handled as
      type UTF8_STRING as well.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">When <i>selection</i> is requested, <i>window</i> is the selection
    owner, and <i>type</i> is the requested type, <i>command</i> will be
    executed as a Tcl command with two additional numbers appended to it (with
    space separators). The two additional numbers are <i>offset</i> and
    <i>maxChars</i>: <i>offset</i> specifies a starting character position in
    the selection and <i>maxChars</i> gives the maximum number of characters to
    retrieve. The command should return a value consisting of at most
    <i>maxChars</i> of the selection, starting at position <i>offset</i>. For
    very large selections (larger than <i>maxChars</i>) the selection will be
    retrieved using several invocations of <i>command</i> with increasing
    <i>offset</i> values. If <i>command</i> returns a string whose length is
    less than <i>maxChars</i>, the return value is assumed to include all of the
    remainder of the selection; if the length of <i>command</i>'s result is
    equal to <i>maxChars</i> then <i>command</i> will be invoked again, until it
    eventually returns a result shorter than <i>maxChars</i>. The value of
    <i>maxChars</i> will always be relatively large (thousands of
  characters).</p>
<p class="Pp">If <i>command</i> returns an error then the selection retrieval is
    rejected just as if the selection did not exist at all.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>format</i> argument specifies the representation that
    should be used to transmit the selection to the requester (the second column
    of Table 2 of the ICCCM), and defaults to STRING. If <i>format</i> is
    STRING, the selection is transmitted as 8-bit ASCII characters (i.e. just in
    the form returned by <i>command</i>, in the system <b>encoding</b>; the
    UTF8_STRING format always uses UTF-8 as its encoding). If <i>format</i> is
    ATOM, then the return value from <i>command</i> is divided into fields
    separated by white space; each field is converted to its atom value, and the
    32-bit atom value is transmitted instead of the atom name. For any other
    <i>format</i>, the return value from <i>command</i> is divided into fields
    separated by white space and each field is converted to a 32-bit integer; an
    array of integers is transmitted to the selection requester.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>format</i> argument is needed only for compatibility with
    selection requesters that do not use Tk. If Tk is being used to retrieve the
    selection then the value is converted back to a string at the requesting
    end, so <i>format</i> is irrelevant.</p>

    own</b> ?<b>-command</b> <i>command</i>? ?<b>-selection</b>
    <i>selection</i>? <i>window</i></a></dt>
  <dd>The first form of <b>selection own</b> returns the path name of the window
      in this application that owns <i>selection</i> on the display containing
      <i>window</i>, or an empty string if no window in this application owns
      the selection. <i>Selection</i> defaults to PRIMARY and <i>window</i>
      defaults to &#x201C;.&#x201D;.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The second form of <b>selection own</b> causes <i>window</i> to
    become the new owner of <i>selection</i> on <i>window</i>'s display,
    returning an empty string as result. The existing owner, if any, is notified
    that it has lost the selection. If <i>command</i> is specified, it is a Tcl
    script to execute when some other window claims ownership of the selection
    away from <i>window</i>. <i>Selection</i> defaults to PRIMARY.</p>

<p class="Pp">On X11 platforms, one of the standard selections available is the

    using Tk:</p>

<br/>
   puts &quot;Selection PRIMARY supports type $type&quot;
}</pre>
</div>
