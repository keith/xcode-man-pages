encoding::warnings - Warn on implicit encoding conversions
</section>
<section class="Sh">

This document describes version 0.13 of encoding::warnings, released June 20,
  2016.

As of Perl 5.26.0, this module has no effect. The internal Perl feature that was
  used to implement this module has been removed. In recent years, much work has
  been done on the Perl core to eliminate discrepancies in the treatment of
  upgraded versus downgraded strings. In addition, the encoding pragma, which
  caused many of the problems, is no longer supported. Thus, the warnings this
  module produced are no longer necessary.
<p class="Pp">Hence, if you load this module on Perl 5.26.0, you will get one
    warning that the module is no longer supported; and the module will do
    nothing thereafter.</p>

  of the problem</a></h2>
By default, there is a fundamental asymmetry in Perl's unicode model: implicit
  upgrading from byte-strings to unicode-strings assumes that they were encoded
  in <i>ISO 8859-1 (Latin-1)</i>, but unicode-strings are downgraded with UTF-8
  encoding. This happens because the first 256 codepoints in Unicode happens to
  agree with Latin-1.
<p class="Pp">However, this silent upgrading can easily cause problems, if you
    happen to mix unicode strings with non-Latin1 data -- i.e. byte-strings
    encoded in UTF-8 or other encodings. The error will not manifest until the
    combined string is written to output, at which time it would be impossible
    to see where did the silent upgrading occur.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Detecting_the_problem"><a class="permalink" href="#Detecting_the_problem">Detecting
  the problem</a></h2>
This module simplifies the process of diagnosing such problems. Just put this
  line on top of your main program:
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    use encoding::warnings;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Afterwards, implicit upgrading of high-bit bytes will raise a
    warning. Ex.: <span class="Li">&quot;Bytes implicitly upgraded into wide
    characters as iso-8859-1 at</span> <span class="Li">- line
  7&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">However, strings composed purely of ASCII code points
    (<span class="Li">0x00</span>..<span class="Li">0x7F</span>) will <i>not</i>
    trigger this warning.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can also make the warnings fatal by importing this module
  as:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    use encoding::warnings 'FATAL';
</pre>

  the problem</a></h2>
Most of the time, this warning occurs when a byte-string is concatenated with a
  unicode-string. There are a number of ways to solve it:
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Upgrade both sides to unicode-strings
    <p class="Pp">If your program does not need compatibility for Perl 5.6 and
        earlier, the recommended approach is to apply appropriate IO
        disciplines, so all data in your program become unicode-strings. See
        encoding, open and &quot;binmode&quot; in perlfunc for how.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Downgrade both sides to byte-strings
    <p class="Pp">The other way works too, especially if you are sure that all
        your data are under the same encoding, or if compatibility with older
        versions of Perl is desired.</p>
    <p class="Pp">You may downgrade strings with
        <span class="Li">&quot;Encode::encode&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;utf8::encode&quot;</span>. See Encode and utf8
        for details.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Specify the encoding for implicit byte-string upgrading
    <p class="Pp">If you are confident that all byte-strings will be in a
        specific encoding like UTF-8, <i>and</i> need not support older versions
        of Perl, use the <span class="Li">&quot;encoding&quot;</span>
      pragma:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    use encoding 'utf8';
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Similarly, this will silence warnings from this module, and
        preserve the default behaviour:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    use encoding 'iso-8859-1';
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">However, note that <span class="Li">&quot;use
        encoding&quot;</span> actually had three distinct effects:</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>PerlIO layers for <b>STDIN</b> and <b>STDOUT</b>
    <p class="Pp">This is similar to what open pragma does.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Literal conversions
    <p class="Pp">This turns <i>all</i> literal string in your program into
        unicode-strings (equivalent to a <span class="Li">&quot;use
        utf8&quot;</span>), by decoding them using the specified encoding.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Implicit upgrading for byte-strings
    <p class="Pp">This will silence warnings from this module, as shown
      above.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">Because literal conversions also work on empty strings, it may
    surprise some people:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    use encoding 'big5';

    my $byte_string = pack(&quot;C*&quot;, 0xA4, 0x40);
    print length $a;    # 2 here.
    $a .= &quot;&quot;;           # concatenating with a unicode string...
    print length $a;    # 1 here!
</pre>
<p class="Pp">In other words, do not <span class="Li">&quot;use
    encoding&quot;</span> unless you are certain that the program will not deal
    with any raw, 8-bit binary data at all.</p>
<p class="Pp">However, the <span class="Li">&quot;Filter =&gt; 1&quot;</span>
    flavor of <span class="Li">&quot;use encoding&quot;</span> will <i>not</i>
    affect implicit upgrading for byte-strings, and is thus incapable of
    silencing warnings from this module. See encoding for more details.</p>

For Perl 5.9.4 or later, this module's effect is lexical.
<p class="Pp">For Perl versions prior to 5.9.4, this module affects the whole
