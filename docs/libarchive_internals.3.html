<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="OVERVIEW"><a class="permalink" href="#OVERVIEW">OVERVIEW</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The <code class="Nm">libarchive</code> library provides a flexible
    interface for reading and writing streaming archive files such as tar and
    cpio. Internally, it follows a modular layered design that should make it
    easy to add new archive and compression formats.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="GENERAL_ARCHITECTURE"><a class="permalink" href="#GENERAL_ARCHITECTURE">GENERAL
  ARCHITECTURE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Externally, libarchive exposes most operations through an opaque,
    object-style interface. The <a class="Xr">archive_entry(3)</a> objects store
    information about a single filesystem object. The rest of the library
    provides facilities to write <a class="Xr">archive_entry(3)</a> objects to
    archive files, read them from archive files, and write them to disk. (There
    are plans to add a facility to read <a class="Xr">archive_entry(3)</a>
    objects from disk as well.)</p>
<p class="Pp">The read and write APIs each have four layers: a public API layer,
    a format layer that understands the archive file format, a compression
    layer, and an I/O layer. The I/O layer is completely exposed to clients who
    can replace it entirely with their own functions.</p>
<p class="Pp">In order to provide as much consistency as possible for clients,
    some public functions are virtualized. Eventually, it should be possible for
    clients to open an archive or disk writer, and then use a single set of code
    to select and write entries, regardless of the target.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="READ_ARCHITECTURE"><a class="permalink" href="#READ_ARCHITECTURE">READ
  ARCHITECTURE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">From the outside, clients use the
    <a class="Xr">archive_read(3)</a> API to manipulate an
    <code class="Nm">archive</code> object to read entries and bodies from an
    archive stream. Internally, the <code class="Nm">archive</code> object is
    cast to an <code class="Nm">archive_read</code> object, which holds all
    read-specific data. The API has four layers: The lowest layer is the I/O
    layer. This layer can be overridden by clients, but most clients use the
    packaged I/O callbacks provided, for example, by
    <a class="Xr">archive_read_open_memory(3)</a>, and
    <a class="Xr">archive_read_open_fd(3)</a>. The compression layer calls the
    I/O layer to read bytes and decompresses them for the format layer. The
    format layer unpacks a stream of uncompressed bytes and creates
    <code class="Nm">archive_entry</code> objects from the incoming data. The
    API layer tracks overall state (for example, it prevents clients from
    reading data before reading a header) and invokes the format and compression
    layer operations through registered function pointers. In particular, the
    API layer drives the format-detection process: When opening the archive, it
    reads an initial block of data and offers it to each registered compression
    handler. The one with the highest bid is initialized with the first block.
    Similarly, the format handlers are polled to see which handler is the best
    for each archive. (Prior to 2.4.0, the format bidders were invoked for each
    entry, but this design hindered error recovery.)</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">I/O Layer and Client Callbacks</h2>
<p class="Pp">The read API goes to some lengths to be nice to clients. As a
    result, there are few restrictions on the behavior of the client
  callbacks.</p>
<p class="Pp">The client read callback is expected to provide a block of data on
    each call. A zero-length return does indicate end of file, but otherwise
    blocks may be as small as one byte or as large as the entire file. In
    particular, blocks may be of different sizes.</p>
<p class="Pp">The client skip callback returns the number of bytes actually
    skipped, which may be much smaller than the skip requested. The only
    requirement is that the skip not be larger. In particular, clients are
    allowed to return zero for any skip that they don't want to handle. The skip
    callback must never be invoked with a negative value.</p>
<p class="Pp">Keep in mind that not all clients are reading from disk: clients
    reading from networks may provide different-sized blocks on every request
    and cannot skip at all; advanced clients may use <a class="Xr">mmap(2)</a>
    to read the entire file into memory at once and return the entire file to
    libarchive as a single block; other clients may begin asynchronous I/O
    operations for the next block on each request.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Decompression_Layer"><a class="permalink" href="#Decompression_Layer">Decompression
  Layer</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The decompression layer not only handles decompression, it also
    buffers data so that the format handlers see a much nicer I/O model. The
    decompression API is a two stage peek/consume model. A read_ahead request
    specifies a minimum read amount; the decompression layer must provide a
    pointer to at least that much data. If more data is immediately available,
    it should return more: the format layer handles bulk data reads by asking
    for a minimum of one byte and then copying as much data as is available.</p>
<p class="Pp" id="consume">A subsequent call to the
    <a class="permalink" href="#consume"><code class="Fn">consume</code></a>()
    function advances the read pointer. Note that data returned from a
    <code class="Fn">read_ahead</code>() call is guaranteed to remain in place
    until the next call to <code class="Fn">read_ahead</code>(). Intervening
    calls to <code class="Fn">consume</code>() should not cause the data to
    move.</p>
<p class="Pp">Skip requests must always be handled exactly. Decompression
    handlers that cannot seek forward should not register a skip handler; the
    API layer fills in a generic skip handler that reads and discards data.</p>
<p class="Pp">A decompression handler has a specific lifecycle:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag Bl-compact">
  <dt id="__archive_read_register_compression">Registration/Configuration</dt>
  <dd>When the client invokes the public support function, the decompression
      handler invokes the internal
      <a class="permalink" href="#__archive_read_register_compression"><code class="Fn">__archive_read_register_compression</code></a>()
      function to provide bid and initialization functions. This function
      returns <code class="Cm">NULL</code> on error or else a pointer to a
      <code class="Cm">struct decompressor_t</code>. This structure contains a
      <var class="Va">void * config</var> slot that can be used for storing any
      customization information.</dd>
  <dt>Bid</dt>
  <dd>The bid function is invoked with a pointer and size of a block of data.
      The decompressor can access its config data through the
      <var class="Va">decompressor</var> element of the
      <code class="Cm">archive_read</code> object. The bid function is otherwise
      stateless. In particular, it must not perform any I/O operations.
    <p class="Pp">The value returned by the bid function indicates its
        suitability for handling this data stream. A bid of zero will ensure
        that this decompressor is never invoked. Return zero if magic number
        checks fail. Otherwise, your initial implementation should return the
        number of bits actually checked. For example, if you verify two full
        bytes and three bits of another byte, bid 19. Note that the initial
        block may be very short; be careful to only inspect the data you are
        given. (The current decompressors require two bytes for correct
        bidding.)</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Initialize</dt>
  <dd>The winning bidder will have its init function called. This function
      should initialize the remaining slots of the <var class="Va">struct
      decompressor_t</var> object pointed to by the
      <var class="Va">decompressor</var> element of the
      <var class="Va">archive_read</var> object. In particular, it should
      allocate any working data it needs in the <var class="Va">data</var> slot
      of that structure. The init function is called with the block of data that
      was used for tasting. At this point, the decompressor is responsible for
      all I/O requests to the client callbacks. The decompressor is free to read
      more data as and when necessary.</dd>
  <dt>Satisfy I/O requests</dt>
  <dd>The format handler will invoke the <var class="Va">read_ahead</var>,
      <var class="Va">consume</var>, and <var class="Va">skip</var> functions as
      needed.</dd>
  <dt>Finish</dt>
  <dd>The finish method is called only once when the archive is closed. It
      should release anything stored in the <var class="Va">data</var> and
      <var class="Va">config</var> slots of the
      <var class="Va">decompressor</var> object. It should not invoke the client
      close callback.</dd>
</dl>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">Format Layer</h2>
<p class="Pp">The read formats have a similar lifecycle to the decompression
    handlers:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag Bl-compact">
  <dt>Registration</dt>
  <dd>Allocate your private data and initialize your pointers.</dd>
  <dt id="read_ahead">Bid</dt>
  <dd>Formats bid by invoking the
      <a class="permalink" href="#read_ahead"><code class="Fn">read_ahead</code></a>()
      decompression method but not calling the <code class="Fn">consume</code>()
      method. This allows each bidder to look ahead in the input stream. Bidders
      should not look further ahead than necessary, as long look aheads put
      pressure on the decompression layer to buffer lots of data. Most formats
      only require a few hundred bytes of look ahead; look aheads of a few
      kilobytes are reasonable. (The ISO9660 reader sometimes looks ahead by
      48k, which should be considered an upper limit.)</dd>
  <dt>Read header</dt>
  <dd>The header read is usually the most complex part of any format. There are
      a few strategies worth mentioning: For formats such as tar or cpio,
      reading and parsing the header is straightforward since headers alternate
      with data. For formats that store all header data at the beginning of the
      file, the first header read request may have to read all headers into
      memory and store that data, sorted by the location of the file data.
      Subsequent header read requests will skip forward to the beginning of the
      file data and return the corresponding header.</dd>
  <dt>Read Data</dt>
  <dd>The read data interface supports sparse files; this requires that each
      call return a block of data specifying the file offset and size. This may
      require you to carefully track the location so that you can return
      accurate file offsets for each read. Remember that the decompressor will
      return as much data as it has. Generally, you will want to request one
      byte, examine the return value to see how much data is available, and
      possibly trim that to the amount you can use. You should invoke consume
      for each block just before you return it.</dd>
  <dt id="data_skip">Skip All Data</dt>
  <dd>The skip data call should skip over all file data and trailing padding.
      This is called automatically by the API layer just before each header
      read. It is also called in response to the client calling the public
      <a class="permalink" href="#data_skip"><code class="Fn">data_skip</code></a>()
      function.</dd>
  <dt>Cleanup</dt>
  <dd>On cleanup, the format should release all of its allocated memory.</dd>

<p class="Pp">The write_disk API is intended to look just like the write API to
    clients. Since it does not handle multiple formats or compression, it is not
    layered internally.</p>

<p class="Pp">The <code class="Nm">archive_read</code>,
    <code class="Nm">archive_write</code>, and
    <code class="Nm">archive_write_disk</code> objects all contain an initial
    <code class="Nm">archive</code> object which provides common support for a
    set of standard services. (Recall that ANSI/ISO C90 guarantees that you can
    cast freely between a pointer to a structure and a pointer to the first
    element of that structure.) The <code class="Nm">archive</code> object has a
    magic value that indicates which API this object is associated with, slots
    for storing error information, and function pointers for virtualized API
    functions.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="MISCELLANEOUS_NOTES"><a class="permalink" href="#MISCELLANEOUS_NOTES">MISCELLANEOUS
  NOTES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Connecting existing archiving libraries into libarchive is
    generally quite difficult. In particular, many existing libraries strongly
    assume that you are reading from a file; they seek forwards and backwards as
    necessary to locate various pieces of information. In contrast, libarchive
    never seeks backwards in its input, which sometimes requires very different
    approaches.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, libarchive's ISO9660 support operates very
    differently from most ISO9660 readers. The libarchive support utilizes a
    work-queue design that keeps a list of known entries sorted by their
    location in the input. Whenever libarchive's ISO9660 implementation is asked
    for the next header, checks this list to find the next item on the disk.
    Directories are parsed when they are encountered and new items are added to
    the list. This design relies heavily on the ISO9660 image being optimized so
    that directories always occur earlier on the disk than the files they
    describe.</p>
<p class="Pp">Depending on the specific format, such approaches may not be
    possible. The ZIP format specification, for example, allows archivers to
    store key information only at the end of the file. In theory, it is possible
    to create ZIP archives that cannot be read without seeking. Fortunately,
    such archives are very rare, and libarchive can read most ZIP archives,
    though it cannot always extract as much information as a dedicated ZIP
    program.</p>
