  <dt id="F_BARRIERFSYNC"><a class="permalink" href="#F_BARRIERFSYNC"><code class="Dv">F_BARRIERFSYNC</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Does the same thing as <a class="Xr">fsync(2)</a> then issues a barrier
      command to the drive (<var class="Fa">arg</var> is ignored). The barrier
      applies to I/O that have been flushed with <a class="Xr">fsync(2)</a> on
      the same device before. These operations are guaranteed to be persisted
      before any other I/O that would follow the barrier, although no assumption
      should be made on what has been persisted or not when this call returns.
      After the barrier has been issued, operations on other FDs that have been
      fsync'd before can still be re-ordered by the device, but not after the
      barrier. This is typically useful to guarantee valid state on disk when
      ordering is a concern but durability is not. A barrier can be used to
      order two phases of operations on a set of file descriptors and ensure
      that no file can possibly get persisted with the effect of the second
      phase without the effect of the first one. To do so, execute operations of
      phase one, then <a class="Xr">fsync(2)</a> each FD and issue a single
      barrier. Finally execute operations of phase two. This is currently
      implemented on HFS and APFS. It requires hardware support, which Apple
      SSDs are guaranteed to provide.</dd>
  <dt id="F_FULLFSYNC"><a class="permalink" href="#F_FULLFSYNC"><code class="Dv">F_FULLFSYNC</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Does the same thing as <a class="Xr">fsync(2)</a> then asks the drive to
      flush all buffered data to the permanent storage device
      (<var class="Fa">arg</var> is ignored). As this drains the entire queue of
      the device and acts as a barrier, data that had been fsync'd on the same
      device before is guaranteed to be persisted when this call returns. This
      is currently implemented on HFS, MS-DOS (FAT), Universal Disk Format (UDF)
      and APFS file systems. The operation may take quite a while to complete.
      Certain FireWire drives have also been known to ignore the request to
      flush their buffered data.</dd>

      <code class="Dv">SIGPIPE</code> generation is disabled for descriptor
      <var class="Fa">fildes</var>, while an <var class="Fa">arg</var> of zero

  <dd>Transfer any extra space in the file past the logical EOF (as previously
      allocated via <code class="Dv">F_PREALLOCATE</code>) to another file. The

      Both descriptors must reference regular files in the same volume.</dd>

        };</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The commands available for advisory record locking are as
  follows:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="F_GETLK"><a class="permalink" href="#F_GETLK"><code class="Dv">F_GETLK</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Get the first lock that blocks the lock description pointed to by the
      third argument, <var class="Fa">arg</var>, taken as a pointer to a
      <var class="Fa">struct flock</var> (see above). The information retrieved
      overwrites the information passed to <code class="Nm">fcntl</code> in the
      <var class="Fa">flock</var> structure. If no lock is found that would
      prevent this lock from being created, the structure is left unchanged by
      this function call except for the lock type which is set to
      <code class="Dv">F_UNLCK</code>. If a lock that does not support the
      discovery of lock ownership by process (one created by the
      <a class="Xr">flock(2)</a> system call or the <a class="Xr">open(2)</a>
      system call with the <code class="Dv">O_SHLOCK</code> or
      <code class="Dv">O_EXLOCK</code> flag) is found,
      <var class="Fa">l_pid</var> is set to -1.</dd>
  <dt id="F_SETLK"><a class="permalink" href="#F_SETLK"><code class="Dv">F_SETLK</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Set or clear a file segment lock according to the lock description pointed
      to by the third argument, <var class="Fa">arg</var>, taken as a pointer to
      a <var class="Fa">struct flock</var> (see above).
      <code class="Dv">F_SETLK</code> is used to establish shared (or read)
      locks <code class="Dv">(F_RDLCK)</code> or exclusive (or write) locks,
      <code class="Dv">(F_WRLCK)</code>, as well as remove either type of lock
      <code class="Dv">(F_UNLCK)</code>. If a shared or exclusive lock cannot be
      set, <code class="Nm">fcntl</code> returns immediately with
      <code class="Er">EAGAIN</code>.</dd>
  <dt id="F_SETLKW"><a class="permalink" href="#F_SETLKW"><code class="Dv">F_SETLKW</code></a></dt>
  <dd>This command is the same as <code class="Dv">F_SETLK</code> except that if
      a shared or exclusive lock is blocked by other locks, the process waits
      until the request can be satisfied. If a signal that is to be caught is
      received while <code class="Nm">fcntl</code> is waiting for a region, the
      <code class="Nm">fcntl</code> will be interrupted if the signal handler
      has not specified the <code class="Dv">SA_RESTART</code> (see
      <a class="Xr">sigaction(2)</a>).</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">When a shared lock has been set on a segment of a file, other
    processes can set shared locks on that segment or a portion of it. A shared
    lock prevents any other process from setting an exclusive lock on any
    portion of the protected area. A request for a shared lock fails if the file
    descriptor was not opened with read access.</p>
<p class="Pp">An exclusive lock prevents any other process from setting a shared
    lock or an exclusive lock on any portion of the protected area. A request
    for an exclusive lock fails if the file was not opened with write
  access.</p>
<p class="Pp">The value of <var class="Fa">l_whence</var> is
    <code class="Dv">SEEK_SET</code>, <code class="Dv">SEEK_CUR</code>, or
    <code class="Dv">SEEK_END</code> to indicate that the relative offset,
    <var class="Fa">l_start</var> bytes, will be measured from the start of the
    file, current position, or end of the file, respectively. The value of
    <var class="Fa">l_len</var> is the number of consecutive bytes to be locked.
    If <var class="Fa">l_len</var> is negative, the result is undefined. The
    <var class="Fa">l_pid</var> field is only used with
    <code class="Dv">F_GETLK</code> to return the process ID of the process
    holding a blocking lock. After a successful <code class="Dv">F_GETLK</code>
    request, the value of <var class="Fa">l_whence</var> is
    <code class="Dv">SEEK_SET</code>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Locks may start and extend beyond the current end of a file, but
    may not start or extend before the beginning of the file. A lock is set to
    extend to the largest possible value of the file offset for that file if
    <var class="Fa">l_len</var> is set to zero. If
    <var class="Fa">l_whence</var> and <var class="Fa">l_start</var> point to
    the beginning of the file, and <var class="Fa">l_len</var> is zero, the
    entire file is locked. If an application wishes only to do entire file
    locking, the <a class="Xr">flock(2)</a> system call is much more
  efficient.</p>
<p class="Pp">There is at most one type of lock set for each byte in the file.
    Before a successful return from an <code class="Dv">F_SETLK</code> or an
    <code class="Dv">F_SETLKW</code> request when the calling process has
    previously existing locks on bytes in the region specified by the request,
    the previous lock type for each byte in the specified region is replaced by
    the new lock type. As specified above under the descriptions of shared locks
    and exclusive locks, an <code class="Dv">F_SETLK</code> or an
    <code class="Dv">F_SETLKW</code> request fails or blocks respectively when
    another process has existing locks on bytes in the specified region and the
    type of any of those locks conflicts with the type specified in the
  request.</p>
<p class="Pp">This interface follows the completely stupid semantics of System V
    and <span class="St">IEEE Std 1003.1-1988 (&#x201C;POSIX.1&#x201D;)</span>
    that require that all locks associated with a file for a given process are
    removed when <i>any</i> file descriptor for that file is closed by that
    process. This semantic means that applications must be aware of any files
    that a subroutine library may access. For example if an application for
    updating the password file locks the password file database while making the
    update, and then calls <a class="Xr">getpwname(3)</a> to retrieve a record,
    the lock will be lost because <a class="Xr">getpwname(3)</a> opens, reads,
    and closes the password database. The database close will release all locks
    that the process has associated with the database, even if the library
    routine never requested a lock on the database. Another minor semantic
    problem with this interface is that locks are not inherited by a child
    process created using the <a class="Xr">fork(2)</a> function. The
    <a class="Xr">flock(2)</a> interface has much more rational last close
    semantics and allows locks to be inherited by child processes.
    <a class="Xr">Flock(2)</a> is recommended for applications that want to
    ensure the integrity of their locks when using library routines or wish to
    pass locks to their children. Note that <a class="Xr">flock(2)</a> and
    <code class="Nm">fcntl</code> locks may be safely used concurrently.</p>
<p class="Pp">All locks associated with a file for a given process are removed
    when the process terminates.</p>
<p class="Pp">A potential for deadlock occurs if a process controlling a locked
    region is put to sleep by attempting to lock the locked region of another
    process. This implementation detects that sleeping until a locked region is
    unlocked would cause a deadlock and fails with an
    <code class="Er">EDEADLK</code> error.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <code class="Dv">F_PREALLOCATE</code> command operates on the
    following structure:</p>
<div class="Bd Pp Li">
<pre>        typedef struct fstore {
	    u_int32_t fst_flags;      /* IN: flags word */
	    int       fst_posmode;    /* IN: indicates offset field */
	    off_t     fst_offset;     /* IN: start of the region */
	    off_t     fst_length;     /* IN: size of the region */
