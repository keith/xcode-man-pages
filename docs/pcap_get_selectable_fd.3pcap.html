<p class="Pp"><b>pcap_get_selectable_fd()</b> returns, on UNIX, a file
    descriptor number for a file descriptor on which one can do a
    <b>select(2)</b>, <b>poll(2)</b>, <b>epoll_wait(2)</b>, <b>kevent()</b>, or
    other such call to wait for it to be possible to read packets without
    blocking, if such a descriptor exists, or <b>PCAP_ERROR</b>, if no such
    descriptor exists.</p>
<p class="Pp">Some network devices opened with <b>pcap_create(3PCAP)</b> and
    <b>pcap_activate(3PCAP)</b>, or with <b>pcap_open_live(3PCAP)</b>, do not
    support those calls (for example, regular network devices on FreeBSD 4.3 and
    4.4, and Endace DAG devices), so <b>PCAP_ERROR</b> is returned for those
    devices. In that case, those calls must be given a timeout less than or
    equal to the timeout returned by
    <b>pcap_get_required_select_timeout(3PCAP)</b> for the device for which
    <b>pcap_get_selectable_fd()</b> returned <b>PCAP_ERROR</b>, the device must
    be put in non-blocking mode with a call to <b>pcap_setnonblock(3PCAP)</b>,
    and an attempt must always be made to read packets from the device when the
    call returns. If <b>pcap_get_required_select_timeout()</b> returns
    <b>NULL</b>, it is not possible to wait for packets to arrive on the device
    in an event loop.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that a device on which a read can be done without blocking
    may, on some platforms, not have any packets to read if the packet buffer
    timeout has expired. A call to <b>pcap_dispatch(3PCAP)</b> or
    <b>pcap_next_ex(3PCAP)</b> will return 0 in this case, but will not
  block.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that in:</p>

<p class="Pp"><b>select()</b>, <b>poll()</b>, and <b>kevent()</b> do not work
    correctly on BPF devices; <b>pcap_get_selectable_fd()</b> will return a file
    descriptor on most of those versions (the exceptions being FreeBSD 4.3 and
    4.4), but a simple <b>select()</b>, <b>poll()</b>, or <b>kevent()</b> call
    will not indicate that the descriptor is readable until a full buffer's
    worth of packets is received, even if the packet timeout expires before
    then. To work around this, code that uses those calls to wait for packets to
    arrive must put the <b>pcap_t</b> in non-blocking mode, and must arrange
    that the call have a timeout less than or equal to the packet buffer
    timeout, and must try to read packets after that timeout expires, regardless
    of whether the call indicated that the file descriptor for the <b>pcap_t</b>
    is ready to be read or not. (That workaround will not work in FreeBSD 4.3
    and later; however, in FreeBSD 4.6 and later, those calls work correctly on
    BPF devices, so the workaround isn't necessary, although it does no
  harm.)</p>
<p class="Pp">Note also that <b>poll()</b> and <b>kevent()</b> doesn't work on
    character special files, including BPF devices, in Mac OS X 10.4 and 10.5,
    so, while <b>select()</b> can be used on the descriptor returned by
    <b>pcap_get_selectable_fd()</b>, <b>poll()</b> and <b>kevent()</b> cannot be
    used on it those versions of Mac OS X. <b>poll()</b>, but not
    <b>kevent()</b>, works on that descriptor in Mac OS X releases prior to
    10.4; <b>poll()</b> and <b>kevent()</b> work on that descriptor in Mac OS X
    10.6 and later.</p>
