  isn't really a Unicode tutorial, is it?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">No, and this isn't really a Unicode FAQ.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl has an abstracted interface for all supported character
    encodings, so this is actually a generic
    <span class="Li">&quot;Encode&quot;</span> tutorial and
    <span class="Li">&quot;Encode&quot;</span> FAQ. But many people think that
    Unicode is special and magical, and I didn't want to disappoint them, so I
    decided to call the document a Unicode tutorial.</p>

<p class="Pp">To find out which character encodings your Perl supports, run:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    perl -MEncode -le &quot;print for Encode-&gt;encodings(':all')&quot;
</pre>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Which_version_of_perl_should_I_use?"><a class="permalink" href="#Which_version_of_perl_should_I_use?">Which
  version of perl should I use?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Well, if you can, upgrade to the most recent, but certainly
    <span class="Li">5.8.1</span> or newer. The tutorial and FAQ assume the
    latest release.</p>
<p class="Pp">You should also check your modules, and upgrade them if necessary.
    For example, HTML::Entities requires version &gt;= 1.32 to function
    correctly, even though the changelog is silent about this.</p>

<p class="Pp">Well, apart from a bare <span class="Li">&quot;binmode
    $fh&quot;</span>, you shouldn't treat them specially. (The binmode is needed
    because otherwise Perl may convert line endings on Win32 systems.)</p>
<p class="Pp">Be careful, though, to never combine text strings with binary
    strings. If you need text in a binary stream, encode your text strings first
    using the appropriate encoding, then join them with binary strings. See
    also: &quot;What if I don't encode?&quot;.</p>

<p class="Pp">Whenever you're communicating text with anything that is external
    to your perl process, like a database, a text file, a socket, or another
    program. Even if the thing you're communicating with is also written in
    Perl.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="What_if_I_don't_decode?"><a class="permalink" href="#What_if_I_don't_decode?">What
  if I don't decode?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Whenever your encoded, binary string is used together with a text
    string, Perl will assume that your binary string was encoded with
    ISO-8859-1, also known as latin-1. If it wasn't latin-1, then your data is
    unpleasantly converted. For example, if it was UTF-8, the individual bytes
    of multibyte characters are seen as separate characters, and then again
    converted to UTF-8. Such double encoding can be compared to double HTML
    encoding (<span class="Li">&quot;&amp;amp;gt;&quot;</span>), or double URI
    encoding (<span class="Li">%253E</span>).</p>
<p class="Pp">This silent implicit decoding is known as &quot;upgrading&quot;.
    That may sound positive, but it's best to avoid it.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="What_if_I_don't_encode?"><a class="permalink" href="#What_if_I_don't_encode?">What
  if I don't encode?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Your text string will be sent using the bytes in Perl's internal
    format. In some cases, Perl will warn you that you're doing something wrong,
    with a friendly warning:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    Wide character in print at example.pl line 2.
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Because the internal format is often UTF-8, these bugs are hard to
    spot, because UTF-8 is usually the encoding you wanted! But don't be lazy,
    and don't use the fact that Perl's internal format is UTF-8 to your
    advantage. Encode explicitly to avoid weird bugs, and to show to maintenance
    programmers that you thought this through.</p>

  there a way to automatically decode or encode?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">If all data that comes from a certain handle is encoded in exactly
    the same way, you can tell the PerlIO system to automatically decode
    everything, with the <span class="Li">&quot;encoding&quot;</span> layer. If
    you do this, you can't accidentally forget to decode or encode anymore, on
    things that use the layered handle.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can provide this layer when
    <span class="Li">&quot;open&quot;</span>ing the file:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  open my $fh, '&gt;:encoding(UTF-8)', $filename;  # auto encoding on write
  open my $fh, '&lt;:encoding(UTF-8)', $filename;  # auto decoding on read
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Or if you already have an open filehandle:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  binmode $fh, ':encoding(UTF-8)';
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Some database drivers for DBI can also automatically encode and
    decode, but that is sometimes limited to the UTF-8 encoding.</p>

<p class="Pp">Do whatever you can to find out, and if you have to: guess. (Don't
    forget to document your guess with a comment.)</p>
<p class="Pp">You could open the document in a web browser, and change the
    character set or character encoding until you can visually confirm that all
    characters look the way they should.</p>
<p class="Pp">There is no way to reliably detect the encoding automatically, so
    if people keep sending you data without charset indication, you may have to
    educate them.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Can_I_use_Unicode_in_my_Perl_sources?"><a class="permalink" href="#Can_I_use_Unicode_in_my_Perl_sources?">Can
  I use Unicode in my Perl sources?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Yes, you can! If your sources are UTF-8 encoded, you can indicate
    that with the <span class="Li">&quot;use utf8&quot;</span> pragma.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    use utf8;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This doesn't do anything to your input, or to your output. It only
    influences the way your sources are read. You can use Unicode in string
    literals, in identifiers (but they still have to be &quot;word
    characters&quot; according to <span class="Li">&quot;\w&quot;</span>), and
    even in custom delimiters.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Data::Dumper_doesn't_restore_the_"><a class="permalink" href="#Data::Dumper_doesn't_restore_the_">Data::Dumper
  doesn't restore the UTF8 flag; is it broken?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">No, Data::Dumper's Unicode abilities are as they should be. There
    have been some complaints that it should restore the UTF8 flag when the data
    is read again with <span class="Li">&quot;eval&quot;</span>. However, you
    should really not look at the flag, and nothing indicates that Data::Dumper
    should break this rule.</p>
<p class="Pp">Here's what happens: when Perl reads in a string literal, it
    sticks to 8 bit encoding as long as it can. (But perhaps originally it was
    internally encoded as UTF-8, when you dumped it.) When it has to give that
    up because other characters are added to the text string, it silently
    upgrades the string to UTF-8. </p>
<p class="Pp">If you properly encode your strings for output, none of this is of
    your concern, and you can just <span class="Li">&quot;eval&quot;</span>
    dumped data as always.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Why_do_some_characters_not_uppercase_or_lowercase_correctly?"><a class="permalink" href="#Why_do_some_characters_not_uppercase_or_lowercase_correctly?">Why
  do some characters not uppercase or lowercase correctly?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Starting in Perl 5.14 (and partially in Perl 5.12), just put a
    <span class="Li">&quot;use feature 'unicode_strings'&quot;</span> near the
    beginning of your program. Within its lexical scope you shouldn't have this
    problem. It also is automatically enabled under <span class="Li">&quot;use
    feature ':5.12'&quot;</span> or <span class="Li">&quot;use
    v5.12&quot;</span> or using <span class="Li">&quot;-E&quot;</span> on the
    command line for Perl 5.12 or higher.</p>
<p class="Pp">The rationale for requiring this is to not break older programs
    that rely on the way things worked before Unicode came along. Those older
    programs knew only about the ASCII character set, and so may not work
    properly for additional characters. When a string is encoded in UTF-8, Perl
    assumes that the program is prepared to deal with Unicode, but when the
    string isn't, Perl assumes that only ASCII is wanted, and so those
    characters that are not ASCII characters aren't recognized as to what they
    would be in Unicode. <span class="Li">&quot;use feature
    'unicode_strings'&quot;</span> tells Perl to treat all characters as
    Unicode, whether the string is encoded in UTF-8 or not, thus avoiding the
    problem.</p>
<p class="Pp">However, on earlier Perls, or if you pass strings to subroutines
    outside the feature's scope, you can force Unicode semantics by changing the
    encoding to UTF-8 by doing
    <span class="Li">&quot;utf8::upgrade($string)&quot;</span>. This can be used
    safely on any string, as it checks and does not change strings that have
    already been upgraded.</p>
<p class="Pp">For a more detailed discussion, see Unicode::Semantics on
  CPAN.</p>

  can I determine if a string is a text string or a binary string?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">You can't. Some use the UTF8 flag for this, but that's misuse, and
    makes well behaved modules like Data::Dumper look bad. The flag is useless
    for this purpose, because it's off when an 8 bit encoding (by default
    ISO-8859-1) is used to store the string.</p>
<p class="Pp">This is something you, the programmer, has to keep track of;

<pre>    my $text_string = decode('FOO', $foo_string);

<p class="Pp">This is a term used both for characters with an ordinal value
    greater than 127, characters with an ordinal value greater than 255, or any
    character occupying more than one byte, depending on the context.</p>
<p class="Pp">The Perl warning &quot;Wide character in ...&quot; is caused by a
    character with an ordinal value greater than 255. With no specified encoding
    layer, Perl tries to fit things in ISO-8859-1 for backward compatibility
    reasons. When it can't, it emits this warning (if warnings are enabled), and
    outputs UTF-8 encoded data instead.</p>
<p class="Pp">To avoid this warning and to avoid having different output
    encodings in a single stream, always specify an encoding explicitly, for

<h2 class="Ss" id="What_is__the_"><a class="permalink" href="#What_is__the_">What
  is &quot;the UTF8 flag&quot;?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Please, unless you're hacking the internals, or debugging
    weirdness, don't think about the UTF8 flag at all. That means that you very
    probably shouldn't use <span class="Li">&quot;is_utf8&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;_utf8_on&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;_utf8_off&quot;</span> at all.</p>
<p class="Pp">The UTF8 flag, also called SvUTF8, is an internal flag that
    indicates that the current internal representation is UTF-8. Without the
    flag, it is assumed to be ISO-8859-1. Perl converts between these
    automatically. (Actually Perl usually assumes the representation is ASCII;
    see &quot;Why do regex character classes sometimes match only in the ASCII
    range?&quot; above.)</p>
<p class="Pp">One of Perl's internal formats happens to be UTF-8. Unfortunately,
    Perl can't keep a secret, so everyone knows about this. That is the source
    of much confusion. It's better to pretend that the internal format is some
    unknown encoding, and that you always have to encode and decode
  explicitly.</p>

<p class="Pp">Don't use it. It makes no sense to deal with bytes in a text
    string, and it makes no sense to deal with characters in a byte string. Do
    the proper conversions (by decoding/encoding), and things will work out
    well: you get character counts for decoded data, and byte counts for encoded
    data.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;use bytes&quot;</span> is usually a failed

  about the &quot;use encoding&quot; pragma?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Don't use it. Unfortunately, it assumes that the programmer's
    environment and that of the user will use the same encoding. It will use the
    same encoding for the source code and for STDIN and STDOUT. When a program
    is copied to another machine, the source code does not change, but the STDIO
    environment might.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you need non-ASCII characters in your source code, make it a

  &quot;:utf8&quot;?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Because UTF-8 is one of Perl's internal formats, you can often
    just skip the encoding or decoding step, and manipulate the UTF8 flag
    directly.</p>
<p class="Pp">Instead of <span class="Li">&quot;:encoding(UTF-8)&quot;</span>,
    you can simply use <span class="Li">&quot;:utf8&quot;</span>, which skips
    the encoding step if the data was already represented as UTF8 internally.
    This is widely accepted as good behavior when you're writing, but it can be
    dangerous when reading, because it causes internal inconsistency when you
    have invalid byte sequences. Using <span class="Li">&quot;:utf8&quot;</span>
    for input can sometimes result in security breaches, so please use
    <span class="Li">&quot;:encoding(UTF-8)&quot;</span> instead.</p>
<p class="Pp">Instead of <span class="Li">&quot;decode&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;encode&quot;</span>, you could use
    <span class="Li">&quot;_utf8_on&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;_utf8_off&quot;</span>, but this is considered bad
    style. Especially <span class="Li">&quot;_utf8_on&quot;</span> can be
    dangerous, for the same reason that

  the difference between &quot;UTF-8&quot; and &quot;utf8&quot;?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;UTF-8&quot;</span> is the official
    standard. <span class="Li">&quot;utf8&quot;</span> is Perl's way of being
    liberal in what it accepts. If you have to communicate with things that
    aren't so liberal, you may want to consider using
    <span class="Li">&quot;UTF-8&quot;</span>. If you have to communicate with
    things that are too liberal, you may have to use
    <span class="Li">&quot;utf8&quot;</span>. The full explanation is in
  Encode.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;UTF-8&quot;</span> is internally known as
    <span class="Li">&quot;utf-8-strict&quot;</span>. The tutorial uses UTF-8
    consistently, even where utf8 is actually used internally, because the
    distinction can be hard to make, and is mostly irrelevant.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, utf8 can be used for code points that don't exist in
    Unicode, like 9999999, but if you encode that to UTF-8, you get a
    substitution character (by default; see &quot;Handling Malformed Data&quot;
    in Encode for more ways of dealing with this.)</p>
<p class="Pp">Okay, if you insist: the &quot;internal format&quot; is utf8, not
    UTF-8. (When it's not some other encoding.)</p>

  lost track; what encoding is the internal format really?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">It's good that you lost track, because you shouldn't depend on the
    internal format being any specific encoding. But since you asked: by
    default, the internal format is either ISO-8859-1 (latin-1), or utf8,
    depending on the history of the string. On EBCDIC platforms, this may be
    different even.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl knows how it stored the string internally, and will use that
    knowledge when you <span class="Li">&quot;encode&quot;</span>. In other
    words: don't try to find out what the internal encoding for a certain string
    is, but instead just encode it into the encoding that you want.</p>
