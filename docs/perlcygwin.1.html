<p class="Pp">This document will help you configure, make, test and install Perl
    on Cygwin. This document also describes features of Cygwin that will affect
    how Perl behaves at runtime.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>NOTE:</b> There are pre-built Perl packages available for
    Cygwin and a version of Perl is provided in the normal Cygwin install. If
    you do not need to customize the configuration, consider using one of those
    packages.</p>

<p class="Pp">The Cygwin tools are ports of the popular GNU development tools
    for Win32 platforms. They run thanks to the Cygwin library which provides
    the UNIX system calls and environment these programs expect. More
    information about this project can be found at:</p>
<p class="Pp">&lt;http://www.cygwin.com/&gt;</p>
<p class="Pp">A recent net or commercial release of Cygwin is required.</p>

  Configuration</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">While building Perl some changes may be necessary to your Cygwin
    setup so that Perl builds cleanly. These changes are <b>not</b> required for
    normal Perl usage.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>NOTE:</b> The binaries that are built will run on all Win32
    versions. They do not depend on your host system (WinXP/Win2K/Win7) or your
    Cygwin configuration (binary/text mounts, cvgserver). The only dependencies
    come from hard-coded pathnames like <i>/usr/local</i>. However, your host
    system and Cygwin configuration will affect Perl's runtime behavior (see
    &quot;TEST&quot;).</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;PATH&quot;</span>
    <p class="Pp">Set the <span class="Li">&quot;PATH&quot;</span> environment
        variable so that Configure finds the Cygwin versions of programs. Any
        not-needed Windows directories should be removed or moved to the end of
        your <span class="Li">&quot;PATH&quot;</span>.</p>
  </li>
  <li><i>nroff</i>
    <p class="Pp">If you do not have <i>nroff</i> (which is part of the
        <i>groff</i> package), Configure will <b>not</b> prompt you to install
        <i>man</i> pages.</p>

<p class="Pp">The default options gathered by Configure with the assistance of
    <i>hints/cygwin.sh</i> will build a Perl that supports dynamic loading
    (which requires a shared <i>cygperl5_16.dll</i>).</p>
<p class="Pp">This will run Configure and keep a record:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  ./Configure 2&gt;&amp;1 | tee log.configure

<p class="Pp">It is possible to strip the EXEs and DLLs created by the build
    process. The resulting binaries will be significantly smaller. If you want
    the binaries to be stripped, you can either add a <b>-s</b> option when
    Configure prompts you,</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  Any additional ld flags (NOT including libraries)? [none] -s
  Any special flags to pass to g++ to create a dynamically loaded

  Libraries for Perl on Cygwin</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Several Perl functions and modules depend on the existence of some
    optional libraries. Configure will find them if they are installed in one of
    the directories listed as being used for library searches. Pre-built
    packages for most of these are available from the Cygwin installer.</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;-lcrypt&quot;</span>
    <p class="Pp">The crypt package distributed with Cygwin is a Linux
        compatible 56-bit DES crypt port by Corinna Vinschen.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Alternatively, the crypt libraries in GNU libc have been
        ported to Cygwin.</p>
    <p class="Pp">As of libcrypt 1.3 (March 2016), you will need to install the
        libcrypt-devel package for Configure to detect <b>crypt()</b>.</p>

  </li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;cygserver&quot;</span> (<span class="Li">&quot;use
      IPC::SysV&quot;</span>)
    <p class="Pp">A port of SysV IPC is available for Cygwin.</p>
    <p class="Pp">NOTE: This has <b>not</b> been extensively tested. In
        particular, <span class="Li">&quot;d_semctl_semun&quot;</span> is
        undefined because it fails a Configure test and on Win9x the
        <i>shm*()</i> functions seem to hang. It also creates a compile time
        dependency because <i>perl.h</i> includes <i>&lt;sys/ipc.h</i>&gt; and
        <i>&lt;sys/sem.h</i>&gt; (which will be required in the future when
        compiling CPAN modules). CURRENTLY NOT SUPPORTED!</p>
  </li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;-lutil&quot;</span>

  Options for Perl on Cygwin</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The <i>INSTALL</i> document describes several Configure-time
    options. Some of these will work with Cygwin, others are not yet possible.
    Also, some of these are experimental. You can either select an option when
    Configure prompts you or you can define (undefine) symbols on the command
    line.</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;-Uusedl&quot;</span>
    <p class="Pp">Undefining this symbol forces Perl to be compiled
      statically.</p>
  </li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;-Dusemymalloc&quot;</span>
    <p class="Pp">By default Perl does not use the
        <span class="Li">&quot;malloc()&quot;</span> included with the Perl
        source, because it was slower and not entirely thread-safe. If you want
        to force Perl to build with the old -Dusemymalloc define this.</p>
  </li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;-Uuseperlio&quot;</span>
    <p class="Pp">Undefining this symbol disables the PerlIO abstraction. PerlIO
        is now the default; it is not recommended to disable PerlIO.</p>
  </li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;-Dusemultiplicity&quot;</span>
    <p class="Pp">Multiplicity is required when embedding Perl in a C program
        and using more than one interpreter instance. This is only required when
        you build a not-threaded perl with
        <span class="Li">&quot;-Uuseithreads&quot;</span>.</p>
  </li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;-Uuse64bitint&quot;</span>
    <p class="Pp">By default Perl uses 64 bit integers. If you want to use
        smaller 32 bit integers, define this symbol.</p>
  </li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;-Duselongdouble&quot;</span>
    <p class="Pp"><i>gcc</i> supports long doubles (12 bytes). However, several
        additional long double math functions are necessary to use them within
        Perl (<i>{atan2, cos, exp, floor, fmod, frexp, isnan, log, modf, pow,
        sin, sqrt}l,</i> <i>strtold</i>). These are <b>not</b> yet available
        with newlib, the Cygwin libc.</p>
  </li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;-Uuseithreads&quot;</span>
    <p class="Pp">Define this symbol if you want not-threaded faster perl.</p>
  </li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;-Duselargefiles&quot;</span>
    <p class="Pp">Cygwin uses 64-bit integers for internal size and position
        calculations, this will be correctly detected and defined by
      Configure.</p>
  </li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;-Dmksymlinks&quot;</span>
    <p class="Pp">Use this to build perl outside of the source tree. Details can
        be found in the <i>INSTALL</i> document. This is the recommended way to
        build perl from sources.</p>

    <p class="Pp">Win9x does not correctly report

<h2 class="Ss" id="File_Permissions_on_Cygwin"><a class="permalink" href="#File_Permissions_on_Cygwin">File
  Permissions on Cygwin</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">UNIX file permissions are based on sets of mode bits for
    {read,write,execute} for each {user,group,other}. By default Cygwin only
    tracks the Win32 read-only attribute represented as the UNIX file user write
    bit (files are always readable, files are executable if they have a
    <i>.{com,bat,exe}</i> extension or begin with
    <span class="Li">&quot;#!&quot;</span>, directories are always readable and
    executable). On WinNT with the <i>ntea</i>
    <span class="Li">&quot;CYGWIN&quot;</span> setting, the additional mode bits
    are stored as extended file attributes. On WinNT with the default
    <i>ntsec</i> <span class="Li">&quot;CYGWIN&quot;</span> setting, permissions
    use the standard WinNT security descriptors and access control lists.
    Without one of these options, these tests will fail (listing not updated

<h2 class="Ss" id="Script_Portability_on_Cygwin"><a class="permalink" href="#Script_Portability_on_Cygwin">Script
  Portability on Cygwin</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Cygwin does an outstanding job of providing UNIX-like semantics on
    top of Win32 systems. However, in addition to the items noted above, there
    are some differences that you should know about. This is a very brief guide
    to portability, more information can be found in the Cygwin
  documentation.</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Pathnames
    <p class="Pp">Cygwin pathnames are separated by forward (<i>/</i>) slashes,
        Universal Naming Codes (<i>//UNC</i>) are also supported Since
        cygwin-1.7 non-POSIX pathnames are discouraged. Names may contain all
        printable characters.</p>
    <p class="Pp">File names are case insensitive, but case preserving. A
        pathname that contains a backslash or drive letter is a Win32 pathname,
        and not subject to the translations applied to POSIX style pathnames,
        but cygwin will warn you, so better convert them to POSIX.</p>
    <p class="Pp">For conversion we have
        <span class="Li">&quot;Cygwin::win_to_posix_path()&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;Cygwin::posix_to_win_path()&quot;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Since cygwin-1.7 pathnames are UTF-8 encoded.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Text/Binary
    <p class="Pp">Since cygwin-1.7 textmounts are deprecated and strongly
        discouraged.</p>
    <p class="Pp">When a file is opened it is in either text or binary mode. In
        text mode a file is subject to CR/LF/Ctrl-Z translations. With Cygwin,
        the default mode for an <span class="Li">&quot;open()&quot;</span> is
        determined by the mode of the mount that underlies the file. See
        &quot;Cygwin::is_binmount&quot;(). Perl provides a
        <span class="Li">&quot;binmode()&quot;</span> function to set binary
        mode on files that otherwise would be treated as text.
        <span class="Li">&quot;sysopen()&quot;</span> with the
        <span class="Li">&quot;O_TEXT&quot;</span> flag sets text mode on files
        that otherwise would be treated as binary:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    sysopen(FOO, &quot;bar&quot;, O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TEXT)
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;lseek()&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;tell()&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;sysseek()&quot;</span> only work with files
        opened in binary mode.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The text/binary issue is covered at length in the Cygwin
        documentation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>PerlIO
    <p class="Pp">PerlIO overrides the default Cygwin Text/Binary behaviour. A
        file will always be treated as binary, regardless of the mode of the
        mount it lives on, just like it is in UNIX. So CR/LF translation needs
        to be requested in either the <span class="Li">&quot;open()&quot;</span>
        call like this:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>  open(FH, &quot;&gt;:crlf&quot;, &quot;out.txt&quot;);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">which will do conversion from LF to CR/LF on the output, or in
        the environment settings (add this to your .bashrc):</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>  export PERLIO=crlf
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">which will pull in the crlf PerlIO layer which does LF -&gt;
        CRLF conversion on every output generated by perl.</p>
  </li>
  <li><i>.exe</i>
    <p class="Pp">The Cygwin <span class="Li">&quot;stat()&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;lstat()&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;readlink()&quot;</span> functions make the
        <i>.exe</i> extension transparent by looking for <i>foo.exe</i> when you
        ask for <i>foo</i> (unless a <i>foo</i> also exists). Cygwin does not
        require a <i>.exe</i> extension, but <i>gcc</i> adds it automatically
        when building a program. However, when accessing an executable as a
        normal file (e.g., <i>cp</i> in a makefile) the <i>.exe</i> is not
        transparent. The <i>install</i> program included with Cygwin
        automatically appends a <i>.exe</i> when necessary.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Cygwin vs. Windows process ids
    <p class="Pp">Cygwin processes have their own pid, which is different from
        the underlying windows pid. Most posix compliant Proc functions expect
        the cygwin pid, but several Win32::Process functions expect the winpid.
        E.g. <span class="Li">$$</span> is the cygwin pid of
        <i>/usr/bin/perl</i>, which is not the winpid. Use
        <span class="Li">&quot;Cygwin::pid_to_winpid()&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;Cygwin::winpid_to_pid()&quot;</span> to translate
        between them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Cygwin vs. Windows errors
    <p class="Pp">Under Cygwin, $^E is the same as $!. When using Win32 API
        Functions, use <span class="Li">&quot;Win32::GetLastError()&quot;</span>
        to get the last Windows error.</p>
  </li>
  <li>rebase errors on fork or system
    <p class="Pp">Using <span class="Li">&quot;fork()&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;system()&quot;</span> out to another perl after
        loading multiple dlls may result on a DLL baseaddress conflict. The
        internal cygwin error looks like like the following:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre> 0 [main] perl 8916 child_info_fork::abort: data segment start:
 parent (0xC1A000) != child(0xA6A000)
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">or:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre> 183 [main] perl 3588 C:\cygwin\bin\perl.exe: *** fatal error -
 unable to remap C:\cygwin\bin\cygsvn_subr-1-0.dll to same address
 as parent(0x6FB30000) != 0x6FE60000 46 [main] perl 3488 fork: child
 3588 - died waiting for dll loading, errno11
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">See
        &lt;http://cygwin.com/faq/faq-nochunks.html#faq.using.fixing-fork-failures&gt;
        It helps if not too many DLLs are loaded in memory so the available
        address space is larger, e.g. stopping the MS Internet Explorer might
        help.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Use the perlrebase or rebase utilities to resolve the
        conflicting dll addresses. The rebase package is included in the Cygwin
        setup. Use <i>setup.exe</i> from &lt;http://www.cygwin.com/setup.exe&gt;
        to install it.</p>
    <p class="Pp">1. kill all perl processes and run
        <span class="Li">&quot;perlrebase&quot;</span> or</p>
    <p class="Pp">2. kill all cygwin processes and services, start dash from
        cmd.exe and run <span class="Li">&quot;rebaseall&quot;</span>.</p>
  </li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;chown()&quot;</span>
    <p class="Pp">On WinNT <span class="Li">&quot;chown()&quot;</span> can
        change a file's user and group IDs. On Win9x
        <span class="Li">&quot;chown()&quot;</span> is a no-op, although this is
        appropriate since there is no security model.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Miscellaneous
    <p class="Pp">File locking using the
        <span class="Li">&quot;F_GETLK&quot;</span> command to
        <span class="Li">&quot;fcntl()&quot;</span> is a stub that returns
        <span class="Li">&quot;ENOSYS&quot;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Win9x can not <span class="Li">&quot;rename()&quot;</span> an
        open file (although WinNT can).</p>
    <p class="Pp">The Cygwin <span class="Li">&quot;chroot()&quot;</span>
        implementation has holes (it can not restrict file access by native
        Win32 programs).</p>
    <p class="Pp">Inplace editing <span class="Li">&quot;perl -i&quot;</span> of
        files doesn't work without doing a backup of the file being edited
        <span class="Li">&quot;perl -i.bak&quot;</span> because of windowish
        restrictions, therefore Perl adds the suffix
        <span class="Li">&quot;.bak&quot;</span> automatically if you use
        <span class="Li">&quot;perl -i&quot;</span> without specifying a backup
        extension.</p>
