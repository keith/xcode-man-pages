<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Runs a number of housekeeping tasks within the current repository,
    such as compressing file revisions (to reduce disk space and increase
    performance), removing unreachable objects which may have been created from
    prior invocations of <i>git add</i>, packing refs, pruning reflog, rerere
    metadata or stale working trees. May also update ancillary indexes such as
    the commit-graph.</p>
<p class="Pp">When common porcelain operations that create objects are run, they
    will check whether the repository has grown substantially since the last
    maintenance, and if so run <b>git</b> <b>gc</b> automatically. See
    <b>gc.auto</b> below for how to disable this behavior.</p>
<p class="Pp">Running <b>git</b> <b>gc</b> manually should only be needed when
    adding objects to a repository without regularly running such porcelain
    commands, to do a one-off repository optimization, or e.g. to clean up a
    suboptimal mass-import. See the &quot;PACKFILE OPTIMIZATION&quot; section in
    <b>git-fast-import</b>(1) for more details on the import case.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">--aggressive</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Usually <i>git gc</i> runs very quickly while providing
  good disk space utilization and performance. This option will cause <i>git
  gc</i> to more aggressively optimize the repository at the expense of taking
  much more time. The effects of this optimization are mostly persistent. See
  the &quot;AGGRESSIVE&quot; section below for details.</div>
<p class="Pp">--auto</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">With this option, <i>git gc</i> checks whether any
  housekeeping is required; if not, it exits without performing any work.
<p class="Pp">See the <b>gc.auto</b> option in the &quot;CONFIGURATION&quot;
    section below for how this heuristic works.</p>
<p class="Pp">Once housekeeping is triggered by exceeding the limits of
    configuration options such as <b>gc.auto</b> and <b>gc.autoPackLimit</b>,
    all other housekeeping tasks (e.g. rerere, working trees, reflog...) will be
    performed as well.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--[no-]detach</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Run in the background if the system supports it. This
  option overrides the <b>gc.autoDetach</b> config.</div>
<p class="Pp">--[no-]cruft</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When expiring unreachable objects, pack them separately
  into a cruft pack instead of storing them as loose objects. <b>--cruft</b> is
  on by default.</div>
<p class="Pp">--max-cruft-size=&lt;n&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When packing unreachable objects into a cruft pack, limit
  the size of new cruft packs to be at most <i>&lt;n&gt;</i> bytes. Overrides
  any value specified via the <b>gc.maxCruftSize</b> configuration. See the
  <b>--max-cruft-size</b> option of <b>git-repack</b>(1) for more.</div>
<p class="Pp">--expire-to=&lt;dir&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When packing unreachable objects into a cruft pack, write
  a cruft pack containing pruned objects (if any) to the directory
  <i>&lt;dir&gt;</i>. This option only has an effect when used together with
  <b>--cruft</b>. See the <b>--expire-to</b> option of <b>git-repack</b>(1) for
  more information.</div>
<p class="Pp">--prune=&lt;date&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Prune loose objects older than date (default is 2 weeks
  ago, overridable by the config variable <b>gc.pruneExpire</b>). --prune=now
  prunes loose objects regardless of their age and increases the risk of
  corruption if another process is writing to the repository concurrently; see
  &quot;NOTES&quot; below. --prune is on by default.</div>
<p class="Pp">--no-prune</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Do not prune any loose objects.</div>
<p class="Pp">--quiet</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Suppress all progress reports.</div>
<p class="Pp">--force</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Force <b>git</b> <b>gc</b> to run even if there may be
  another <b>git</b> <b>gc</b> instance running on this repository.</div>
<p class="Pp">--keep-largest-pack</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">All packs except the largest non-cruft pack, any packs
  marked with a .<b>keep</b> file, and any cruft pack(s) are consolidated into a
  single pack. When this option is used, <b>gc.bigPackThreshold</b> is
  ignored.</div>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="AGGRESSIVE"><a class="permalink" href="#AGGRESSIVE">AGGRESSIVE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">When the <b>--aggressive</b> option is supplied,
    <b>git-repack</b>(1) will be invoked with the <b>-f</b> flag, which in turn
    will pass <b>--no-reuse-delta</b> to <b>git-pack-objects</b>(1). This will
    throw away any existing deltas and re-compute them, at the expense of
    spending much more time on the repacking.</p>
<p class="Pp">The effects of this are mostly persistent, e.g. when packs and
    loose objects are coalesced into one another pack the existing deltas in
    that pack might get re-used, but there are also various cases where we might
    pick a sub-optimal delta from a newer pack instead.</p>
<p class="Pp">Furthermore, supplying <b>--aggressive</b> will tweak the
    <b>--depth</b> and <b>--window</b> options passed to <b>git-repack</b>(1).
    See the <b>gc.aggressiveDepth</b> and <b>gc.aggressiveWindow</b> settings
    below. By using a larger window size we&#x2019;re more likely to find more
    optimal deltas.</p>
<p class="Pp">It&#x2019;s probably not worth it to use this option on a given
    repository without running tailored performance benchmarks on it. It takes a
    lot more time, and the resulting space/delta optimization may or may not be
    worth it. Not using this at all is the right trade-off for most users and
    their repositories.</p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="CONFIGURATION"><a class="permalink" href="#CONFIGURATION">CONFIGURATION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Everything below this line in this section is selectively included
    from the <b>git-config</b>(1) documentation. The content is the same as
    what&#x2019;s found there:</p>
<p class="Pp">gc.aggressiveDepth</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The depth parameter used in the delta compression
  algorithm used by <i>git gc --aggressive</i>. This defaults to 50, which is
  the default for the <b>--depth</b> option when <b>--aggressive</b>
  isn&#x2019;t in use.
<p class="Pp">See the documentation for the <b>--depth</b> option in
    <b>git-repack</b>(1) for more details.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">gc.aggressiveWindow</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The window size parameter used in the delta compression
  algorithm used by <i>git gc --aggressive</i>. This defaults to 250, which is a
  much more aggressive window size than the default <b>--window</b> of 10.
<p class="Pp">See the documentation for the <b>--window</b> option in
    <b>git-repack</b>(1) for more details.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">gc.auto</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When there are approximately more than this many loose
  objects in the repository, <b>git</b> <b>gc</b> <b>--auto</b> will pack them.
  Some Porcelain commands use this command to perform a light-weight garbage
  collection from time to time. The default value is 6700.
<p class="Pp">Setting this to 0 disables not only automatic packing based on the
    number of loose objects, but also any other heuristic <b>git</b> <b>gc</b>
    <b>--auto</b> will otherwise use to determine if there&#x2019;s work to do,
    such as <b>gc.autoPackLimit</b>.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">gc.autoPackLimit</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When there are more than this many packs that are not
  marked with <b>*.keep</b> file in the repository, <b>git</b> <b>gc</b>
  <b>--auto</b> consolidates them into one larger pack. The default value is 50.
  Setting this to 0 disables it. Setting <b>gc.auto</b> to 0 will also disable
  this.
<p class="Pp">See the <b>gc.bigPackThreshold</b> configuration variable below.
    When in use, it&#x2019;ll affect how the auto pack limit works.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">gc.autoDetach</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Make <b>git</b> <b>gc</b> <b>--auto</b> return
  immediately and run in the background if the system supports it. Default is
  true. This config variable acts as a fallback in case
  <b>maintenance.autoDetach</b> is not set.</div>
<p class="Pp">gc.bigPackThreshold</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If non-zero, all non-cruft packs larger than this limit
  are kept when <b>git</b> <b>gc</b> is run. This is very similar to
  <b>--keep-largest-pack</b> except that all non-cruft packs that meet the
  threshold are kept, not just the largest pack. Defaults to zero. Common unit
  suffixes of <i>k</i>, <i>m</i>, or <i>g</i> are supported.
<p class="Pp">Note that if the number of kept packs is more than
    gc.autoPackLimit, this configuration variable is ignored, all packs except
    the base pack will be repacked. After this the number of packs should go
    below gc.autoPackLimit and gc.bigPackThreshold should be respected
  again.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the amount of memory estimated for <b>git</b> <b>repack</b> to
    run smoothly is not available and <b>gc.bigPackThreshold</b> is not set, the
    largest pack will also be excluded (this is the equivalent of running
    <b>git</b> <b>gc</b> with <b>--keep-largest-pack</b>).</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">gc.writeCommitGraph</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If true, then gc will rewrite the commit-graph file when
  <b>git-gc</b>(1) is run. When using <b>git</b> <b>gc</b> <b>--auto</b> the
  commit-graph will be updated if housekeeping is required. Default is true. See
  <b>git-commit-graph</b>(1) for details.</div>
<p class="Pp">gc.logExpiry</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If the file gc.log exists, then <b>git</b> <b>gc</b>
  <b>--auto</b> will print its content and exit with status zero instead of
  running unless that file is more than <i>gc.logExpiry</i> old. Default is
  &quot;1.day&quot;. See <b>gc.pruneExpire</b> for more ways to specify its
  value.</div>
<p class="Pp">gc.packRefs</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Running <b>git</b> <b>pack-refs</b> in a repository
  renders it unclonable by Git versions prior to 1.5.1.2 over dumb transports
  such as HTTP. This variable determines whether <i>git gc</i> runs <b>git</b>
  <b>pack-refs</b>. This can be set to <b>notbare</b> to enable it within all
  non-bare repos or it can be set to a boolean value. The default is
  <b>true</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">gc.cruftPacks</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Store unreachable objects in a cruft pack (see
  <b>git-repack</b>(1)) instead of as loose objects. The default is
  <b>true</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">gc.maxCruftSize</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Limit the size of new cruft packs when repacking. When
  specified in addition to <b>--max-cruft-size</b>, the command line option
  takes priority. See the <b>--max-cruft-size</b> option of
  <b>git-repack</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">gc.pruneExpire</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When <i>git gc</i> is run, it will call <i>prune --expire
  2.weeks.ago</i> (and <i>repack --cruft --cruft-expiration 2.weeks.ago</i> if
  using cruft packs via <b>gc.cruftPacks</b> or <b>--cruft</b>). Override the
  grace period with this config variable. The value &quot;now&quot; may be used
  to disable this grace period and always prune unreachable objects immediately,
  or &quot;never&quot; may be used to suppress pruning. This feature helps
  prevent corruption when <i>git gc</i> runs concurrently with another process
  writing to the repository; see the &quot;NOTES&quot; section of
  <b>git-gc</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">gc.worktreePruneExpire</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When <i>git gc</i> is run, it calls <i>git worktree prune
  --expire 3.months.ago</i>. This config variable can be used to set a different
  grace period. The value &quot;now&quot; may be used to disable the grace
  period and prune <b>$GIT_DIR/worktrees</b> immediately, or &quot;never&quot;
  may be used to suppress pruning.</div>
<p class="Pp">gc.reflogExpire, gc.&lt;pattern&gt;.reflogExpire</p>
<div class="Bd-indent"><i>git reflog expire</i> removes reflog entries older
  than this time; defaults to 90 days. The value &quot;now&quot; expires all
  entries immediately, and &quot;never&quot; suppresses expiration altogether.
  With &quot;&lt;pattern&gt;&quot; (e.g. &quot;refs/stash&quot;) in the middle
  the setting applies only to the refs that match the &lt;pattern&gt;.</div>
<p class="Pp">gc.reflogExpireUnreachable,
    gc.&lt;pattern&gt;.reflogExpireUnreachable</p>
<div class="Bd-indent"><i>git reflog expire</i> removes reflog entries older
  than this time and are not reachable from the current tip; defaults to 30
  days. The value &quot;now&quot; expires all entries immediately, and
  &quot;never&quot; suppresses expiration altogether. With
  &quot;&lt;pattern&gt;&quot; (e.g. &quot;refs/stash&quot;) in the middle, the
  setting applies only to the refs that match the &lt;pattern&gt;.
<p class="Pp">These types of entries are generally created as a result of using
    <b>git</b> <b>commit</b> <b>--amend</b> or <b>git</b> <b>rebase</b> and are
    the commits prior to the amend or rebase occurring. Since these changes are
    not part of the current project most users will want to expire them sooner,
    which is why the default is more aggressive than <b>gc.reflogExpire</b>.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">gc.recentObjectsHook</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When considering whether or not to remove an object
  (either when generating a cruft pack or storing unreachable objects as loose),
  use the shell to execute the specified command(s). Interpret their output as
  object IDs which Git will consider as &quot;recent&quot;, regardless of their
  age. By treating their mtimes as &quot;now&quot;, any objects (and their
  descendants) mentioned in the output will be kept regardless of their true
  age.
<p class="Pp">Output must contain exactly one hex object ID per line, and
    nothing else. Objects which cannot be found in the repository are ignored.
    Multiple hooks are supported, but all must exit successfully, else the
    operation (either generating a cruft pack or unpacking unreachable objects)
    will be halted.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">gc.repackFilter</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When repacking, use the specified filter to move certain
  objects into a separate packfile. See the
  <b>--filter=</b><i>&lt;filter-spec&gt;</i> option of
  <b>git-repack</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">gc.repackFilterTo</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When repacking and using a filter, see
  <b>gc.repackFilter</b>, the specified location will be used to create the
  packfile containing the filtered out objects. <b>WARNING:</b> The specified
  location should be accessible, using for example the Git alternates mechanism,
  otherwise the repo could be considered corrupt by Git as it might not be able
  to access the objects in that packfile. See the
  <b>--filter-to=</b><i>&lt;dir&gt;</i> option of <b>git-repack</b>(1) and the
  <b>objects/info/alternates</b> section of
  <b>gitrepository-layout</b>(5).</div>
<p class="Pp">gc.rerereResolved</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Records of conflicted merge you resolved earlier are kept
  for this many days when <i>git rerere gc</i> is run. You can also use more
  human-readable &quot;1.month.ago&quot;, etc. The default is 60 days. See
  <b>git-rerere</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">gc.rerereUnresolved</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Records of conflicted merge you have not resolved are
  kept for this many days when <i>git rerere gc</i> is run. You can also use
  more human-readable &quot;1.month.ago&quot;, etc. The default is 15 days. See
  <b>git-rerere</b>(1).</div>

<h1 class="Sh" id="NOTES"><a class="permalink" href="#NOTES">NOTES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp"><i>git gc</i> tries very hard not to delete objects that are
    referenced anywhere in your repository. In particular, it will keep not only
    objects referenced by your current set of branches and tags, but also
    objects referenced by the index, remote-tracking branches, reflogs (which
    may reference commits in branches that were later amended or rewound), and
    anything else in the refs/* namespace. Note that a note (of the kind created
    by <i>git notes</i>) attached to an object does not contribute in keeping
    the object alive. If you are expecting some objects to be deleted and they
    aren&#x2019;t, check all of those locations and decide whether it makes
    sense in your case to remove those references.</p>
<p class="Pp">On the other hand, when <i>git gc</i> runs concurrently with
    another process, there is a risk of it deleting an object that the other
    process is using but hasn&#x2019;t created a reference to. This may just
    cause the other process to fail or may corrupt the repository if the other
    process later adds a reference to the deleted object. Git has two features
    that significantly mitigate this problem:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 1.Any object with modification time newer than the
  <b>--prune</b> date is kept, along with everything reachable from it.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 2.Most operations that add an object to the database
  update the modification time of the object if it is already present so that #1
  applies.</div>
<p class="Pp">However, these features fall short of a complete solution, so
    users who run commands concurrently have to live with some risk of
    corruption (which seems to be low in practice).</p>
