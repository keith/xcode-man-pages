Runs a number of housekeeping tasks within the current repository, such as
  compressing file revisions (to reduce disk space and increase performance),
  removing unreachable objects which may have been created from prior
  invocations of <i>git add</i>, packing refs, pruning reflog, rerere metadata
  or stale working trees. May also update ancillary indexes such as the
  commit-graph.
<p class="Pp">When common porcelain operations that create objects are run, they
    will check whether the repository has grown substantially since the last
    maintenance, and if so run <b>git gc</b> automatically. See <b>gc.auto</b>
    below for how to disable this behavior.</p>
<p class="Pp">Running <b>git gc</b> manually should only be needed when adding
    objects to a repository without regularly running such porcelain commands,
    to do a one-off repository optimization, or e.g. to clean up a suboptimal
    mass-import. See the &quot;PACKFILE OPTIMIZATION&quot; section in
    <b>git-fast-import</b>(1) for more details on the import case.</p>
</section>

<h1 class="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
--aggressive
<div class="Bd-indent">Usually <i>git gc</i> runs very quickly while providing
  good disk space utilization and performance. This option will cause <i>git
  gc</i> to more aggressively optimize the repository at the expense of taking
  much more time. The effects of this optimization are mostly persistent. See
  the &quot;AGGRESSIVE&quot; section below for details.</div>
<p class="Pp">--auto</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">With this option, <i>git gc</i> checks whether any
  housekeeping is required; if not, it exits without performing any work.
<p class="Pp">See the <b>gc.auto</b> option in the &quot;CONFIGURATION&quot;
    section below for how this heuristic works.</p>
<p class="Pp">Once housekeeping is triggered by exceeding the limits of
    configuration options such as <b>gc.auto</b> and <b>gc.autoPackLimit</b>,
    all other housekeeping tasks (e.g. rerere, working trees, reflog...) will be
    performed as well.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--prune=&lt;date&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Prune loose objects older than date (default is 2 weeks
  ago, overridable by the config variable <b>gc.pruneExpire</b>). --prune=now
  prunes loose objects regardless of their age and increases the risk of
  corruption if another process is writing to the repository concurrently; see
  &quot;NOTES&quot; below. --prune is on by default.</div>
<p class="Pp">--no-prune</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Do not prune any loose objects.</div>
<p class="Pp">--quiet</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Suppress all progress reports.</div>
<p class="Pp">--force</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Force <b>git gc</b> to run even if there may be another
  <b>git gc</b> instance running on this repository.</div>
<p class="Pp">--keep-largest-pack</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">All packs except the largest pack and those marked with a
  <b>.keep</b> files are consolidated into a single pack. When this option is
  used, <b>gc.bigPackThreshold</b> is ignored.</div>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="AGGRESSIVE"><a class="permalink" href="#AGGRESSIVE">AGGRESSIVE</a></h1>
When the <b>--aggressive</b> option is supplied, <b>git-repack</b>(1) will be
  invoked with the <b>-f</b> flag, which in turn will pass
  <b>--no-reuse-delta</b> to <b>git-pack-objects</b>(1). This will throw away
  any existing deltas and re-compute them, at the expense of spending much more
  time on the repacking.
<p class="Pp">The effects of this are mostly persistent, e.g. when packs and
    loose objects are coalesced into one another pack the existing deltas in
    that pack might get re-used, but there are also various cases where we might
    pick a sub-optimal delta from a newer pack instead.</p>
<p class="Pp">Furthermore, supplying <b>--aggressive</b> will tweak the
    <b>--depth</b> and <b>--window</b> options passed to <b>git-repack</b>(1).
    See the <b>gc.aggressiveDepth</b> and <b>gc.aggressiveWindow</b> settings
    below. By using a larger window size we&#x2019;re more likely to find more
    optimal deltas.</p>
<p class="Pp">It&#x2019;s probably not worth it to use this option on a given
    repository without running tailored performance benchmarks on it. It takes a
    lot more time, and the resulting space/delta optimization may or may not be
    worth it. Not using this at all is the right trade-off for most users and
    their repositories.</p>

The below documentation is the same as what&#x2019;s found in
  <b>git-config</b>(1):
<p class="Pp">gc.aggressiveDepth</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The depth parameter used in the delta compression
  algorithm used by <i>git gc --aggressive</i>. This defaults to 50, which is
  the default for the <b>--depth</b> option when <b>--aggressive</b>
  isn&#x2019;t in use.
<p class="Pp">See the documentation for the <b>--depth</b> option in
    <b>git-repack</b>(1) for more details.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">gc.aggressiveWindow</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The window size parameter used in the delta compression
  algorithm used by <i>git gc --aggressive</i>. This defaults to 250, which is a
  much more aggressive window size than the default <b>--window</b> of 10.
<p class="Pp">See the documentation for the <b>--window</b> option in
    <b>git-repack</b>(1) for more details.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">gc.auto</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When there are approximately more than this many loose
  objects in the repository, <b>git gc --auto</b> will pack them. Some Porcelain
  commands use this command to perform a light-weight garbage collection from
  time to time. The default value is 6700.
<p class="Pp">Setting this to 0 disables not only automatic packing based on the
    number of loose objects, but any other heuristic <b>git gc --auto</b> will
    otherwise use to determine if there&#x2019;s work to do, such as
    <b>gc.autoPackLimit</b>.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">gc.autoPackLimit</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When there are more than this many packs that are not
  marked with <b>*.keep</b> file in the repository, <b>git gc --auto</b>
  consolidates them into one larger pack. The default value is 50. Setting this
  to 0 disables it. Setting <b>gc.auto</b> to 0 will also disable this.
<p class="Pp">See the <b>gc.bigPackThreshold</b> configuration variable below.
    When in use, it&#x2019;ll affect how the auto pack limit works.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">gc.autoDetach</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Make <b>git gc --auto</b> return immediately and run in
  background if the system supports it. Default is true.</div>
<p class="Pp">gc.bigPackThreshold</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If non-zero, all packs larger than this limit are kept
  when <b>git gc</b> is run. This is very similar to <b>--keep-largest-pack</b>
  except that all packs that meet the threshold are kept, not just the largest
  pack. Defaults to zero. Common unit suffixes of <i>k</i>, <i>m</i>, or
  <i>g</i> are supported.
<p class="Pp">Note that if the number of kept packs is more than
    gc.autoPackLimit, this configuration variable is ignored, all packs except
    the base pack will be repacked. After this the number of packs should go
    below gc.autoPackLimit and gc.bigPackThreshold should be respected
  again.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the amount of memory estimated for <b>git repack</b> to run
    smoothly is not available and <b>gc.bigPackThreshold</b> is not set, the
    largest pack will also be excluded (this is the equivalent of running <b>git
    gc</b> with <b>--keep-largest-pack</b>).</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">gc.writeCommitGraph</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If true, then gc will rewrite the commit-graph file when
  <b>git-gc</b>(1) is run. When using <b>git gc --auto</b> the commit-graph will
  be updated if housekeeping is required. Default is true. See
  <b>git-commit-graph</b>(1) for details.</div>
<p class="Pp">gc.logExpiry</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If the file gc.log exists, then <b>git gc --auto</b> will
  print its content and exit with status zero instead of running unless that
  file is more than <i>gc.logExpiry</i> old. Default is &quot;1.day&quot;. See
  <b>gc.pruneExpire</b> for more ways to specify its value.</div>
<p class="Pp">gc.packRefs</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Running <b>git pack-refs</b> in a repository renders it
  unclonable by Git versions prior to 1.5.1.2 over dumb transports such as HTTP.
  This variable determines whether <i>git gc</i> runs <b>git pack-refs</b>. This
  can be set to <b>notbare</b> to enable it within all non-bare repos or it can
  be set to a boolean value. The default is <b>true</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">gc.pruneExpire</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When <i>git gc</i> is run, it will call <i>prune --expire
  2.weeks.ago</i>. Override the grace period with this config variable. The
  value &quot;now&quot; may be used to disable this grace period and always
  prune unreachable objects immediately, or &quot;never&quot; may be used to
  suppress pruning. This feature helps prevent corruption when <i>git gc</i>
  runs concurrently with another process writing to the repository; see the
  &quot;NOTES&quot; section of <b>git-gc</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">gc.worktreePruneExpire</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When <i>git gc</i> is run, it calls <i>git worktree prune
  --expire 3.months.ago</i>. This config variable can be used to set a different
  grace period. The value &quot;now&quot; may be used to disable the grace
  period and prune <b>$GIT_DIR/worktrees</b> immediately, or &quot;never&quot;
  may be used to suppress pruning.</div>
<p class="Pp">gc.reflogExpire, gc.&lt;pattern&gt;.reflogExpire</p>
<div class="Bd-indent"><i>git reflog expire</i> removes reflog entries older
  than this time; defaults to 90 days. The value &quot;now&quot; expires all
  entries immediately, and &quot;never&quot; suppresses expiration altogether.
  With &quot;&lt;pattern&gt;&quot; (e.g. &quot;refs/stash&quot;) in the middle
  the setting applies only to the refs that match the &lt;pattern&gt;.</div>
<p class="Pp">gc.reflogExpireUnreachable,
    gc.&lt;pattern&gt;.reflogExpireUnreachable</p>
<div class="Bd-indent"><i>git reflog expire</i> removes reflog entries older
  than this time and are not reachable from the current tip; defaults to 30
  days. The value &quot;now&quot; expires all entries immediately, and
  &quot;never&quot; suppresses expiration altogether. With
  &quot;&lt;pattern&gt;&quot; (e.g. &quot;refs/stash&quot;) in the middle, the
  setting applies only to the refs that match the &lt;pattern&gt;.
<p class="Pp">These types of entries are generally created as a result of using
    <b>git commit --amend</b> or <b>git rebase</b> and are the commits prior to
    the amend or rebase occurring. Since these changes are not part of the
    current project most users will want to expire them sooner, which is why the
    default is more aggressive than <b>gc.reflogExpire</b>.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">gc.rerereResolved</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Records of conflicted merge you resolved earlier are kept
  for this many days when <i>git rerere gc</i> is run. You can also use more
  human-readable &quot;1.month.ago&quot;, etc. The default is 60 days. See
  <b>git-rerere</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">gc.rerereUnresolved</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Records of conflicted merge you have not resolved are
  kept for this many days when <i>git rerere gc</i> is run. You can also use
  more human-readable &quot;1.month.ago&quot;, etc. The default is 15 days. See
  <b>git-rerere</b>(1).</div>

<h1 class="Sh" id="NOTES"><a class="permalink" href="#NOTES">NOTES</a></h1>
<i>git gc</i> tries very hard not to delete objects that are referenced anywhere
  in your repository. In particular, it will keep not only objects referenced by
  your current set of branches and tags, but also objects referenced by the
  index, remote-tracking branches, notes saved by <i>git notes</i> under
  refs/notes/, reflogs (which may reference commits in branches that were later
  amended or rewound), and anything else in the refs/* namespace. If you are
  expecting some objects to be deleted and they aren&#x2019;t, check all of
  those locations and decide whether it makes sense in your case to remove those
  references.
<p class="Pp">On the other hand, when <i>git gc</i> runs concurrently with
    another process, there is a risk of it deleting an object that the other
    process is using but hasn&#x2019;t created a reference to. This may just
    cause the other process to fail or may corrupt the repository if the other
    process later adds a reference to the deleted object. Git has two features
    that significantly mitigate this problem:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 1.Any object with modification time newer than the
  <b>--prune</b> date is kept, along with everything reachable from it.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 2.Most operations that add an object to the database
  update the modification time of the object if it is already present so that #1
  applies.</div>
<p class="Pp">However, these features fall short of a complete solution, so
    users who run commands concurrently have to live with some risk of
    corruption (which seems to be low in practice).</p>
