   Set up some character translations and predefined strings.  \*(-- will
   give an unbreakable dash, \*(PI will give pi, \*(L" will give a left
   double quote, and \*(R" will give a right double quote.  \*(C+ will
   give a nicer C++.  Capital omega is used to do unbreakable dashes and
   therefore won't be available.  \*(C` and \*(C' expand to `' in nroff,
   nothing in troff, for use with C<>.

<span class="Li">&quot;Class::Struct&quot;</span> exports a single function,
  <span class="Li">&quot;struct&quot;</span>. Given a list of element names and
  types, and optionally a class name, <span class="Li">&quot;struct&quot;</span>
  creates a Perl 5 class that implements a &quot;struct-like&quot; data
  structure.
<p class="Pp">The new class is given a constructor method,
    <span class="Li">&quot;new&quot;</span>, for creating struct objects.</p>
<p class="Pp">Each element in the struct data has an accessor method, which is
    used to assign to the element and to fetch its value. The default accessor
    can be overridden by declaring a <span class="Li">&quot;sub&quot;</span> of
    the same name in the package. (See Example 2.)</p>
<p class="Pp">Each element's type can be scalar, array, hash, or class.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="The__struct()__function"><a class="permalink" href="#The__struct()__function">The
  &quot;struct()&quot; function</a></h2>
The <span class="Li">&quot;struct&quot;</span> function has three forms of
  parameter-list.
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    struct( CLASS_NAME =&gt; [ ELEMENT_LIST ]);
    struct( CLASS_NAME =&gt; { ELEMENT_LIST });
    struct( ELEMENT_LIST );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The first and second forms explicitly identify the name of the
    class being created. The third form assumes the current package name as the
    class name.</p>
<p class="Pp">An object of a class created by the first and third forms is based
    on an array, whereas an object of a class created by the second form is
    based on a hash. The array-based forms will be somewhat faster and smaller;
    the hash-based forms are more flexible.</p>
<p class="Pp">The class created by <span class="Li">&quot;struct&quot;</span>
    must not be a subclass of another class other than
    <span class="Li">&quot;UNIVERSAL&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">It can, however, be used as a superclass for other classes. To
    facilitate this, the generated constructor method uses a two-argument
    blessing. Furthermore, if the class is hash-based, the key of each element
    is prefixed with the class name (see <i>Perl Cookbook</i>, Recipe
  13.12).</p>
<p class="Pp">A function named <span class="Li">&quot;new&quot;</span> must not
    be explicitly defined in a class created by
    <span class="Li">&quot;struct&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>ELEMENT_LIST</i> has the form</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    NAME =&gt; TYPE, ...
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Each name-type pair declares one element of the struct. Each
    element name will be defined as an accessor method unless a method by that
    name is explicitly defined; in the latter case, a warning is issued if the
    warning flag (<b>-w</b>) is set.</p>

  Creation at Compile Time</a></h2>
<span class="Li">&quot;Class::Struct&quot;</span> can create your class at
  compile time. The main reason for doing this is obvious, so your class acts
  like every other class in Perl. Creating your class at compile time will make
  the order of events similar to using any other class ( or Perl module ).
<p class="Pp">There is no significant speed gain between compile time and run
    time class creation, there is just a new, more standard order of events.</p>

    declared type of the element.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>Scalar ('$' or '*$')</dt>
  <dd>The element is a scalar, and by default is initialized to
      <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> (but see &quot;Initializing with

    <p class="Pp">The accessor's argument, if any, is assigned to the

    <p class="Pp">With one or two arguments, the first argument is an index
        specifying one element of the array; the second argument, if present, is

<p class="Pp">Each initializer is a pair of values: <i>element

Modified by Damian Conway, 2001-09-10, v0.62.
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
   Modified implicit construction of nested objects.
   Now will also take an object ref instead of requiring a hash ref.
   Also default initializes nested object attributes to undef, rather
   than calling object constructor without args
   Original over-helpfulness was fraught with problems:
       * the class's constructor might not be called 'new'
       * the class might not have a hash-like-arguments constructor
       * the class might not have a no-argument constructor
       * &quot;recursive&quot; data structures didn't work well:
                 package Person;
                 struct { mother =&gt; 'Person', father =&gt; 'Person'};
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Modified by Casey West, 2000-11-08, v0.59.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    Added the ability for compile time class creation.
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Modified by Damian Conway, 1999-03-05, v0.58.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    Added handling of hash-like arg list to class ctor.

    Changed to two-argument blessing in ctor to support
    derivation from created classes.

    Added classname prefixes to keys in hash-based classes
    (refer to &quot;Perl Cookbook&quot;, Recipe 13.12 for rationale).

    Corrected behaviour of accessors for '*@' and '*%' struct
    elements.  Package now implements documented behaviour when
    returning a reference to an entire hash or array element.
    Previously these were returned as a reference to a reference
    to the element.
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Renamed to <span class="Li">&quot;Class::Struct&quot;</span> and
    modified by Jim Miner, 1997-04-02.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    members() function removed.
    Documentation corrected and extended.
    Use of struct() in a subclass prohibited.
    User definition of accessor allowed.
    Treatment of '*' in element types corrected.
    Treatment of classes as element types corrected.
    Class name to struct() made optional.
    Diagnostic checks added.
