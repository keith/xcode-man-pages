<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;Time::HiRes&quot;</span> module
    implements a Perl interface to the
    <span class="Li">&quot;usleep&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;nanosleep&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;ualarm&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;gettimeofday&quot;</span>, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;setitimer&quot;</span>/<span class="Li">&quot;getitimer&quot;</span>
    system calls, in other words, high resolution time and timers. See the
    &quot;EXAMPLES&quot; section below and the test scripts for usage; see your
    system documentation for the description of the underlying
    <span class="Li">&quot;nanosleep&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;usleep&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;ualarm&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;gettimeofday&quot;</span>, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;setitimer&quot;</span>/<span class="Li">&quot;getitimer&quot;</span>
    calls.</p>
<p class="Pp">If your system lacks
    <span class="Li">&quot;gettimeofday()&quot;</span> or an emulation of it you
    don't get <span class="Li">&quot;gettimeofday()&quot;</span> or the
    one-argument form of <span class="Li">&quot;tv_interval()&quot;</span>. If
    your system lacks all of <span class="Li">&quot;nanosleep()&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;usleep()&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;select()&quot;</span>, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;poll&quot;</span>, you don't get
    <span class="Li">&quot;Time::HiRes::usleep()&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;Time::HiRes::nanosleep()&quot;</span>, or
    <span class="Li">&quot;Time::HiRes::sleep()&quot;</span>. If your system
    lacks both <span class="Li">&quot;ualarm()&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;setitimer()&quot;</span> you don't get
    <span class="Li">&quot;Time::HiRes::ualarm()&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;Time::HiRes::alarm()&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you try to import an unimplemented function in the
    <span class="Li">&quot;use&quot;</span> statement it will fail at compile
    time.</p>
<p class="Pp">If your subsecond sleeping is implemented with
    <span class="Li">&quot;nanosleep()&quot;</span> instead of
    <span class="Li">&quot;usleep()&quot;</span>, you can mix subsecond sleeping
    with signals since <span class="Li">&quot;nanosleep()&quot;</span> does not
    use signals. This, however, is not portable, and you should first check for
    the truth value of <span class="Li">&amp;Time::HiRes::d_nanosleep</span> to
    see whether you have nanosleep, and then carefully read your
    <span class="Li">&quot;nanosleep()&quot;</span> C API documentation for any
    peculiarities.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you are using <span class="Li">&quot;nanosleep&quot;</span> for
    something else than mixing sleeping with signals, give some thought to
    whether Perl is the tool you should be using for work requiring nanosecond
    accuracies.</p>
<p class="Pp">Remember that unless you are working on a <i>hard realtime</i>
    system, any clocks and timers will be imprecise, especially so if you are
    working in a pre-emptive multiuser system. Understand the difference between
    <i>wallclock time</i> and process time (in UNIX-like systems the sum of
    <i>user</i> and <i>system</i> times). Any attempt to sleep for X seconds
    will most probably end up sleeping <b>more</b> than that, but don't be
    surprised if you end up sleeping slightly <b>less</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following functions can be imported from this module. No
    functions are exported by default.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="gettimeofday"><a class="permalink" href="#gettimeofday">gettimeofday
    ()</a></dt>
  <dd>In array context returns a two-element array with the seconds and
      microseconds since the epoch. In scalar context returns floating seconds
      like <span class="Li">&quot;Time::HiRes::time()&quot;</span> (see
    below).</dd>
  <dt id="usleep"><a class="permalink" href="#usleep">usleep ( $useconds
    )</a></dt>
  <dd>Sleeps for the number of microseconds (millionths of a second) specified.
      Returns the number of microseconds actually slept. Can sleep for more than
      one second, unlike the <span class="Li">&quot;usleep&quot;</span> system
      call. Can also sleep for zero seconds, which often works like a <i>thread
      yield</i>. See also
      <span class="Li">&quot;Time::HiRes::usleep()&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;Time::HiRes::sleep()&quot;</span>, and
      <span class="Li">&quot;Time::HiRes::clock_nanosleep()&quot;</span>.
    <p class="Pp">Do not expect <b>usleep()</b> to be exact down to one
        microsecond.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="nanosleep"><a class="permalink" href="#nanosleep">nanosleep (
    $nanoseconds )</a></dt>
  <dd>Sleeps for the number of nanoseconds (1e9ths of a second) specified.
      Returns the number of nanoseconds actually slept (accurate only to
      microseconds, the nearest thousand of them). Can sleep for more than one
      second. Can also sleep for zero seconds, which often works like a
      <i>thread yield</i>. See also
      <span class="Li">&quot;Time::HiRes::sleep()&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;Time::HiRes::usleep()&quot;</span>, and
      <span class="Li">&quot;Time::HiRes::clock_nanosleep()&quot;</span>.
    <p class="Pp">Do not expect <b>nanosleep()</b> to be exact down to one
        nanosecond. Getting even accuracy of one thousand nanoseconds is
      good.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="ualarm"><a class="permalink" href="#ualarm">ualarm ( $useconds [,
    $interval_useconds ] )</a></dt>
  <dd>Issues a <span class="Li">&quot;ualarm&quot;</span> call; the
      <span class="Li">$interval_useconds</span> is optional and will be zero if
      unspecified, resulting in <span class="Li">&quot;alarm&quot;</span>-like
      behaviour.
    <p class="Pp">Returns the remaining time in the alarm in microseconds, or
        <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> if an error occurred.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><b>ualarm</b>(0) will cancel an outstanding
      <b>ualarm()</b>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that the interaction between alarms and sleeps is
        unspecified.</p>

  <dd>tv_interval ( <span class="Li">$ref_to_gettimeofday</span> [,
      <span class="Li">$ref_to_later_gettimeofday</span>] )
    <p class="Pp">Returns the floating seconds between the two times, which
        should have been returned by
        <span class="Li">&quot;gettimeofday()&quot;</span>. If the second
        argument is omitted, then the current time is used.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="time"><a class="permalink" href="#time">time ()</a></dt>
  <dd>Returns a floating seconds since the epoch. This function can be imported,
      resulting in a nice drop-in replacement for the
      <span class="Li">&quot;time&quot;</span> provided with core Perl; see the
      &quot;EXAMPLES&quot; below.
    <p class="Pp"><b>NOTE 1</b>: This higher resolution timer can return values
        either less or more than the core
        <span class="Li">&quot;time()&quot;</span>, depending on whether your
        platform rounds the higher resolution timer values up, down, or to the
        nearest second to get the core
        <span class="Li">&quot;time()&quot;</span>, but naturally the difference
        should be never more than half a second. See also
        &quot;clock_getres&quot;, if available in your system.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><b>NOTE 2</b>: Since Sunday, September 9th, 2001 at 01:46:40
        AM GMT, when the <span class="Li">&quot;time()&quot;</span> seconds
        since epoch rolled over to 1_000_000_000, the default floating point
        format of Perl and the seconds since epoch have conspired to produce an
        apparent bug: if you print the value of
        <span class="Li">&quot;Time::HiRes::time()&quot;</span> you seem to be
        getting only five decimals, not six as promised (microseconds). Not to
        worry, the microseconds are there (assuming your platform supports such
        granularity in the first place). What is going on is that the default
        floating point format of Perl only outputs 15 digits. In this case that
        means ten digits before the decimal separator and five after. To see the
        microseconds you can use either
        <span class="Li">&quot;printf&quot;</span>/<span class="Li">&quot;sprintf&quot;</span>
        with <span class="Li">&quot;%.6f&quot;</span>, or the
        <span class="Li">&quot;gettimeofday()&quot;</span> function in list
        context, which will give you the seconds and microseconds as two
        separate values.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="sleep"><a class="permalink" href="#sleep">sleep ( $floating_seconds
    )</a></dt>
  <dd>Sleeps for the specified amount of seconds. Returns the number of seconds
      actually slept (a floating point value). This function can be imported,
      resulting in a nice drop-in replacement for the
      <span class="Li">&quot;sleep&quot;</span> provided with perl, see the
      &quot;EXAMPLES&quot; below.
    <p class="Pp">Note that the interaction between alarms and sleeps is
        unspecified.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="alarm"><a class="permalink" href="#alarm">alarm ( $floating_seconds [,
    $interval_floating_seconds ] )</a></dt>
  <dd>The <span class="Li">&quot;SIGALRM&quot;</span> signal is sent after the
      specified number of seconds. Implemented using
      <span class="Li">&quot;setitimer()&quot;</span> if available,
      <span class="Li">&quot;ualarm()&quot;</span> if not. The
      <span class="Li">$interval_floating_seconds</span> argument is optional
      and will be zero if unspecified, resulting in
      <span class="Li">&quot;alarm()&quot;</span>-like behaviour. This function
      can be imported, resulting in a nice drop-in replacement for the
      <span class="Li">&quot;alarm&quot;</span> provided with perl, see the
      &quot;EXAMPLES&quot; below.
    <p class="Pp">Returns the remaining time in the alarm in seconds, or
        <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> if an error occurred.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><b>NOTE 1</b>: With some combinations of operating systems and
        Perl releases <span class="Li">&quot;SIGALRM&quot;</span> restarts
        <span class="Li">&quot;select()&quot;</span>, instead of interrupting
        it. This means that an <span class="Li">&quot;alarm()&quot;</span>
        followed by a <span class="Li">&quot;select()&quot;</span> may together
        take the sum of the times specified for the
        <span class="Li">&quot;alarm()&quot;</span> and the
        <span class="Li">&quot;select()&quot;</span>, not just the time of the

  <dt id="setitimer"><a class="permalink" href="#setitimer">setitimer ( $which,

  <dd>Start up an interval timer: after a certain time, a signal ($which)
      arrives, and more signals may keep arriving at certain intervals. To
      disable an &quot;itimer&quot;, use
      <span class="Li">$floating_seconds</span> of zero. If the
      <span class="Li">$interval_floating_seconds</span> is set to zero (or
      unspecified), the timer is disabled <b>after</b> the next delivered
      signal.
    <p class="Pp">Use of interval timers may interfere with
        <span class="Li">&quot;alarm()&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;sleep()&quot;</span>, and
        <span class="Li">&quot;usleep()&quot;</span>. In standard-speak the
        &quot;interaction is unspecified&quot;, which means that <i>anything</i>
        may happen: it may work, it may not.</p>
    <p class="Pp">In scalar context, the remaining time in the timer is
        returned.</p>
    <p class="Pp">In list context, both the remaining time and the interval are
        returned.</p>
    <p class="Pp">There are usually three or four interval timers (signals)
        available: the <span class="Li">$which</span> can be
        <span class="Li">&quot;ITIMER_REAL&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;ITIMER_VIRTUAL&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;ITIMER_PROF&quot;</span>, or
        <span class="Li">&quot;ITIMER_REALPROF&quot;</span>. Note that which
        ones are available depends: true UNIX platforms usually have the first
        three, but only Solaris seems to have
        <span class="Li">&quot;ITIMER_REALPROF&quot;</span> (which is used to
        profile multithreaded programs). Win32 unfortunately does not have
        interval timers.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;ITIMER_REAL&quot;</span> results in
        <span class="Li">&quot;alarm()&quot;</span>-like behaviour. Time is
        counted in <i>real time</i>; that is, wallclock time.
        <span class="Li">&quot;SIGALRM&quot;</span> is delivered when the timer
        expires.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;ITIMER_VIRTUAL&quot;</span> counts time
        in (process) <i>virtual time</i>; that is, only when the process is
        running. In multiprocessor/user/CPU systems this may be more or less
        than real or wallclock time. (This time is also known as the <i>user
        time</i>.) <span class="Li">&quot;SIGVTALRM&quot;</span> is delivered
        when the timer expires.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;ITIMER_PROF&quot;</span> counts time
        when either the process virtual time or when the operating system is
        running on behalf of the process (such as I/O). (This time is also known
        as the <i>system time</i>.) (The sum of user time and system time is
        known as the <i>CPU time</i>.)
        <span class="Li">&quot;SIGPROF&quot;</span> is delivered when the timer
        expires. <span class="Li">&quot;SIGPROF&quot;</span> can interrupt
        system calls.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The semantics of interval timers for multithreaded programs
        are system-specific, and some systems may support additional interval
        timers. For example, it is unspecified which thread gets the signals.

      potentially useful (but not available everywhere) value is
      <span class="Li">&quot;CLOCK_MONOTONIC&quot;</span>, which guarantees a
      monotonically increasing time value (unlike <b>time()</b> or

        <b>clock_nanosleep()</b> with that resolution. The system might not
        actually be able to measure events at that resolution, and the various

      the process since the first call to <b>clock()</b> (the definition is
      <b>not</b> &quot;since the start of the process&quot;, though if you are

      override the standard <b>stat()</b>:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    use Time::HiRes qw(stat);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Test for the value of &amp;Time::HiRes::d_hires_stat to find
        out whether the operating system supports subsecond file timestamps: a
        value larger than zero means yes. There are unfortunately no easy ways
        to find out whether the filesystem supports such timestamps. UNIX
        filesystems often do; NTFS does; FAT doesn't (FAT timestamp granularity
        is <b>two</b> seconds).</p>
    <p class="Pp">A zero return value of &amp;Time::HiRes::d_hires_stat means
        that Time::HiRes::stat is a no-op passthrough for <b>CORE::stat()</b>
        (and likewise for lstat), and therefore the timestamps will stay
        integers. The same thing will happen if the filesystem does not do
        subsecond timestamps, even if the &amp;Time::HiRes::d_hires_stat is
        non-zero.</p>
    <p class="Pp">In any case do not expect nanosecond resolution, or even a
        microsecond resolution. Also note that the modify/access timestamps
        might have different resolutions, and that they need not be
        synchronized, e.g. if the operations are</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    write
    stat # t1
    read
    stat # t2
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">the access time stamp from t2 need not be greater-than the
        modify time stamp from t1: it may be equal or <i>less</i>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="utime"><a class="permalink" href="#utime">utime LIST</a></dt>
  <dd>As &quot;utime&quot; in perlfunc but with the ability to set the
      access/modify file timestamps in subsecond resolution, if the operating
      system and the filesystem, and the mount options of the filesystem, all
      support such timestamps.
    <p class="Pp">To override the standard <b>utime()</b>:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    use Time::HiRes qw(utime);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Test for the value of &amp;Time::HiRes::d_hires_utime to find
        out whether the operating system supports setting subsecond file
        timestamps.</p>
    <p class="Pp">As with <b>CORE::utime()</b>, passing undef as both the atime
        and mtime will call the syscall with a NULL argument.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The actual achievable subsecond resolution depends on the
        combination of the operating system and the filesystem.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Modifying the timestamps may not be possible at all: for
        example, the <span class="Li">&quot;noatime&quot;</span> filesystem
        mount option may prohibit you from changing the access time
      timestamp.</p>

<p class="Pp">Notice that the core <span class="Li">&quot;time()&quot;</span>
    maybe rounding rather than truncating. What this means is that the core
    <span class="Li">&quot;time()&quot;</span> may be reporting the time as one
    second later than <span class="Li">&quot;gettimeofday()&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;Time::HiRes::time()&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Adjusting the system clock (either manually or by services like
    ntp) may cause problems, especially for long running programs that assume a
    monotonously increasing time (note that all platforms do not adjust time as
    gracefully as UNIX ntp does). For example in Win32 (and derived platforms
    like Cygwin and MinGW) the <b>Time::HiRes::time()</b> may temporarily drift
    off from the system clock (and the original <b>time()</b>) by up to 0.5
    seconds. Time::HiRes will notice this eventually and recalibrate. Note that
    since Time::HiRes 1.77 the clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC) might help in this
    (in case your system supports CLOCK_MONOTONIC).</p>
<p class="Pp">Some systems have APIs but not implementations: for example QNX
    and Haiku have the interval timer APIs but not the functionality.</p>
<p class="Pp">In pre-Sierra macOS (pre-10.12, OS X) <b>clock_getres()</b>,
    <b>clock_gettime()</b> and <b>clock_nanosleep()</b> are emulated using the
    Mach timers; as a side effect of being emulated the CLOCK_REALTIME and
    CLOCK_MONOTONIC are the same timer.</p>
<p class="Pp">gnukfreebsd seems to have non-functional <b>futimens()</b> and
