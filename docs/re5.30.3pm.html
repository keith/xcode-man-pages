When <span class="Li">&quot;use re 'taint'&quot;</span> is in effect, and a
  tainted string is the target of a regexp, the regexp memories (or values
  returned by the m// operator in list context) are tainted. This feature is
  useful when regexp operations on tainted data aren't meant to extract safe
  substrings, but to perform other transformations.
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="'eval'_mode"><a class="permalink" href="#'eval'_mode">'eval'
  mode</a></h2>
When <span class="Li">&quot;use re 'eval'&quot;</span> is in effect, a regexp is
  allowed to contain <span class="Li">&quot;(?{ ... })&quot;</span> zero-width
  assertions and <span class="Li">&quot;(??{ ... })&quot;</span> postponed
  subexpressions that are derived from variable interpolation, rather than
  appearing literally within the regexp. That is normally disallowed, since it
  is a potential security risk. Note that this pragma is ignored when the
  regular expression is obtained from tainted data, i.e. evaluation is always
  disallowed with tainted regular expressions. See &quot;(?{ code })&quot; in
  perlre and &quot;(??{ code })&quot; in perlre.
<p class="Pp">For the purpose of this pragma, interpolation of precompiled
    regular expressions (i.e., the result of
    <span class="Li">&quot;qr//&quot;</span>) is <i>not</i> considered variable
    interpolation. Thus:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    /foo${pat}bar/
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><i>is</i> allowed if <span class="Li">$pat</span> is a precompiled
    regular expression, even if <span class="Li">$pat</span> contains
    <span class="Li">&quot;(?{ ... })&quot;</span> assertions or
    <span class="Li">&quot;(??{ ... })&quot;</span> subexpressions.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="'strict'_mode"><a class="permalink" href="#'strict'_mode">'strict'
  mode</a></h2>
Note that this is an experimental feature which may be changed or removed in a
  future Perl release.
<p class="Pp">When <span class="Li">&quot;use re 'strict'&quot;</span> is in
    effect, stricter checks are applied than otherwise when compiling regular
    expressions patterns. These may cause more warnings to be raised than
    otherwise, and more things to be fatal instead of just warnings. The purpose
    of this is to find and report at compile time some things, which may be
    legal, but have a reasonable possibility of not being the programmer's
    actual intent. This automatically turns on the
    <span class="Li">&quot;regexp&quot;</span> warnings category (if not already
    on) within its scope.</p>
<p class="Pp">As an example of something that is caught under
    <span class="Li">&quot;&quot;strict'&quot;</span>, but not otherwise, is the
    pattern</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
 qr/\xABC/
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;\x&quot;</span> construct without curly
    braces should be followed by exactly two hex digits; this one is followed by
    three. This currently evaluates as equivalent to</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
 qr/\x{AB}C/
</pre>
<p class="Pp">that is, the character whose code point value is
    <span class="Li">0xAB</span>, followed by the letter
    <span class="Li">&quot;C&quot;</span>. But since
    <span class="Li">&quot;C&quot;</span> is a a hex digit, there is a
    reasonable chance that the intent was</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
 qr/\x{ABC}/
</pre>
<p class="Pp">that is the single character at <span class="Li">0xABC</span>.
    Under <span class="Li">'strict'</span> it is an error to not follow
    <span class="Li">&quot;\x&quot;</span> with exactly two hex digits. When not
    under <span class="Li">'strict'</span> a warning is generated if there is
    only one hex digit, and no warning is raised if there are more than two.</p>
<p class="Pp">It is expected that what exactly <span class="Li">'strict'</span>
    does will evolve over time as we gain experience with it. This means that
    programs that compile under it in today's Perl may not compile, or may have
    more or fewer warnings, in future Perls. There is no backwards compatibility
    promises with regards to it. Also there are already proposals for an
    alternate syntax for enabling it. For these reasons, using it will raise a
    <span class="Li">&quot;experimental::re_strict&quot;</span> class warning,
    unless that category is turned off.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that if a pattern compiled within
    <span class="Li">'strict'</span> is recompiled, say by interpolating into
    another pattern, outside of <span class="Li">'strict'</span>, it is not
    checked again for strictness. This is because if it works under strict it
    must work under non-strict.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="'/flags'_mode"><a class="permalink" href="#'/flags'_mode">'/flags'
  mode</a></h2>
When <span class="Li">&quot;use re
  '/</span><i>flags</i><span class="Li">'&quot;</span> is specified, the given
  <i>flags</i> are automatically added to every regular expression till the end
  of the lexical scope. <i>flags</i> can be any combination of
  <span class="Li">'a'</span>, <span class="Li">'aa'</span>,
  <span class="Li">'d'</span>, <span class="Li">'i'</span>,
  <span class="Li">'l'</span>, <span class="Li">'m'</span>,
  <span class="Li">'n'</span>, <span class="Li">'p'</span>,
  <span class="Li">'s'</span>, <span class="Li">'u'</span>,
  <span class="Li">'x'</span>, and/or <span class="Li">'xx'</span>.
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;no re
    '/</span><i>flags</i><span class="Li">'&quot;</span> will turn off the
    effect of <span class="Li">&quot;use re
    '/</span><i>flags</i><span class="Li">'&quot;</span> for the given
  flags.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, if you want all your regular expressions to have
    /msxx on by default, simply put</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    use re '/msxx';
</pre>
<p class="Pp">at the top of your code.</p>
<p class="Pp">The character set <span class="Li">&quot;/adul&quot;</span> flags
    cancel each other out. So, in this example,</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    use re &quot;/u&quot;;
    &quot;ss&quot; =~ /\xdf/;
    use re &quot;/d&quot;;
    &quot;ss&quot; =~ /\xdf/;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">the second <span class="Li">&quot;use re&quot;</span> does an
    implicit <span class="Li">&quot;no re '/u'&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Similarly,</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    use re &quot;/xx&quot;;   # Doubled-x
    ...
    use re &quot;/x&quot;;    # Single x from here on
    ...
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Turning on one of the character set flags with
    <span class="Li">&quot;use re&quot;</span> takes precedence over the
    <span class="Li">&quot;locale&quot;</span> pragma and the 'unicode_strings'
    <span class="Li">&quot;feature&quot;</span>, for regular expressions.
    Turning off one of these flags when it is active reverts to the behaviour
    specified by whatever other pragmata are in scope. For example:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    use feature &quot;unicode_strings&quot;;
    no re &quot;/u&quot;; # does nothing
    use re &quot;/l&quot;;
    no re &quot;/l&quot;; # reverts to unicode_strings behaviour

<h2 class="Ss" id="'debug'_mode"><a class="permalink" href="#'debug'_mode">'debug'
  mode</a></h2>
When <span class="Li">&quot;use re 'debug'&quot;</span> is in effect, perl emits
  debugging messages when compiling and using regular expressions. The output is
  the same as that obtained by running a
  <span class="Li">&quot;-DDEBUGGING&quot;</span>-enabled perl interpreter with
  the <b>-Dr</b> switch. It may be quite voluminous depending on the complexity
  of the match. Using <span class="Li">&quot;debugcolor&quot;</span> instead of
  <span class="Li">&quot;debug&quot;</span> enables a form of output that can be
  used to get a colorful display on terminals that understand termcap color
  sequences. Set <span class="Li">$ENV{PERL_RE_TC}</span> to a comma-separated
  list of <span class="Li">&quot;termcap&quot;</span> properties to use for
  highlighting strings on/off, pre-point part on/off. See &quot;Debugging
  Regular Expressions&quot; in perldebug for additional info.
<p class="Pp">As of 5.9.5 the directive <span class="Li">&quot;use re
    'debug'&quot;</span> and its equivalents are lexically scoped, as the other
    directives are. However they have both compile-time and run-time
  effects.</p>

Similarly <span class="Li">&quot;use re 'Debug'&quot;</span> produces debugging
  output, the difference being that it allows the fine tuning of what debugging
  output will be emitted. Options are divided into three groups, those related

<h2 class="Ss" id="Exportable_Functions"><a class="permalink" href="#Exportable_Functions">Exportable
  Functions</a></h2>
As of perl 5.9.5 're' debug contains a number of utility functions that may be
  optionally exported into the caller's namespace. They are listed below.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>is_regexp($ref)</dt>
  <dd>Returns true if the argument is a compiled regular expression as returned
      by <span class="Li">&quot;qr//&quot;</span>, false if it is not.
    <p class="Pp">This function will not be confused by overloading or blessing.
        In internals terms, this extracts the regexp pointer out of the
        PERL_MAGIC_qr structure so it cannot be fooled.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>regexp_pattern($ref)</dt>
  <dd>If the argument is a compiled regular expression as returned by
      <span class="Li">&quot;qr//&quot;</span>, then this function returns the
      pattern.
    <p class="Pp">In list context it returns a two element list, the first
        element containing the pattern and the second containing the modifiers
        used when the pattern was compiled.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
  my ($pat, $mods) = regexp_pattern($ref);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">In scalar context it returns the same as perl would when
        stringifying a raw <span class="Li">&quot;qr//&quot;</span> with the
        same pattern inside. If the argument is not a compiled reference then
        this routine returns false but defined in scalar context, and the empty
        list in list context. Thus the following</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    if (regexp_pattern($ref) eq '(?^i:foo)')
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">will be warning free regardless of what
        <span class="Li">$ref</span> actually is.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Like <span class="Li">&quot;is_regexp&quot;</span> this
        function will not be confused by overloading or blessing of the
      object.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>regmust($ref)</dt>
  <dd>If the argument is a compiled regular expression as returned by
      <span class="Li">&quot;qr//&quot;</span>, then this function returns what
      the optimiser considers to be the longest anchored fixed string and
      longest floating fixed string in the pattern.
    <p class="Pp">A <i>fixed string</i> is defined as being a substring that
        must appear for the pattern to match. An <i>anchored fixed string</i> is
        a fixed string that must appear at a particular offset from the
        beginning of the match. A <i>floating</i> <i>fixed string</i> is defined
        as a fixed string that can appear at any point in a range of positions
        relative to the start of the match. For example,</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    my $qr = qr/here .* there/x;
    my ($anchored, $floating) = regmust($qr);
    print &quot;anchored:'$anchored'\nfloating:'$floating'\n&quot;;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">results in</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    anchored:'here'
    floating:'there'
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Because the <span class="Li">&quot;here&quot;</span> is before
        the <span class="Li">&quot;.*&quot;</span> in the pattern, its position
        can be determined exactly. That's not true, however, for the
        <span class="Li">&quot;there&quot;</span>; it could appear at any point
        after where the anchored string appeared. Perl uses both for its
        optimisations, preferring the longer, or, if they are equal, the
        floating.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><b>NOTE:</b> This may not necessarily be the definitive
        longest anchored and floating string. This will be what the optimiser of
        the Perl that you are using thinks is the longest. If you believe that
        the result is wrong please report it via the perlbug utility.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>regname($name,$all)</dt>
  <dd>Returns the contents of a named buffer of the last successful match. If
      <span class="Li">$all</span> is true, then returns an array ref containing
      one entry per buffer, otherwise returns the first defined buffer.</dd>
  <dt>regnames($all)</dt>
  <dd>Returns a list of all of the named buffers defined in the last successful
      match. If <span class="Li">$all</span> is true, then it returns all names
      defined, if not it returns only names which were involved in the
    match.</dd>
  <dt><b>regnames_count()</b></dt>
  <dd>Returns the number of distinct names defined in the pattern used for the
      last successful match.
    <p class="Pp"><b>Note:</b> this result is always the actual number of
        distinct named buffers defined, it may not actually match that which is
        returned by <span class="Li">&quot;regnames()&quot;</span> and related
        routines when those routines have not been called with the
