   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

  	# Set up traps and other miscellaneous stuff for Tcl/Tk man pages.
  	# Start an argument description
  .b
  	# define tabbing values for .AP
  
  	# BS - start boxed text
  	# ^y = starting y location
  	# ^b = 1
  	# BE - end boxed text (draw box now)
  	Draw four-sided box normally, but don't draw top of
  	box if the box started on an earlier page.
  	# VS - start vertical sidebar
  	# ^Y = starting y location
  	# ^v = 1 (for troff;  for nroff this doesn't matter)
  	# VE - end of vertical sidebar
  	# Special macro to handle page bottom:  finish off current
  	# box/sidebar if in box/sidebar mode, then invoked standard
  	# page bottom macro.
  	Draw three-sided box if this is the box's first page,
  	draw two sides but no top otherwise.
  	# DS - begin display
  	# DE - end display
  	# SO - start of list of standard options
  	# SE - end of list of standard options
  	# OP - start of full description for a single option
  	# CS - begin code excerpt
  	# CE - end code excerpt
  	# UL - underline word
  	# QW - apply quotation marks to word
  " fix emacs highlighting
  	# PQ - apply parens and quotation marks to word
  " fix emacs highlighting
  	# QR - quoted range
  " fix emacs highlighting
  	# MT - "empty" string

Each window managed by Tk has two names, a short name that identifies a window
  among children of the same parent, and a path name that identifies the window
  uniquely among all the windows belonging to the same main window. The path
  name is used more often in Tk than the short name; many commands, like
  <b>bind</b>, expect path names as arguments.
<p class="Pp">The <b>Tk_Name</b> macro returns a window's short name, which is
    the same as the <i>name</i> argument passed to <b>Tk_CreateWindow</b> when
    the window was created. The value is returned as a Tk_Uid, which may be used
    just like a string pointer but also has the properties of a unique
    identifier (see the manual entry for <b>Tk_GetUid</b> for details).</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>Tk_PathName</b> macro returns a hierarchical name for
    <i>tkwin</i>. Path names have a structure similar to file names in Unix but
    with dots between elements instead of slashes: the main window for an
    application has the path name &#x201C;.&#x201D;; its children have names
    like &#x201C;.a&#x201D; and &#x201C;.b&#x201D;; their children have names
    like &#x201C;.a.aa&#x201D; and &#x201C;.b.bb&#x201D;; and so on. A window is
    considered to be a child of another window for naming purposes if the second
    window was named as the first window's <i>parent</i> when the first window
    was created. This is not always the same as the X window hierarchy. For
    example, a pop-up is created as a child of the root window, but its logical
    parent will usually be a window within the application.</p>
<p class="Pp">The procedure <b>Tk_NameToWindow</b> returns the token for a
    window given its path name (the <i>pathName</i> argument) and another window
    belonging to the same main window (<i>tkwin</i>). It normally returns a
    token for the named window, but if no such window exists
    <b>Tk_NameToWindow</b> leaves an error message in <i>interp-&gt;result</i>
    and returns NULL. The <i>tkwin</i> argument to <b>Tk_NameToWindow</b> is
    needed because path names are only unique within a single application
    hierarchy. If, for example, a single process has opened two main windows,
    each will have a separate naming hierarchy and the same path name might
    appear in each of the hierarchies. Normally <i>tkwin</i> is the main window
    of the desired hierarchy, but this need not be the case: any window in the
    desired hierarchy may be used.</p>
