When enabled, this pragma warns about indirect method calls that are present in
  your code.
<p class="Pp">The indirect syntax is now considered harmful, since its parsing
    has many quirks and its use is error prone : when the subroutine
    <span class="Li">&quot;foo&quot;</span> has not been declared in the current
    package, <span class="Li">&quot;foo $x&quot;</span> actually compiles to
    <span class="Li">&quot;$x-&gt;foo&quot;</span>, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;foo { key =&gt; 1 }&quot;</span> to
    <span class="Li">&quot;'key'-&gt;foo(1)&quot;</span>. Please refer to the
    &quot;REFERENCES&quot; section for a more complete list of reasons for
    avoiding this construct.</p>
<p class="Pp">This pragma currently does not warn for core functions
    (<span class="Li">&quot;print&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;say&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;exec&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;system&quot;</span>). This may change in the future,
    or may be added as optional features that would be enabled by passing
    options to <span class="Li">&quot;unimport&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">This module is <b>not</b> a source filter.</p>

<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>If it is a string that matches
      <span class="Li">&quot;/^:?fatal$/i&quot;</span>, the compilation will

  <li>If the key/value pair <span class="Li">&quot;hook =&gt; $hook&quot;</span>

      <span class="Li">$_[0]</span>, the method name as
      <span class="Li">$_[1]</span>, the current file as
      <span class="Li">$_[2]</span> and the line number as
      <span class="Li">$_[3]</span>. If and only if the object is actually a
      block, <span class="Li">$_[0]</span> is assured to start by
      <span class="Li">'{'</span>.
    <p class="Pp">This option is mutually exclusive with the
        <span class="Li">'fatal'</span> option.</p>
  </li>
  <li>If none of <span class="Li">&quot;fatal&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;hook&quot;</span> are specified, a warning will be
      emitted for each indirect method call.</li>
  <li>If <span class="Li">@opts</span> contains a string that matches

      globally enabled for <b>all</b> code compiled after the current
      <span class="Li">&quot;no indirect&quot;</span> statement, except for code
      that is in the lexical scope of <span class="Li">&quot;use
      indirect&quot;</span>. This option may come indifferently before or after
      the <span class="Li">&quot;fatal&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;hook&quot;</span> options, in the case they are
      also passed to &quot;unimport&quot;.
    <p class="Pp">The global policy applied is the one resulting of the
        <span class="Li">&quot;fatal&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;hook&quot;</span> options, thus defaults to a
        warning when none of those are specified :</p>

    no indirect 'global', hook =&gt; \&amp;hook # custom global action
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Note that if another policy is installed by a
        <span class="Li">&quot;no indirect&quot;</span> statement further in the
        code, it will overrule the global policy :</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>

If this environment variable is set to true when the pragma is used for the
  first time, the XS code won't be loaded and, although the
  <span class="Li">'indirect'</span> lexical hint will be set to true in the
  scope of use, the pragma itself won't do anything. In this case, the pragma
  will always be considered to be thread-safe, and as such
  &quot;I_THREADSAFE&quot; will be true. This is useful for disabling
  <span class="Li">&quot;indirect&quot;</span> in production environments.
<p class="Pp">Note that clearing this variable after
    <span class="Li">&quot;indirect&quot;</span> was loaded has no effect. If
    you want to re-enable the pragma later, you also need to reload it by
    deleting the <span class="Li">'indirect.pm'</span> entry from
    <span class="Li">%INC</span>.</p>

The implementation was tweaked to work around several limitations of vanilla
  <span class="Li">&quot;perl&quot;</span> pragmas : it's thread safe, and does
  not suffer from a <span class="Li">&quot;perl 5.8.x-5.10.0&quot;</span> bug
  that causes all pragmas to propagate into
  <span class="Li">&quot;require&quot;</span>d scopes.
<p class="Pp">Before <span class="Li">&quot;perl&quot;</span> 5.12,
    <span class="Li">&quot;meth $obj&quot;</span> (no semicolon) at the end of a
    file is not seen as an indirect method call, although it is as soon as there
    is another token before the end (as in <span class="Li">&quot;meth
    $obj;&quot;</span> or <span class="Li">&quot;meth $obj 1&quot;</span>). If
    you use <span class="Li">&quot;perl&quot;</span> 5.12 or greater, those
    constructs are correctly reported.</p>
<p class="Pp">With 5.8 perls, the pragma does not propagate into
    <span class="Li">&quot;eval STRING&quot;</span>. This is due to a
    shortcoming in the way perl handles the hints hash, which is addressed in
    perl 5.10.</p>
<p class="Pp">The search for indirect method calls happens before constant
    folding. Hence <span class="Li">&quot;my $x = new Class if 0&quot;</span>
    will be caught.</p>
