<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
If &lt;branch&gt; is specified, <i>git rebase</i> will perform an automatic
  <b>git switch &lt;branch&gt;</b> before doing anything else. Otherwise it
  remains on the current branch.
<p class="Pp">If &lt;upstream&gt; is not specified, the upstream configured in
    branch.&lt;name&gt;.remote and branch.&lt;name&gt;.merge options will be
    used (see <b>git-config</b>(1) for details) and the <b>--fork-point</b>
    option is assumed. If you are currently not on any branch or if the current
    branch does not have a configured upstream, the rebase will abort.</p>
<p class="Pp">All changes made by commits in the current branch but that are not
    in &lt;upstream&gt; are saved to a temporary area. This is the same set of
    commits that would be shown by <b>git log &lt;upstream&gt;..HEAD</b>; or by
    <b>git log 'fork_point'..HEAD</b>, if <b>--fork-point</b> is active (see the
    description on <b>--fork-point</b> below); or by <b>git log HEAD</b>, if the
    <b>--root</b> option is specified.</p>
<p class="Pp">The current branch is reset to &lt;upstream&gt;, or
    &lt;newbase&gt; if the --onto option was supplied. This has the exact same
    effect as <b>git reset --hard &lt;upstream&gt;</b> (or &lt;newbase&gt;).
    ORIG_HEAD is set to point at the tip of the branch before the reset.</p>
<p class="Pp">The commits that were previously saved into the temporary area are
    then reapplied to the current branch, one by one, in order. Note that any
    commits in HEAD which introduce the same textual changes as a commit in
    HEAD..&lt;upstream&gt; are omitted (i.e., a patch already accepted upstream
    with a different commit message or timestamp will be skipped).</p>
<p class="Pp">It is possible that a merge failure will prevent this process from
    being completely automatic. You will have to resolve any such merge failure
    and run <b>git rebase --continue</b>. Another option is to bypass the commit
    that caused the merge failure with <b>git rebase --skip</b>. To check out
    the original &lt;branch&gt; and remove the .git/rebase-apply working files,
    use the command <b>git rebase --abort</b> instead.</p>
<p class="Pp">Assume the following history exists and the current branch is
    &quot;topic&quot;:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
          A---B---C topic
         /
    D---E---F---G master
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">From this point, the result of either of the following
  commands:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
git rebase master
git rebase master topic
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">would be:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
                  A'--B'--C' topic
                 /
    D---E---F---G master
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp"><b>NOTE:</b> The latter form is just a short-hand of <b>git
    checkout topic</b> followed by <b>git rebase master</b>. When rebase exits
    <b>topic</b> will remain the checked-out branch.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the upstream branch already contains a change you have made
    (e.g., because you mailed a patch which was applied upstream), then that
    commit will be skipped. For example, running <b>git rebase master</b> on the
    following history (in which <b>A'</b> and <b>A</b> introduce the same set of
    changes, but have different committer information):</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
          A---B---C topic
         /
    D---E---A'---F master
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">will result in:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
                   B'---C' topic
                  /
    D---E---A'---F master
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">Here is how you would transplant a topic branch based on one
    branch to another, to pretend that you forked the topic branch from the
    latter branch, using <b>rebase --onto</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">First let&#x2019;s assume your <i>topic</i> is based on branch
    <i>next</i>. For example, a feature developed in <i>topic</i> depends on
    some functionality which is found in <i>next</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
    o---o---o---o---o  master
         \
          o---o---o---o---o  next
                           \
                            o---o---o  topic
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">We want to make <i>topic</i> forked from branch <i>master</i>; for
    example, because the functionality on which <i>topic</i> depends was merged
    into the more stable <i>master</i> branch. We want our tree to look like
    this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
    o---o---o---o---o  master
        |            \
        |             o'--o'--o'  topic
         \
          o---o---o---o---o  next
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">We can get this using the following command:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
git rebase --onto master next topic
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Another example of --onto option is to rebase part of a branch. If
    we have the following situation:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
                            H---I---J topicB
                           /
                  E---F---G  topicA
                 /
    A---B---C---D  master
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">then the command</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
git rebase --onto master topicA topicB
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">would result in:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
                 H'--I'--J'  topicB
                /
                | E---F---G  topicA
                |/
    A---B---C---D  master
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">This is useful when topicB does not depend on topicA.</p>
<p class="Pp">A range of commits could also be removed with rebase. If we have
    the following situation:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
    E---F---G---H---I---J  topicA
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">then the command</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
git rebase --onto topicA~5 topicA~3 topicA
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">would result in the removal of commits F and G:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
    E---H'---I'---J'  topicA
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">This is useful if F and G were flawed in some way, or should not
    be part of topicA. Note that the argument to --onto and the &lt;upstream&gt;
    parameter can be any valid commit-ish.</p>
<p class="Pp">In case of conflict, <i>git rebase</i> will stop at the first
    problematic commit and leave conflict markers in the tree. You can use
    <i>git diff</i> to locate the markers (&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;) and make
    edits to resolve the conflict. For each file you edit, you need to tell Git
    that the conflict has been resolved, typically this would be done with</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
git add &lt;filename&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">After resolving the conflict manually and updating the index with
    the desired resolution, you can continue the rebasing process with</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
git rebase --continue
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Alternatively, you can undo the <i>git rebase</i> with</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
git rebase --abort
</pre>
</div>

<h1 class="Sh" id="CONFIGURATION"><a class="permalink" href="#CONFIGURATION">CONFIGURATION</a></h1>
rebase.useBuiltin
<div class="Bd-indent">Unused configuration variable. Used in Git versions 2.20
  and 2.21 as an escape hatch to enable the legacy shellscript implementation of
  rebase. Now the built-in rewrite of it in C is always used. Setting this will
  emit a warning, to alert any remaining users that setting this now does
  nothing.</div>
<p class="Pp">rebase.backend</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Default backend to use for rebasing. Possible choices are
  <i>apply</i> or <i>merge</i>. In the future, if the merge backend gains all
  remaining capabilities of the apply backend, this setting may become
  unused.</div>
<p class="Pp">rebase.stat</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Whether to show a diffstat of what changed upstream since
  the last rebase. False by default.</div>
<p class="Pp">rebase.autoSquash</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If set to true enable <b>--autosquash</b> option by
  default.</div>
<p class="Pp">rebase.autoStash</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When set to true, automatically create a temporary stash
  entry before the operation begins, and apply it after the operation ends. This
  means that you can run rebase on a dirty worktree. However, use with care: the
  final stash application after a successful rebase might result in non-trivial
  conflicts. This option can be overridden by the <b>--no-autostash</b> and
  <b>--autostash</b> options of <b>git-rebase</b>(1). Defaults to false.</div>
<p class="Pp">rebase.missingCommitsCheck</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If set to &quot;warn&quot;, git rebase -i will print a
  warning if some commits are removed (e.g. a line was deleted), however the
  rebase will still proceed. If set to &quot;error&quot;, it will print the
  previous warning and stop the rebase, <i>git rebase --edit-todo</i> can then
  be used to correct the error. If set to &quot;ignore&quot;, no checking is
  done. To drop a commit without warning or error, use the <b>drop</b> command
  in the todo list. Defaults to &quot;ignore&quot;.</div>
<p class="Pp">rebase.instructionFormat</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A format string, as specified in <b>git-log</b>(1), to be
  used for the todo list during an interactive rebase. The format will
  automatically have the long commit hash prepended to the format.</div>
<p class="Pp">rebase.abbreviateCommands</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If set to true, <b>git rebase</b> will use abbreviated
  command names in the todo list resulting in something like this:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
        p deadbee The oneline of the commit
        p fa1afe1 The oneline of the next commit
        ...
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">instead of:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
        pick deadbee The oneline of the commit
        pick fa1afe1 The oneline of the next commit
        ...
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Defaults to false.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">rebase.rescheduleFailedExec</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Automatically reschedule <b>exec</b> commands that
  failed. This only makes sense in interactive mode (or when an <b>--exec</b>
  option was provided). This is the same as specifying the
  <b>--reschedule-failed-exec</b> option.</div>
<p class="Pp">sequence.editor</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Text editor used by <b>git rebase -i</b> for editing the
  rebase instruction file. The value is meant to be interpreted by the shell
  when it is used. It can be overridden by the <b>GIT_SEQUENCE_EDITOR</b>
  environment variable. When not configured the default commit message editor is
  used instead.</div>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
--onto &lt;newbase&gt;
<div class="Bd-indent">Starting point at which to create the new commits. If the
  --onto option is not specified, the starting point is &lt;upstream&gt;. May be
  any valid commit, and not just an existing branch name.
<p class="Pp">As a special case, you may use &quot;A...B&quot; as a shortcut for
    the merge base of A and B if there is exactly one merge base. You can leave
    out at most one of A and B, in which case it defaults to HEAD.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--keep-base</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Set the starting point at which to create the new commits
  to the merge base of &lt;upstream&gt; &lt;branch&gt;. Running <i>git rebase
  --keep-base &lt;upstream&gt; &lt;branch&gt;</i> is equivalent to running
  <i>git rebase --onto &lt;upstream&gt;... &lt;upstream&gt;</i>.
<p class="Pp">This option is useful in the case where one is developing a
    feature on top of an upstream branch. While the feature is being worked on,
    the upstream branch may advance and it may not be the best idea to keep
    rebasing on top of the upstream but to keep the base commit as-is.</p>
<p class="Pp">Although both this option and --fork-point find the merge base
    between &lt;upstream&gt; and &lt;branch&gt;, this option uses the merge base
    as the <i>starting point</i> on which new commits will be created, whereas
    --fork-point uses the merge base to determine the <i>set of commits</i>
    which will be rebased.</p>
<p class="Pp">See also INCOMPATIBLE OPTIONS below.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">&lt;upstream&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Upstream branch to compare against. May be any valid
  commit, not just an existing branch name. Defaults to the configured upstream
  for the current branch.</div>
<p class="Pp">&lt;branch&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Working branch; defaults to HEAD.</div>
<p class="Pp">--continue</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Restart the rebasing process after having resolved a
  merge conflict.</div>
<p class="Pp">--abort</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Abort the rebase operation and reset HEAD to the original
  branch. If &lt;branch&gt; was provided when the rebase operation was started,
  then HEAD will be reset to &lt;branch&gt;. Otherwise HEAD will be reset to
  where it was when the rebase operation was started.</div>
<p class="Pp">--quit</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Abort the rebase operation but HEAD is not reset back to
  the original branch. The index and working tree are also left unchanged as a
  result. If a temporary stash entry was created using --autostash, it will be
  saved to the stash list.</div>
<p class="Pp">--apply</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Use applying strategies to rebase (calling <b>git-am</b>
  internally). This option may become a no-op in the future once the merge
  backend handles everything the apply one does.
<p class="Pp">See also INCOMPATIBLE OPTIONS below.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--empty={drop,keep,ask}</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">How to handle commits that are not empty to start and are
  not clean cherry-picks of any upstream commit, but which become empty after
  rebasing (because they contain a subset of already upstream changes). With
  drop (the default), commits that become empty are dropped. With keep, such
  commits are kept. With ask (implied by --interactive), the rebase will halt
  when an empty commit is applied allowing you to choose whether to drop it,
  edit files more, or just commit the empty changes. Other options, like --exec,
  will use the default of drop unless -i/--interactive is explicitly specified.
<p class="Pp">Note that commits which start empty are kept (unless
    --no-keep-empty is specified), and commits which are clean cherry-picks (as
    determined by <b>git log --cherry-mark ...</b>) are detected and dropped as
    a preliminary step (unless --reapply-cherry-picks is passed).</p>
<p class="Pp">See also INCOMPATIBLE OPTIONS below.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--no-keep-empty, --keep-empty</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Do not keep commits that start empty before the rebase
  (i.e. that do not change anything from its parent) in the result. The default
  is to keep commits which start empty, since creating such commits requires
  passing the --allow-empty override flag to <b>git commit</b>, signifying that
  a user is very intentionally creating such a commit and thus wants to keep it.
<p class="Pp">Usage of this flag will probably be rare, since you can get rid of
    commits that start empty by just firing up an interactive rebase and
    removing the lines corresponding to the commits you don&#x2019;t want. This
    flag exists as a convenient shortcut, such as for cases where external tools
    generate many empty commits and you want them all removed.</p>
<p class="Pp">For commits which do not start empty but become empty after
    rebasing, see the --empty flag.</p>
<p class="Pp">See also INCOMPATIBLE OPTIONS below.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--reapply-cherry-picks, --no-reapply-cherry-picks</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Reapply all clean cherry-picks of any upstream commit
  instead of preemptively dropping them. (If these commits then become empty
  after rebasing, because they contain a subset of already upstream changes, the
  behavior towards them is controlled by the <b>--empty</b> flag.)
<p class="Pp">By default (or if <b>--no-reapply-cherry-picks</b> is given),
    these commits will be automatically dropped. Because this necessitates
    reading all upstream commits, this can be expensive in repos with a large
    number of upstream commits that need to be read.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>--reapply-cherry-picks</b> allows rebase to forgo reading all
    upstream commits, potentially improving performance.</p>
<p class="Pp">See also INCOMPATIBLE OPTIONS below.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--allow-empty-message</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">No-op. Rebasing commits with an empty message used to
  fail and this option would override that behavior, allowing commits with empty
  messages to be rebased. Now commits with an empty message do not cause
  rebasing to halt.
<p class="Pp">See also INCOMPATIBLE OPTIONS below.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--skip</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Restart the rebasing process by skipping the current
  patch.</div>
<p class="Pp">--edit-todo</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Edit the todo list during an interactive rebase.</div>
<p class="Pp">--show-current-patch</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show the current patch in an interactive rebase or when
  rebase is stopped because of conflicts. This is the equivalent of <b>git show
  REBASE_HEAD</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">-m, --merge</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Use merging strategies to rebase. When the recursive
  (default) merge strategy is used, this allows rebase to be aware of renames on
  the upstream side. This is the default.
<p class="Pp">Note that a rebase merge works by replaying each commit from the
    working branch on top of the &lt;upstream&gt; branch. Because of this, when
    a merge conflict happens, the side reported as <i>ours</i> is the so-far
    rebased series, starting with &lt;upstream&gt;, and <i>theirs</i> is the
    working branch. In other words, the sides are swapped.</p>
<p class="Pp">See also INCOMPATIBLE OPTIONS below.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">-s &lt;strategy&gt;, --strategy=&lt;strategy&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Use the given merge strategy. If there is no <b>-s</b>
  option <i>git merge-recursive</i> is used instead. This implies --merge.
<p class="Pp">Because <i>git rebase</i> replays each commit from the working
    branch on top of the &lt;upstream&gt; branch using the given strategy, using
    the <i>ours</i> strategy simply empties all patches from the &lt;branch&gt;,
    which makes little sense.</p>
<p class="Pp">See also INCOMPATIBLE OPTIONS below.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">-X &lt;strategy-option&gt;,
    --strategy-option=&lt;strategy-option&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Pass the &lt;strategy-option&gt; through to the merge
  strategy. This implies <b>--merge</b> and, if no strategy has been specified,
  <b>-s recursive</b>. Note the reversal of <i>ours</i> and <i>theirs</i> as
  noted above for the <b>-m</b> option.
<p class="Pp">See also INCOMPATIBLE OPTIONS below.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--rerere-autoupdate, --no-rerere-autoupdate</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Allow the rerere mechanism to update the index with the
  result of auto-conflict resolution if possible.</div>
<p class="Pp">-S[&lt;keyid&gt;], --gpg-sign[=&lt;keyid&gt;], --no-gpg-sign</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">GPG-sign commits. The <b>keyid</b> argument is optional
  and defaults to the committer identity; if specified, it must be stuck to the
  option without a space. <b>--no-gpg-sign</b> is useful to countermand both
  <b>commit.gpgSign</b> configuration variable, and earlier
  <b>--gpg-sign</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">-q, --quiet</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Be quiet. Implies --no-stat.</div>
<p class="Pp">-v, --verbose</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Be verbose. Implies --stat.</div>
<p class="Pp">--stat</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show a diffstat of what changed upstream since the last
  rebase. The diffstat is also controlled by the configuration option
  rebase.stat.</div>
<p class="Pp">-n, --no-stat</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Do not show a diffstat as part of the rebase
  process.</div>
<p class="Pp">--no-verify</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This option bypasses the pre-rebase hook. See also
  <b>githooks</b>(5).</div>
<p class="Pp">--verify</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Allows the pre-rebase hook to run, which is the default.
  This option can be used to override --no-verify. See also

<h1 class="Sh" id="BEHAVIORAL_DIFFERENCES"><a class="permalink" href="#BEHAVIORAL_DIFFERENCES">BEHAVIORAL
  DIFFERENCES</a></h1>
git rebase has two primary backends: apply and merge. (The apply backend used to
  be known as the <i>am</i> backend, but the name led to confusion as it looks
  like a verb instead of a noun. Also, the merge backend used to be known as the
  interactive backend, but it is now used for non-interactive cases as well.
  Both were renamed based on lower-level functionality that underpinned each.)
  There are some subtle differences in how these two backends behave:
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Empty_commits"><a class="permalink" href="#Empty_commits">Empty
  commits</a></h2>
The apply backend unfortunately drops intentionally empty commits, i.e. commits
  that started empty, though these are rare in practice. It also drops commits
  that become empty and has no option for controlling this behavior.
<p class="Pp">The merge backend keeps intentionally empty commits by default
    (though with -i they are marked as empty in the todo list editor, or they
    can be dropped automatically with --no-keep-empty).</p>
<p class="Pp">Similar to the apply backend, by default the merge backend drops
    commits that become empty unless -i/--interactive is specified (in which
    case it stops and asks the user what to do). The merge backend also has an
    --empty={drop,keep,ask} option for changing the behavior of handling commits
    that become empty.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Directory_rename_detection"><a class="permalink" href="#Directory_rename_detection">Directory
  rename detection</a></h2>
Due to the lack of accurate tree information (arising from constructing fake
  ancestors with the limited information available in patches), directory rename
  detection is disabled in the apply backend. Disabled directory rename
  detection means that if one side of history renames a directory and the other
  adds new files to the old directory, then the new files will be left behind in
  the old directory without any warning at the time of rebasing that you may
  want to move these files into the new directory.
<p class="Pp">Directory rename detection works with the merge backend to provide
    you warnings in such cases.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Context"><a class="permalink" href="#Context">Context</a></h2>
The apply backend works by creating a sequence of patches (by calling
  <b>format-patch</b> internally), and then applying the patches in sequence
  (calling <b>am</b> internally). Patches are composed of multiple hunks, each
  with line numbers, a context region, and the actual changes. The line numbers
  have to be taken with some fuzz, since the other side will likely have
  inserted or deleted lines earlier in the file. The context region is meant to
  help find how to adjust the line numbers in order to apply the changes to the
  right lines. However, if multiple areas of the code have the same surrounding
  lines of context, the wrong one can be picked. There are real-world cases
  where this has caused commits to be reapplied incorrectly with no conflicts
  reported. Setting diff.context to a larger value may prevent such types of
  problems, but increases the chance of spurious conflicts (since it will
  require more lines of matching context to apply).
<p class="Pp">The merge backend works with a full copy of each relevant file,
    insulating it from these types of problems.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Labelling_of_conflicts_markers"><a class="permalink" href="#Labelling_of_conflicts_markers">Labelling
  of conflicts markers</a></h2>
When there are content conflicts, the merge machinery tries to annotate each
  side&#x2019;s conflict markers with the commits where the content came from.
  Since the apply backend drops the original information about the rebased
  commits and their parents (and instead generates new fake commits based off
  limited information in the generated patches), those commits cannot be
  identified; instead it has to fall back to a commit summary. Also, when
  merge.conflictStyle is set to diff3, the apply backend will use
  &quot;constructed merge base&quot; to label the content from the merge base,
  and thus provide no information about the merge base commit whatsoever.
<p class="Pp">The merge backend works with the full commits on both sides of
    history and thus has no such limitations.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Hooks"><a class="permalink" href="#Hooks">Hooks</a></h2>
The apply backend has not traditionally called the post-commit hook, while the
  merge backend has. Both have called the post-checkout hook, though the merge
  backend has squelched its output. Further, both backends only call the
  post-checkout hook with the starting point commit of the rebase, not the
  intermediate commits nor the final commit. In each case, the calling of these
  hooks was by accident of implementation rather than by design (both backends
  were originally implemented as shell scripts and happened to invoke other
  commands like <i>git checkout</i> or <i>git commit</i> that would call the
  hooks). Both backends should have the same behavior, though it is not entirely
  clear which, if any, is correct. We will likely make rebase stop calling
  either of these hooks in the future.
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Interruptability"><a class="permalink" href="#Interruptability">Interruptability</a></h2>
The apply backend has safety problems with an ill-timed interrupt; if the user
  presses Ctrl-C at the wrong time to try to abort the rebase, the rebase can
  enter a state where it cannot be aborted with a subsequent <b>git rebase
  --abort</b>. The merge backend does not appear to suffer from the same
  shortcoming. (See
  <b>https://lore.kernel.org/git/20200207132152.GC2868@szeder.dev/</b> for
  details.)
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Commit_Rewording"><a class="permalink" href="#Commit_Rewording">Commit
  Rewording</a></h2>
When a conflict occurs while rebasing, rebase stops and asks the user to
  resolve. Since the user may need to make notable changes while resolving
  conflicts, after conflicts are resolved and the user has run <b>git rebase
  --continue</b>, the rebase should open an editor and ask the user to update
  the commit message. The merge backend does this, while the apply backend
  blindly applies the original commit message.

<h2 class="Ss" id="Miscellaneous_differences"><a class="permalink" href="#Miscellaneous_differences">Miscellaneous

There are a few more behavioral differences that most folks would probably
  consider inconsequential but which are mentioned for completeness:

<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Reflog: The two backends will use different

<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Progress, informational, and error messages: The

<h1 class="Sh" id="MERGE_STRATEGIES"><a class="permalink" href="#MERGE_STRATEGIES">MERGE
  STRATEGIES</a></h1>
The merge mechanism (<b>git merge</b> and <b>git pull</b> commands) allows the
  backend <i>merge strategies</i> to be chosen with <b>-s</b> option. Some
  strategies can also take their own options, which can be passed by giving
  <b>-X&lt;option&gt;</b> arguments to <b>git merge</b> and/or <b>git pull</b>.
<p class="Pp">resolve</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This can only resolve two heads (i.e. the current branch

  carefully detect criss-cross merge ambiguities and is considered generally
  safe and fast.</div>
<p class="Pp">recursive</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This can only resolve two heads using a 3-way merge
  algorithm. When there is more than one common ancestor that can be used for
  3-way merge, it creates a merged tree of the common ancestors and uses that as
  the reference tree for the 3-way merge. This has been reported to result in
  fewer merge conflicts without causing mismerges by tests done on actual merge
  commits taken from Linux 2.6 kernel development history. Additionally this can
  detect and handle merges involving renames, but currently cannot make use of
  detected copies. This is the default merge strategy when pulling or merging
  one branch.
<p class="Pp">The <i>recursive</i> strategy can take the following options:</p>
<p class="Pp">ours</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This option forces conflicting hunks to be auto-resolved

<p class="Pp">This should not be confused with the <i>ours</i> merge strategy,
    which does not even look at what the other tree contains at all. It discards

  tree structure of A, instead of reading the trees at the same level. This
  adjustment is also done to the common ancestor tree.</div>
<p class="Pp">With the strategies that use 3-way merge (including the default,
    <i>recursive</i>), if a change is made on both branches, but later reverted
    on one of the branches, that change will be present in the merged result;
    some people find this behavior confusing. It occurs because only the heads
    and the merge base are considered when performing a merge, not the
    individual commits. The merge algorithm therefore considers the reverted
    change as no change at all, and substitutes the changed version instead.</p>

You should understand the implications of using <i>git rebase</i> on a
  repository that you share. See also RECOVERING FROM UPSTREAM REBASE below.
<p class="Pp">When the git-rebase command is run, it will first execute a
    &quot;pre-rebase&quot; hook if one exists. You can use this hook to do
    sanity checks and reject the rebase if it isn&#x2019;t appropriate. Please
    see the template pre-rebase hook script for an example.</p>
<p class="Pp">Upon completion, &lt;branch&gt; will be the current branch.</p>

  MODE</a></h1>
Rebasing interactively means that you have a chance to edit the commits which
  are rebased. You can reorder the commits, and you can remove them (weeding out
  bad or otherwise unwanted patches).
<p class="Pp">The interactive mode is meant for this type of workflow:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 1.have a wonderful idea</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 2.hack on the code</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 3.prepare a series for submission</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 4.submit</div>
<p class="Pp">where point 2. consists of several instances of</p>
<p class="Pp">a) regular use</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 1.finish something worthy of a commit</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 2.commit</div>
<p class="Pp">b) independent fixup</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 1.realize that something does not work</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 2.fix that</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 3.commit it</div>
<p class="Pp">Sometimes the thing fixed in b.2. cannot be amended to the
    not-quite perfect commit it fixes, because that commit is buried deeply in a
    patch series. That is exactly what interactive rebase is for: use it after
    plenty of &quot;a&quot;s and &quot;b&quot;s, by rearranging and editing
    commits, and squashing multiple commits into one.</p>
<p class="Pp">Start it with the last commit you want to retain as-is:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
git rebase -i &lt;after-this-commit&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">An editor will be fired up with all the commits in your current
    branch (ignoring merge commits), which come after the given commit. You can
    reorder the commits in this list to your heart&#x2019;s content, and you can
    remove them. The list looks more or less like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
pick deadbee The oneline of this commit
pick fa1afe1 The oneline of the next commit
...
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">The oneline descriptions are purely for your pleasure; <i>git
    rebase</i> will not look at them but at the commit names
    (&quot;deadbee&quot; and &quot;fa1afe1&quot; in this example), so do not
    delete or edit the names.</p>
<p class="Pp">By replacing the command &quot;pick&quot; with the command
    &quot;edit&quot;, you can tell <i>git rebase</i> to stop after applying that
    commit, so that you can edit the files and/or the commit message, amend the
    commit, and continue rebasing.</p>
<p class="Pp">To interrupt the rebase (just like an &quot;edit&quot; command
    would do, but without cherry-picking any commit first), use the
    &quot;break&quot; command.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you just want to edit the commit message for a commit, replace
    the command &quot;pick&quot; with the command &quot;reword&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">To drop a commit, replace the command &quot;pick&quot; with
    &quot;drop&quot;, or just delete the matching line.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you want to fold two or more commits into one, replace the
    command &quot;pick&quot; for the second and subsequent commits with
    &quot;squash&quot; or &quot;fixup&quot;. If the commits had different
    authors, the folded commit will be attributed to the author of the first
    commit. The suggested commit message for the folded commit is the
    concatenation of the commit messages of the first commit and of those with
    the &quot;squash&quot; command, but omits the commit messages of commits
    with the &quot;fixup&quot; command.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>git rebase</i> will stop when &quot;pick&quot; has been
    replaced with &quot;edit&quot; or when a command fails due to merge errors.
    When you are done editing and/or resolving conflicts you can continue with
    <b>git rebase --continue</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, if you want to reorder the last 5 commits, such that
    what was HEAD~4 becomes the new HEAD. To achieve that, you would call <i>git
    rebase</i> like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ git rebase -i HEAD~5
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">And move the first patch to the end of the list.</p>
<p class="Pp">You might want to recreate merge commits, e.g. if you have a
    history like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
           X
            \
         A---M---B
        /
---o---O---P---Q
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">Suppose you want to rebase the side branch starting at
    &quot;A&quot; to &quot;Q&quot;. Make sure that the current HEAD is
    &quot;B&quot;, and call</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ git rebase -i -r --onto Q O
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">Reordering and editing commits usually creates untested
    intermediate steps. You may want to check that your history editing did not
    break anything by running a test, or at least recompiling at intermediate
    points in history by using the &quot;exec&quot; command (shortcut
    &quot;x&quot;). You may do so by creating a todo list like this one:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
pick deadbee Implement feature XXX
fixup f1a5c00 Fix to feature XXX
exec make
pick c0ffeee The oneline of the next commit
edit deadbab The oneline of the commit after
exec cd subdir; make test
...
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">The interactive rebase will stop when a command fails (i.e. exits
    with non-0 status) to give you an opportunity to fix the problem. You can
    continue with <b>git rebase --continue</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The &quot;exec&quot; command launches the command in a shell (the
    one specified in <b>$SHELL</b>, or the default shell if <b>$SHELL</b> is not
    set), so you can use shell features (like &quot;cd&quot;, &quot;&gt;&quot;,
    &quot;;&quot; ...). The command is run from the root of the working
  tree.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ git rebase -i --exec &quot;make test&quot;
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">This command lets you check that intermediate commits are
    compilable. The todo list becomes like that:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
pick 5928aea one
exec make test
pick 04d0fda two
exec make test
pick ba46169 three
exec make test
pick f4593f9 four
exec make test

In interactive mode, you can mark commits with the action &quot;edit&quot;.
  However, this does not necessarily mean that <i>git rebase</i> expects the
  result of this edit to be exactly one commit. Indeed, you can undo the commit,
  or you can add other commits. This can be used to split a commit into two:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Start an interactive rebase with <b>git rebase -i
  &lt;commit&gt;^</b>, where &lt;commit&gt; is the commit you want to split. In
  fact, any commit range will do, as long as it contains that commit.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Mark the commit you want to split with the action
  &quot;edit&quot;.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;When it comes to editing that commit, execute
  <b>git reset HEAD^</b>. The effect is that the HEAD is rewound by one, and the
  index follows suit. However, the working tree stays the same.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Now add the changes to the index that you want to
  have in the first commit. You can use <b>git add</b> (possibly interactively)
  or <i>git gui</i> (or both) to do that.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Commit the now-current index with whatever commit
  message is appropriate now.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Repeat the last two steps until your working tree
  is clean.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Continue the rebase with <b>git rebase
  --continue</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">If you are not absolutely sure that the intermediate revisions are
    consistent (they compile, pass the testsuite, etc.) you should use <i>git
    stash</i> to stash away the not-yet-committed changes after each commit,
    test, and amend the commit if fixes are necessary.</p>

  FROM UPSTREAM REBASE</a></h1>
Rebasing (or any other form of rewriting) a branch that others have based work
  on is a bad idea: anyone downstream of it is forced to manually fix their
  history. This section explains how to do the fix from the downstream&#x2019;s
  point of view. The real fix, however, would be to avoid rebasing the upstream
  in the first place.
<p class="Pp">To illustrate, suppose you are in a situation where someone
    develops a <i>subsystem</i> branch, and you are working on a <i>topic</i>
    that is dependent on this <i>subsystem</i>. You might end up with a history
    like the following:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
    o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o  master
         \
          o---o---o---o---o  subsystem
                           \
                            *---*---*  topic
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">If <i>subsystem</i> is rebased against <i>master</i>, the
    following happens:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
    o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o  master
         \                       \
          o---o---o---o---o       o'--o'--o'--o'--o'  subsystem
                           \
                            *---*---*  topic
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">If you now continue development as usual, and eventually merge
    <i>topic</i> to <i>subsystem</i>, the commits from <i>subsystem</i> will
    remain duplicated forever:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
    o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o  master
         \                       \
          o---o---o---o---o       o'--o'--o'--o'--o'--M  subsystem
                           \                         /
                            *---*---*-..........-*--*  topic
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">Such duplicates are generally frowned upon because they clutter up
    history, making it harder to follow. To clean things up, you need to
    transplant the commits on <i>topic</i> to the new <i>subsystem</i> tip,
    i.e., rebase <i>topic</i>. This becomes a ripple effect: anyone downstream
    from <i>topic</i> is forced to rebase too, and so on!</p>
<p class="Pp">There are two kinds of fixes, discussed in the following
    subsections:</p>
<p class="Pp">Easy case: The changes are literally the same.</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This happens if the <i>subsystem</i> rebase was a simple
  rebase and had no conflicts.</div>
<p class="Pp">Hard case: The changes are not the same.</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This happens if the <i>subsystem</i> rebase had
  conflicts, or used <b>--interactive</b> to omit, edit, squash, or fixup
  commits; or if the upstream used one of <b>commit --amend</b>, <b>reset</b>,
  or a full history rewriting command like <b></b><b>filter-repo</b>[2].</div>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="The_easy_case"><a class="permalink" href="#The_easy_case">The
  easy case</a></h2>
Only works if the changes (patch IDs based on the diff contents) on
  <i>subsystem</i> are literally the same before and after the rebase
  <i>subsystem</i> did.
<p class="Pp">In that case, the fix is easy because <i>git rebase</i> knows to
    skip changes that are already present in the new upstream (unless
    <b>--reapply-cherry-picks</b> is given). So if you say (assuming
    you&#x2019;re on <i>topic</i>)</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
    $ git rebase subsystem

<p class="Pp">you will end up with the fixed history</p>

Things get more complicated if the <i>subsystem</i> changes do not exactly

<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<br/>
<b>Note</b>
<p class="Pp">While an &quot;easy case recovery&quot; sometimes appears to be
    successful even in the hard case, it may have unintended consequences. For
    example, a commit that was removed via <b>git rebase --interactive</b> will
    be <b>resurrected</b>!</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The idea is to manually tell <i>git rebase</i> &quot;where the old
    <i>subsystem</i> ended and your <i>topic</i> began&quot;, that is, what the
    old merge base between them was. You will have to find a way to name the
    last commit of the old <i>subsystem</i>, for example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;With the <i>subsystem</i> reflog: after <i>git
  fetch</i>, the old tip of <i>subsystem</i> is at <b>subsystem@{1}</b>.
  Subsequent fetches will increase the number. (See <b>git-reflog</b>(1).)</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Relative to the tip of <i>topic</i>: knowing that
  your <i>topic</i> has three commits, the old tip of <i>subsystem</i> must be
  <b>topic~3</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">You can then transplant the old <b>subsystem..topic</b> to the new
    tip by saying (for the reflog case, and assuming you are on <i>topic</i>
    already):</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
    $ git rebase --onto subsystem subsystem@{1}
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">The ripple effect of a &quot;hard case&quot; recovery is
    especially bad: <i>everyone</i> downstream from <i>topic</i> will now have
    to perform a &quot;hard case&quot; recovery too!</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="REBASING_MERGES"><a class="permalink" href="#REBASING_MERGES">REBASING
  MERGES</a></h1>
The interactive rebase command was originally designed to handle individual
  patch series. As such, it makes sense to exclude merge commits from the todo
  list, as the developer may have merged the then-current <b>master</b> while
  working on the branch, only to rebase all the commits onto <b>master</b>
  eventually (skipping the merge commits).
<p class="Pp">However, there are legitimate reasons why a developer may want to
    recreate merge commits: to keep the branch structure (or &quot;commit
    topology&quot;) when working on multiple, inter-related branches.</p>
<p class="Pp">In the following example, the developer works on a topic branch
    that refactors the way buttons are defined, and on another topic branch that
    uses that refactoring to implement a &quot;Report a bug&quot; button. The
    output of <b>git log --graph --format=%s -5</b> may look like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
*   Merge branch 'report-a-bug'
|\
| * Add the feedback button
* | Merge branch 'refactor-button'
|\ \
| |/
| * Use the Button class for all buttons
| * Extract a generic Button class from the DownloadButton one
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">The developer might want to rebase those commits to a newer
    <b>master</b> while keeping the branch topology, for example when the first
    topic branch is expected to be integrated into <b>master</b> much earlier
    than the second one, say, to resolve merge conflicts with changes to the
    DownloadButton class that made it into <b>master</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">This rebase can be performed using the <b>--rebase-merges</b>
    option. It will generate a todo list looking like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
label onto
# Branch: refactor-button
reset onto
pick 123456 Extract a generic Button class from the DownloadButton one
pick 654321 Use the Button class for all buttons
label refactor-button
# Branch: report-a-bug
reset refactor-button # Use the Button class for all buttons
pick abcdef Add the feedback button
label report-a-bug
reset onto
merge -C a1b2c3 refactor-button # Merge 'refactor-button'
merge -C 6f5e4d report-a-bug # Merge 'report-a-bug'
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">In contrast to a regular interactive rebase, there are
    <b>label</b>, <b>reset</b> and <b>merge</b> commands in addition to
    <b>pick</b> ones.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>label</b> command associates a label with the current HEAD
    when that command is executed. These labels are created as worktree-local
    refs (<b>refs/rewritten/&lt;label&gt;</b>) that will be deleted when the
    rebase finishes. That way, rebase operations in multiple worktrees linked to
    the same repository do not interfere with one another. If the <b>label</b>
    command fails, it is rescheduled immediately, with a helpful message how to
    proceed.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>reset</b> command resets the HEAD, index and worktree to
    the specified revision. It is similar to an <b>exec git reset --hard
    &lt;label&gt;</b>, but refuses to overwrite untracked files. If the
    <b>reset</b> command fails, it is rescheduled immediately, with a helpful
    message how to edit the todo list (this typically happens when a
    <b>reset</b> command was inserted into the todo list manually and contains a
    typo).</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>merge</b> command will merge the specified revision(s) into
    whatever is HEAD at that time. With <b>-C &lt;original-commit&gt;</b>, the
    commit message of the specified merge commit will be used. When the
    <b>-C</b> is changed to a lower-case <b>-c</b>, the message will be opened
    in an editor after a successful merge so that the user can edit the
  message.</p>
<p class="Pp">If a <b>merge</b> command fails for any reason other than merge
    conflicts (i.e. when the merge operation did not even start), it is
    rescheduled immediately.</p>
<p class="Pp">At this time, the <b>merge</b> command will <b>always</b> use the
    <b>recursive</b> merge strategy for regular merges, and <b>octopus</b> for
    octopus merges, with no way to choose a different one. To work around this,
    an <b>exec</b> command can be used to call <b>git merge</b> explicitly,
    using the fact that the labels are worktree-local refs (the ref
    <b>refs/rewritten/onto</b> would correspond to the label <b>onto</b>, for
    example).</p>
<p class="Pp">Note: the first command (<b>label onto</b>) labels the revision
    onto which the commits are rebased; The name <b>onto</b> is just a
    convention, as a nod to the <b>--onto</b> option.</p>
<p class="Pp">It is also possible to introduce completely new merge commits from
    scratch by adding a command of the form <b>merge &lt;merge-head&gt;</b>.
    This form will generate a tentative commit message and always open an editor
    to let the user edit it. This can be useful e.g. when a topic branch turns
    out to address more than a single concern and wants to be split into two or
    even more topic branches. Consider this todo list:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
pick 192837 Switch from GNU Makefiles to CMake
pick 5a6c7e Document the switch to CMake
pick 918273 Fix detection of OpenSSL in CMake
pick afbecd http: add support for TLS v1.3
pick fdbaec Fix detection of cURL in CMake on Windows
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">The one commit in this list that is not related to CMake may very
    well have been motivated by working on fixing all those bugs introduced by
    switching to CMake, but it addresses a different concern. To split this
    branch into two topic branches, the todo list could be edited like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
label onto
pick afbecd http: add support for TLS v1.3

The todo list presented by the deprecated <b>--preserve-merges --interactive</b>
