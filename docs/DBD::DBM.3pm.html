DBD::DBM is a database management system that works right out of the box. If you
  have a standard installation of Perl and DBI you can begin creating,
  accessing, and modifying simple database tables without any further modules.
  You can add other modules (e.g., SQL::Statement, DB_File etc) for improved
  functionality.
<p class="Pp">The module uses a DBM file storage layer. DBM file storage is
    common on many platforms and files can be created with it in many
    programming languages using different APIs. That means, in addition to
    creating files with DBI/SQL, you can also use DBI/SQL to access and modify
    files created by other DBM modules and programs and vice versa. <b>Note</b>
    that in those cases it might be necessary to use a common subset of the
    provided features.</p>
<p class="Pp">DBM files are stored in binary format optimized for quick
    retrieval when using a key field. That optimization can be used
    advantageously to make DBD::DBM SQL operations that use key fields very
    fast. There are several different &quot;flavors&quot; of DBM which use
    different storage formats supported by perl modules such as SDBM_File and
    MLDBM. This module supports all of the flavors that perl supports and, when
    used with MLDBM, supports tables with any number of columns and insertion of
    Perl objects into tables.</p>
<p class="Pp">DBD::DBM has been tested with the following DBM types: SDBM_File,
    NDBM_File, ODBM_File, GDBM_File, DB_File, BerkeleyDB. Each type was tested
    both with and without MLDBM and with the Data::Dumper, Storable, FreezeThaw,
    YAML and JSON serializers using the DBI::SQL::Nano or the SQL::Statement
    engines.</p>

DBD::DBM operates like all other DBD drivers - it's basic syntax and operation
  is specified by DBI. If you're not familiar with DBI, you should start by
  reading DBI and the documents it points to and then come back and read this
  file. If you are familiar with DBI, you already know most of what you need to
  know to operate this module. Just jump in and create a test script something
  like the one shown below.
<p class="Pp">You should be aware that there are several options for the SQL
    engine underlying DBD::DBM, see &quot;Supported SQL syntax&quot;. There are
    also many options for DBM support, see especially the section on
    &quot;Adding multi-column support with MLDBM&quot;.</p>

DBD::DBM will automatically supply an appropriate file extension for the type of
  DBM you are using. For example, if you use SDBM_File, a table called
  &quot;fruit&quot; will be stored in two files called &quot;fruit.pag&quot; and
  &quot;fruit.dir&quot;. You should <b>never</b> specify the file extensions in
  your SQL statements.
<p class="Pp">DBD::DBM recognizes following default extensions for following
    types:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>.pag/r</dt>
  <dd>Chosen for dbm_type <span class="Li">&quot;SDBM_File&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;ODBM_File&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;NDBM_File&quot;</span> when an implementation is
      detected which wraps <span class="Li">&quot;-ldbm&quot;</span> for
      <span class="Li">&quot;NDBM_File&quot;</span> (e.g. Solaris, AIX, ...).
    <p class="Pp">For those types, the <span class="Li">&quot;.dir&quot;</span>
        extension is recognized, too (for being deleted when dropping a
      table).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>.db/r</dt>
  <dd>Chosen for dbm_type <span class="Li">&quot;NDBM_File&quot;</span> when an
      implementation is detected which wraps BerkeleyDB 1.x for
      <span class="Li">&quot;NDBM_File&quot;</span> (typically BSD's,
    Darwin).</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;GDBM_File&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;DB_File&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;BerkeleyDB&quot;</span> don't usually use a file
    extension.</p>
<p class="Pp">If your DBM type uses an extension other than one of the
    recognized types of extensions, you should set the <i>f_ext</i> attribute to
    the extension <b>and</b> file a bug report as described in DBI with the name
    of the implementation and extension so we can add it to DBD::DBM. Thanks in
    advance for that :-).</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect('dbi:DBM:f_ext=.db');  # .db extension is used
  $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect('dbi:DBM:f_ext=');     # no extension is used

  $dbh-&gt;{f_meta}-&gt;{'qux'}-&gt;{f_ext}='.db';    # setting for table 'qux'
</pre>
<p class="Pp">By default files are assumed to be in the current working
    directory. To use other directories specify the <i>f_dir</i> attribute in
    either the connect string or by setting the database handle attribute.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, this will look for the file /foo/bar/fruit (or
    /foo/bar/fruit.pag for DBM types that use that extension)</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  my $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect('dbi:DBM:f_dir=/foo/bar');
  # and this will too:
  my $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect('dbi:DBM:');
  $dbh-&gt;{f_dir} = '/foo/bar';
  # but this is recommended
  my $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect('dbi:DBM:', undef, undef, { f_dir =&gt; '/foo/bar' } );

  # now you can do
  my $ary = $dbh-&gt;selectall_arrayref(q{ SELECT x FROM fruit });
</pre>
<p class="Pp">You can also use delimited identifiers to specify paths directly
    in SQL statements. This looks in the same place as the two examples above
    but without setting <i>f_dir</i>:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>

   my $ary = $dbh-&gt;selectall_arrayref(q{
       SELECT x FROM &quot;/foo/bar/fruit&quot;
   });
</pre>
<p class="Pp">You can also tell DBD::DBM to use a specified path for a specific
    table:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  $dbh-&gt;{dbm_tables}-&gt;{f}-&gt;{file} = q(/foo/bar/fruit);
</pre>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Table_locking_and__fBflock()_fP"><a class="permalink" href="#Table_locking_and__fBflock()_fP">Table
  locking and <b>flock()</b></a></h2>
Table locking is accomplished using a lockfile which has the same basename as
  the table's file but with the file extension '.lck' (or a lockfile extension
  that you supply, see below). This lock file is created with the table during a
  CREATE and removed during a DROP. Every time the table itself is opened, the
  lockfile is <b>flocked()</b>. For SELECT, this is a shared lock. For all other
  operations, it is an exclusive lock (except when you specify something
  different using the <i>f_lock</i> attribute).
<p class="Pp">Since the locking depends on <b>flock()</b>, it only works on
    operating systems that support <b>flock()</b>. In cases where <b>flock()</b>
    is not implemented, DBD::DBM will simply behave as if the <b>flock()</b> had
    occurred although no actual locking will happen. Read the documentation for
    <b>flock()</b> for more information.</p>
<p class="Pp">Even on those systems that do support <b>flock()</b>, locking is
    only advisory - as is always the case with <b>flock()</b>. This means that
    if another program tries to access the table file while DBD::DBM has the
    table locked, that other program will *succeed* at opening unless it is also
    using flock on the '.lck' file. As a result DBD::DBM's locking only really
    applies to other programs using DBD::DBM or other program written to
    cooperate with DBD::DBM locking.</p>

Each &quot;flavor&quot; of DBM stores its files in a different format and has
  different capabilities and limitations. See AnyDBM_File for a comparison of
  DBM types.
<p class="Pp">By default, DBD::DBM uses the
    <span class="Li">&quot;SDBM_File&quot;</span> type of storage since
    <span class="Li">&quot;SDBM_File&quot;</span> comes with Perl itself. If you
    have other types of DBM storage available, you can use any of them with
    DBD::DBM. It is strongly recommended to use at least
    <span class="Li">&quot;DB_File&quot;</span>, because
    <span class="Li">&quot;SDBM_File&quot;</span> has quirks and limitations and
    <span class="Li">&quot;ODBM_file&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;NDBM_File&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;GDBM_File&quot;</span> are not always available.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can specify the DBM type using the <i>dbm_type</i> attribute
    which can be set in the connection string or with
    <span class="Li">&quot;$dbh-&gt;{dbm_type}&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;$dbh-&gt;{f_meta}-&gt;{$table_name}-&gt;{type}&quot;</span>
    for per-table settings in cases where a single script is accessing more than
    one kind of DBM file.</p>
<p class="Pp">In the connection string, just set
    <span class="Li">&quot;dbm_type=TYPENAME&quot;</span> where
    <span class="Li">&quot;TYPENAME&quot;</span> is any DBM type such as
    GDBM_File, DB_File, etc. Do <i>not</i> use MLDBM as your <i>dbm_type</i> as
    that is set differently, see below.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
 my $dbh=DBI-&gt;connect('dbi:DBM:');                # uses the default SDBM_File
 my $dbh=DBI-&gt;connect('dbi:DBM:dbm_type=GDBM_File'); # uses the GDBM_File

 # You can also use $dbh-&gt;{dbm_type} to set the DBM type for the connection:
 $dbh-&gt;{dbm_type} = 'DB_File';    # set the global DBM type
 print $dbh-&gt;{dbm_type};          # display the global DBM type
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If you have several tables in your script that use different DBM
    types, you can use the <span class="Li">$dbh</span>-&gt;{dbm_tables} hash to
    store different settings for the various tables. You can even use this to
    perform joins on files that have completely different storage
  mechanisms.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Adding_multi-column_support_with__s-1MLDBM_s0"><a class="permalink" href="#Adding_multi-column_support_with__s-1MLDBM_s0">Adding
  multi-column support with MLDBM</a></h2>
Most of the DBM types only support two columns and even if it would support
  more, DBD::DBM would only use two. However a CPAN module called MLDBM
  overcomes this limitation by allowing more than two columns. MLDBM does this
  by serializing the data - basically it puts a reference to an array into the
  second column. It can also put almost any kind of Perl object or even <b>Perl
  coderefs</b> into columns.
<p class="Pp">If you want more than two columns, you <b>must</b> install MLDBM.
    It's available for many platforms and is easy to install.</p>
<p class="Pp">MLDBM is by default distributed with three serializers -
    Data::Dumper, Storable, and FreezeThaw. Data::Dumper is the default and
    Storable is the fastest. MLDBM can also make use of user-defined
    serialization methods or other serialization modules (e.g. YAML::MLDBM or
    MLDBM::Serializer::JSON. You select the serializer using the
    <i>dbm_mldbm</i> attribute.</p>
<p class="Pp">Some examples:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
 $dbh=DBI-&gt;connect('dbi:DBM:dbm_mldbm=Storable');  # use MLDBM with Storable
 $dbh=DBI-&gt;connect(
    'dbi:DBM:dbm_mldbm=MySerializer' # use MLDBM with a user defined module
 );
 $dbh=DBI-&gt;connect('dbi::dbm:', undef,
     undef, { dbm_mldbm =&gt; 'YAML' }); # use 3rd party serializer
 $dbh-&gt;{dbm_mldbm} = 'YAML'; # same as above
 print $dbh-&gt;{dbm_mldbm} # show the MLDBM serializer
 $dbh-&gt;{f_meta}-&gt;{foo}-&gt;{dbm_mldbm}='Data::Dumper';   # set Data::Dumper for table &quot;foo&quot;
 print $dbh-&gt;{f_meta}-&gt;{foo}-&gt;{mldbm}; # show serializer for table &quot;foo&quot;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">MLDBM works on top of other DBM modules so you can also set a DBM
    type along with setting dbm_mldbm. The examples above would default to using
    SDBM_File with MLDBM. If you wanted GDBM_File instead, here's how:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
 # uses DB_File with MLDBM and Storable
 $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect('dbi:DBM:', undef, undef, {
     dbm_type  =&gt; 'DB_File',
     dbm_mldbm =&gt; 'Storable',
 });
</pre>
<p class="Pp">SDBM_File, the default <i>dbm_type</i> is quite limited, so if you
    are going to use MLDBM, you should probably use a different type, see
    AnyDBM_File.</p>

  MLDBM.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Support_for_Berkeley__s-1DB_s0"><a class="permalink" href="#Support_for_Berkeley__s-1DB_s0">Support
  for Berkeley DB</a></h2>
The Berkeley DB storage type is supported through two different Perl modules -
  DB_File (which supports only features in old versions of Berkeley DB) and
  BerkeleyDB (which supports all versions). DBD::DBM supports specifying either
  &quot;DB_File&quot; or &quot;BerkeleyDB&quot; as a <i>dbm_type</i>, with or
  without MLDBM support.
<p class="Pp">The &quot;BerkeleyDB&quot; dbm_type is experimental and it's
    interface is likely to change. It currently defaults to BerkeleyDB::Hash and
    does not currently support ::Btree or ::Recno.</p>
<p class="Pp">With BerkeleyDB, you can specify initialization flags by setting
    them in your script like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
 use BerkeleyDB;
 my $env = new BerkeleyDB::Env -Home =&gt; $dir;  # and/or other Env flags

     },
 });
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Do <i>not</i> set the -Flags or -Filename flags as those are
    determined and overwritten by the SQL (e.g. -Flags =&gt; DB_RDONLY is set
    automatically when you issue a SELECT statement).</p>
<p class="Pp">Time has not permitted us to provide support in this release of
    DBD::DBM for further Berkeley DB features such as transactions, concurrency,

<h2 class="Ss" id="Optimizing_the_use_of_key_fields"><a class="permalink" href="#Optimizing_the_use_of_key_fields">Optimizing
  the use of key fields</a></h2>
Most &quot;flavors&quot; of DBM have only two physical columns (but can contain
  multiple logical columns as explained above in &quot;Adding multi-column
  support with MLDBM&quot;). They work similarly to a Perl hash with the first
  column serving as the key. Like a Perl hash, DBM files permit you to do quick
  lookups by specifying the key and thus avoid looping through all records
  (supported by DBI::SQL::Nano only). Also like a Perl hash, the keys must be
  unique. It is impossible to create two records with the same key. To put this
  more simply and in SQL terms, the key column functions as the <i>PRIMARY
  KEY</i> or UNIQUE INDEX.
<p class="Pp">In DBD::DBM, you can take advantage of the speed of keyed lookups
    by using DBI::SQL::Nano and a WHERE clause with a single equal comparison on
    the key field. For example, the following SQL statements are optimized for
    keyed lookup:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
 CREATE TABLE user ( user_name TEXT, phone TEXT);
 INSERT INTO user VALUES ('Fred Bloggs','233-7777');
 # ... many more inserts
 SELECT phone FROM user WHERE user_name='Fred Bloggs';
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The &quot;user_name&quot; column is the key column since it is the
    first column. The SELECT statement uses the key column in a single equal
    comparison - &quot;user_name='Fred Bloggs'&quot; - so the search will find
    it very quickly without having to loop through all the names which were
    inserted into the table.</p>
<p class="Pp">In contrast, these searches on the same table are not
  optimized:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
 1. SELECT phone FROM user WHERE user_name &lt; 'Fred';
 2. SELECT user_name FROM user WHERE phone = '233-7777';
</pre>
<p class="Pp">In #1, the operation uses a less-than (&lt;) comparison rather
    than an equals comparison, so it will not be optimized for key searching. In
    #2, the key field &quot;user_name&quot; is not specified in the WHERE
    clause, and therefore the search will need to loop through all rows to find
    the requested row(s).</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Note</b> that the underlying DBM storage needs to loop over all
    <i>key/value</i> pairs when the optimized fetch is used. SQL::Statement has
    a massively improved where clause evaluation which costs around 15% of the
    evaluation in DBI::SQL::Nano - combined with the loop in the DBM storage the

<p class="Pp">Even if lookups are faster by around 50%, DBI::SQL::Nano and
    SQL::Statement can benefit from the key field optimizations on updating and
    deleting rows - and here the improved where clause evaluation of
    SQL::Statement might beat DBI::SQL::Nano every time the where clause
    contains not only the key field (or more than one).</p>

DBD::DBM uses a subset of SQL. The robustness of that subset depends on what
  other modules you have installed. Both options support basic SQL operations
  including CREATE TABLE, DROP TABLE, INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE, and SELECT.
<p class="Pp"><b>Option #1:</b> By default, this module inherits its SQL support
    from DBI::SQL::Nano that comes with DBI. Nano is, as its name implies, a
    *very* small SQL engine. Although limited in scope, it is faster than option
    #2 for some operations (especially single <i>primary key</i> lookups). See
    DBI::SQL::Nano for a description of the SQL it supports and comparisons of
    it with option #2.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Option #2:</b> If you install the pure Perl CPAN module
    SQL::Statement, DBD::DBM will use it instead of Nano. This adds support for
    table aliases, functions, joins, and much more. If you're going to use
    DBD::DBM for anything other than very simple tables and queries, you should
    install SQL::Statement. You don't have to change DBD::DBM or your scripts in
    any way, simply installing SQL::Statement will give you the more robust SQL
    capabilities without breaking scripts written for DBI::SQL::Nano. See
    SQL::Statement for a description of the SQL it supports.</p>
<p class="Pp">To find out which SQL module is working in a given script, you can
    use the <b>dbm_versions()</b> method or, if you don't need the full output
    and version numbers, just do this:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
 print $dbh-&gt;{sql_handler}, &quot;\n&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">That will print out either &quot;SQL::Statement&quot; or
    &quot;DBI::SQL::Nano&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">Baring the section about optimized access to the DBM storage in
    mind, comparing the benefits of both engines:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  # DBI::SQL::Nano is faster
  $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare( &quot;update foo set value='new' where key=15&quot; );

<h2 class="Ss" id="Specifying_Column_Names"><a class="permalink" href="#Specifying_Column_Names">Specifying
  Column Names</a></h2>
DBM files don't have a standard way to store column names. DBD::DBM gets around
  this issue with a DBD::DBM specific way of storing the column names. <b>If you
  are working only with DBD::DBM and not using files created by or</b>
  <b>accessed with other DBM programs, you can ignore this section.</b>
<p class="Pp">DBD::DBM stores column names as a row in the file with the key
    <i>_metadata</i> <i>\0</i>. So this code</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
 my $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect('dbi:DBM:');
 $dbh-&gt;do(&quot;CREATE TABLE baz (foo CHAR(10), bar INTEGER)&quot;);
 $dbh-&gt;do(&quot;INSERT INTO baz (foo,bar) VALUES ('zippy',1)&quot;);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Will create a file that has a structure something like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  _metadata \0 | &lt;dbd_metadata&gt;&lt;schema&gt;&lt;/schema&gt;&lt;col_names&gt;foo,bar&lt;/col_names&gt;&lt;/dbd_metadata&gt;
  zippy        | 1
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The next time you access this table with DBD::DBM, it will treat
    the <i>_metadata \0</i> row as a header rather than as data and will pull
    the column names from there. However, if you access the file with something
    other than DBD::DBM, the row will be treated as a regular data row.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you do not want the column names stored as a data row in the
    table you can set the <i>dbm_store_metadata</i> attribute to 0.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
 my $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect('dbi:DBM:', undef, undef, { dbm_store_metadata =&gt; 0 });

 # or
 $dbh-&gt;{dbm_store_metadata} = 0;

 # or for per-table setting
 $dbh-&gt;{f_meta}-&gt;{qux}-&gt;{dbm_store_metadata} = 0;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">By default, DBD::DBM assumes that you have two columns named
    &quot;k&quot; and &quot;v&quot; (short for &quot;key&quot; and
    &quot;value&quot;). So if you have <i>dbm_store_metadata</i> set to 1 and
    you want to use alternate column names, you need to specify the column names
    like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
 my $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect('dbi:DBM:', undef, undef, {
     dbm_store_metadata =&gt; 0,
     dbm_cols =&gt; [ qw(foo bar) ],
 });

 # or
 $dbh-&gt;{dbm_store_metadata} = 0;
 $dbh-&gt;{dbm_cols}           = 'foo,bar';

 # or to set the column names on per-table basis, do this:
 # sets the column names only for table &quot;qux&quot;
 $dbh-&gt;{f_meta}-&gt;{qux}-&gt;{dbm_store_metadata} = 0;
 $dbh-&gt;{f_meta}-&gt;{qux}-&gt;{col_names}          = [qw(foo bar)];
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If you have a file that was created by another DBM program or
    created with <i>dbm_store_metadata</i> set to zero and you want to convert
    it to using DBD::DBM's column name storage, just use one of the methods
    above to name the columns but *without* specifying <i>dbm_store_metadata</i>
    as zero. You only have to do that once - thereafter you can get by without
    setting either <i>dbm_store_metadata</i> or setting <i>dbm_cols</i> because
    the names will be stored in the file.</p>

The private method <b>dbm_versions()</b> returns a summary of what other modules
  are being used at any given time. DBD::DBM can work with or without many other
  modules - it can use either SQL::Statement or DBI::SQL::Nano as its SQL

  modules, and many kinds of serializers when run with MLDBM. The

If you are using MLDBM, you can use DBD::DBM to take advantage of its

  store objects in columns, you should (but don't absolutely need to) declare it
  as a column of type BLOB (the type is *currently* ignored by the SQL engine,
  but it's good form).

Using the SQL DROP command will remove any file that has the name specified in
  the command with either '.pag' and '.dir', '.db' or your {f_ext} appended to
  it. So this be dangerous if you aren't sure what file it refers to:
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
 $dbh-&gt;do(qq{DROP TABLE &quot;/path/to/any/file&quot;});
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Each DBM type has limitations. SDBM_File, for example, can only
    store values of less than 1,000 characters. *You* as the script author must
    ensure that you don't exceed those bounds. If you try to insert a value that
    is larger than DBM can store, the results will be unpredictable. See the
    documentation for whatever DBM you are using for details.</p>
<p class="Pp">Different DBM implementations return records in different orders.
    That means that you <i>should not</i> rely on the order of records unless
    you use an ORDER BY statement.</p>
<p class="Pp">DBM data files are platform-specific. To move them from one
    platform to another, you'll need to do something along the lines of dumping
    your data to CSV on platform #1 and then dumping from CSV to DBM on platform
    #2. DBD::AnyData and DBD::CSV can help with that. There may also be DBM
    conversion tools for your platforms which would probably be quicker.</p>
<p class="Pp">When using MLDBM, there is a very powerful serializer - it will
    allow you to store Perl code or objects in database columns. When these get
    de-serialized, they may be eval'ed - in other words MLDBM (or actually
    Data::Dumper when used by MLDBM) may take the values and try to execute them
    in Perl. Obviously, this can present dangers, so if you do not know what is
    in a file, be careful before you access it with MLDBM turned on!</p>
