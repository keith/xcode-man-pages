The <b>refresh</b> and <b>wrefresh</b> routines (or <b>wnoutrefresh</b> and
  <b>doupdate</b>) must be called to get actual output to the terminal, as other
  routines merely manipulate data structures. The routine <b>wrefresh</b> copies
  the named window to the physical terminal screen, taking into account what is
  already there to do optimizations. The <b>refresh</b> routine is the same,
  using <b>stdscr</b> as the default window. Unless <b>leaveok</b> has been
  enabled, the physical cursor of the terminal is left at the location of the
  cursor for that window.
<p class="Pp">The <b>wnoutrefresh</b> and <b>doupdate</b> routines allow
    multiple updates with more efficiency than <b>wrefresh</b> alone. In
    addition to all the window structures, <b>curses</b> keeps two data
    structures representing the terminal screen: a physical screen, describing
    what is actually on the screen, and a virtual screen, describing what the
    programmer wants to have on the screen.</p>
<p class="Pp">The routine <b>wrefresh</b> works by first calling
    <b>wnoutrefresh</b>, which copies the named window to the virtual screen,
    and then calling <b>doupdate</b>, which compares the virtual screen to the
    physical screen and does the actual update. If the programmer wishes to
    output several windows at once, a series of calls to <b>wrefresh</b> results
    in alternating calls to <b>wnoutrefresh</b> and <b>doupdate</b>, causing
    several bursts of output to the screen. By first calling <b>wnoutrefresh</b>
    for each window, it is then possible to call <b>doupdate</b> once, resulting
    in only one burst of output, with fewer total characters transmitted and
    less CPU time used. If the <i>win</i> argument to <b>wrefresh</b> is the
    global variable <b>curscr</b>, the screen is immediately cleared and
    repainted from scratch.</p>
<p class="Pp">The phrase &quot;copies the named window to the virtual
    screen&quot; above is ambiguous. What actually happens is that all
    <i>touched</i> (changed) lines in the window are copied to the virtual
    screen. This affects programs that use overlapping windows; it means that if
    two windows overlap, you can refresh them in either order and the overlap
    region will be modified only when it is explicitly changed. (But see the
    section on <b>PORTABILITY</b> below for a warning about exploiting this
    behavior.)</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>wredrawln</b> routine indicates to <b>curses</b> that some
    screen lines are corrupted and should be thrown away before anything is
    written over them. It touches the indicated lines (marking them changed).
    The routine <b>redrawwin</b>() touches the entire window.</p>

Routines that return an integer return <b>ERR</b> upon failure, and <b>OK</b>
  (SVr4 only specifies &quot;an integer value other than <b>ERR</b>&quot;) upon
  successful completion.

      error.</dd>

The XSI Curses standard, Issue 4 describes these functions.
<p class="Pp">Whether <b>wnoutrefresh()</b> copies to the virtual screen the
    entire contents of a window or just its changed portions has never been
    well-documented in historic curses versions (including SVr4). It might be
    unwise to rely on either behavior in programs that might have to be linked
    with other curses implementations. Instead, you can do an explicit
    <b>touchwin()</b> before the <b>wnoutrefresh()</b> call to guarantee an
    entire-contents copy anywhere.</p>
