The <b>dds</b> overlay to <b>slapd</b>(8) implements dynamic objects as per RFC
  2589. The name <b>dds</b> stands for Dynamic Directory Services. It allows to
  define dynamic objects, characterized by the <b>dynamicObject</b> objectClass.
<p class="Pp">Dynamic objects have a limited lifetime, determined by a
    time-to-live (TTL) that can be refreshed by means of a specific
    <b>refresh</b> extended operation. This operation allows to set the Client
    Refresh Period (CRP), namely the period between refreshes that is required
    to preserve the dynamic object from expiration. The expiration time is
    computed by adding the requested TTL to the current time. When dynamic
    objects reach the end of their lifetime without being further refreshed,
    they are automatically deleted. There is no guarantee of immediate deletion,
    so clients should not count on it.</p>
<p class="Pp">Dynamic objects can have subordinates, provided these also are
    dynamic objects. RFC 2589 does not specify what the behavior of a dynamic
    directory service should be when a dynamic object with (dynamic)
    subordinates expires. In this implementation, the lifetime of dynamic
    objects with subordinates is prolonged until all the dynamic subordinates
    expire.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">This <b>slapd.conf</b>(5) directive adds the <b>dds</b> overlay to
    the current database:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>overlay dds</b></dt>
  <dd>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The database must have a <b>rootdn</b> specified, otherwise, the
    <b>dds</b> overlay will not be able to delete expired objects. The
    <b>dds</b> overlay may be used with any backend that implements the
    <b>add</b>, <b>modify</b>, <b>search</b>, and <b>delete</b> operations.
    Since its use may result in many internal entry lookups, adds and deletes,
    it should be best used in conjunction with backends that have reasonably
    good write performances.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">The config directives that are specific to the <b>dds</b> overlay
    are prefixed by <b>dds-</b>, to avoid potential conflicts with directives
    specific to the underlying database or to other stacked overlays.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>dds-max-ttl &lt;ttl&gt;</b></dt>
  <dd>Specifies the max TTL value. This is also the default TTL newly created
      dynamic objects receive, unless <b>dds-default-ttl</b> is set. When the
      client with a refresh extended operation requests a TTL higher than it,
      sizeLimitExceeded is returned. This value must be between 86400 (1 day,
      the default) and 31557600 (1 year plus 6 hours, as per RFC 2589).
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>dds-min-ttl &lt;ttl&gt;</b></dt>
  <dd>Specifies the min TTL value; clients requesting a lower TTL by means of
      the refresh extended operation actually obtain this value as CRP. If set
      to 0 (the default), no lower limit is set.
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>dds-default-ttl &lt;ttl&gt;</b></dt>
  <dd>Specifies the default TTL value that newly created dynamic objects get. If
      set to 0 (the default), the <b>dds-max-ttl</b> is used.
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>dds-interval &lt;ttl&gt;</b></dt>
  <dd>Specifies the interval between expiration checks; defaults to 1 hour.
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>dds-tolerance &lt;ttl&gt;</b></dt>
  <dd>Specifies an extra time that is added to the timer that actually wakes up
      the thread that will delete an expired dynamic object. So the nominal
      lifetime of the entry is that specified in the <b>entryTtl</b> attribute,
      but its lifetime will actually be <b>entryTtl + tolerance</b>. Note that
      there is no guarantee that the lifetime of a dynamic object will be
      <i>exactly</i> the requested TTL; due to implementation details, it may be
      longer, which is allowed by RFC 2589. By default, tolerance is 0.
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>dds-max-dynamicObjects &lt;num&gt;</b></dt>
  <dd>Specifies the maximum number of dynamic objects that can simultaneously
      exist within a naming context. This allows to limit the amount of
      resources (mostly in terms of run-queue size) that are used by dynamic
      objects. By default, no limit is set.
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>dds-state {TRUE|false}</b></dt>
  <dd>Specifies if the Dynamic Directory Services feature is enabled or not. By
      default it is; however, a proxy does not need to keep track of dynamic
      objects itself, it only needs to inform the frontend that support for
      dynamic objects is available.

<h1 class="Sh" id="ACCESS_CONTROL"><a class="permalink" href="#ACCESS_CONTROL">ACCESS
  CONTROL</a></h1>
The <b>dds</b> overlay restricts the refresh operation by requiring
  <b>manage</b> access to the <b>entryTtl</b> attribute (see
  <b>slapd.access</b>(5) for details about the <b>manage</b> access privilege).
  Since the <b>entryTtl</b> is an operational, NO-USER-MODIFICATION attribute,
  no direct write access to it is possible. So the <b>dds</b> overlay turns
  refresh extended operation into an internal modification to the value of the
  <b>entryTtl</b> attribute with the <b>relax</b> control set.
<p class="Pp">RFC 2589 recommends that anonymous clients should not be allowed
    to refresh a dynamic object. This can be implemented by appropriately
    crafting access control to obtain the desired effect.</p>
<p class="Pp">Example: restrict refresh to authenticated clients</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
access to attrs=entryTtl
	by users manage
	by * read
</pre>
</div>
Example: restrict refresh to the creator of the dynamic object
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
access to attrs=entryTtl
	by dnattr=creatorsName manage
	by * read
</pre>
</div>
Another suggested usage of dynamic objects is to implement dynamic meetings; in
  this case, all the participants to the meeting are allowed to refresh the
  meeting object, but only the creator can delete it (otherwise it will be
  deleted when the TTL expires)
<p class="Pp">Example: assuming <i>participant</i> is a valid DN-valued
    attribute, allow users to start a meeting and to join it; restrict refresh
    to the participants; restrict delete to the creator</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
access to dn.base=&quot;cn=Meetings&quot;
		attrs=children
	by users write
access to dn.onelevel=&quot;cn=Meetings&quot;
		attrs=entry
	by dnattr=creatorsName write
	by * read
access to dn.onelevel=&quot;cn=Meetings&quot;
		attrs=participant
	by dnattr=creatorsName write
	by users selfwrite
	by * read
access to dn.onelevel=&quot;cn=Meetings&quot;
		attrs=entryTtl
	by dnattr=participant manage
	by * read
</pre>

<h1 class="Sh" id="REPLICATION"><a class="permalink" href="#REPLICATION">REPLICATION</a></h1>
This implementation of RFC 2589 provides a restricted interpretation of how
  dynamic objects replicate. Only the master takes care of handling dynamic
  object expiration, while replicas simply see the dynamic object as a plain
  object.
<p class="Pp">When replicating these objects, one needs to explicitly exclude
    the <b>dynamicObject</b> class and the <b>entryTtl</b> attribute. This
    implementation of RFC 2589 introduces a new operational attribute,
    <b>entryExpireTimestamp</b>, that contains the expiration timestamp. This
    must be excluded from replication as well.</p>
<p class="Pp">The quick and dirty solution is to set <b>schemacheck=off</b> in
    the syncrepl configuration and, optionally, exclude the operational
    attributes from replication, using</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
syncrepl ...
	exattrs=entryTtl,entryExpireTimestamp
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">In any case the overlay must be either statically built in or
    run-time loaded by the consumer, so that it is aware of the
    <b>entryExpireTimestamp</b> operational attribute; however, it must not be
    configured in the shadow database. Currently, there is no means to remove
    the <b>dynamicObject</b> class from the entry; this may be seen as a
    feature, since it allows to see the dynamic properties of the object.</p>
