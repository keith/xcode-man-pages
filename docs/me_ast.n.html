   The definitions below are for supplemental macros used in Tcl/Tk
   manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget.  The
  	options follow on successive lines, in four columns separated
  	by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   RCS: @(#) $Id: man.macros,v 1.1 2009/01/30 04:56:47 andreas_kupries Exp $
  
  	# Set up traps and other miscellaneous stuff for Tcl/Tk man pages.
  	# Start an argument description
  .b
  	# define tabbing values for .AP
  
  	# BS - start boxed text
  	# ^y = starting y location
  	# ^b = 1
  	# BE - end boxed text (draw box now)
  	Draw four-sided box normally, but don't draw top of
  	box if the box started on an earlier page.
  	# VS - start vertical sidebar
  	# ^Y = starting y location
  	# ^v = 1 (for troff;  for nroff this doesn't matter)
  	# VE - end of vertical sidebar
  	# Special macro to handle page bottom:  finish off current
  	# box/sidebar if in box/sidebar mode, then invoked standard
  	# page bottom macro.
  	Draw three-sided box if this is the box's first page,
  	draw two sides but no top otherwise.
  	# DS - begin display
  	# DE - end display
  	# SO - start of list of standard options
  	# SE - end of list of standard options
  	# OP - start of full description for a single option
  	# CS - begin code excerpt
  	# CE - end code excerpt

grammar::me_ast - Various representations of ASTs
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
This document specifies various representations for the <i>abstract syntax
  tree</i>s (short <i>AST</i>) generated by instances of ME virtual machines,
  independent of variant. Please go and read the document
  <b>grammar::me_intro</b> first if you do not know what a ME virtual machine
  is.
<p class="Pp">ASTs and all the representations we specify distinguish between
    two types of nodes, namely:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>Terminal</dt>
  <dd>Terminal nodes refer to the terminal symbols found in the token stream.
      They are always leaf nodes. I.e. terminal nodes never have children.</dd>
  <dt>Nonterminal</dt>
  <dd>Nonterminal nodes represent a nonterminal symbol of the grammar used
      during parsing. They can occur as leaf and inner nodes of the tree.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Both types of nodes carry basic range information telling a user
    which parts of the input are covered by the node by providing the location
    of the first and last tokens found within the range. Locations are provided
    as non-negative integer offsets from the beginning of the token stream, with
    the first token found in the stream located at offset 0 (zero).</p>
<p class="Pp">The root of an AS tree can be either a terminal or nonterminal
    node.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="AST_VALUES"><a class="permalink" href="#AST_VALUES">AST
  VALUES</a></h1>
This representation of ASTs is a Tcl list. The main list represents the root
  node of the tree, with the representations of the children nested within.
<p class="Pp">Each node is represented by a single Tcl list containing three or
    more elements. The first element is either the empty string or the name of a
    nonterminal symbol (which is never the empty string). The second and third
    elements are then the locations of the first and last tokens. Any additional
    elements after the third are then the representations of the children, with
    the leftmost child first, i.e. as the fourth element of the list
    representing the node.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="AST_OBJECTS"><a class="permalink" href="#AST_OBJECTS">AST
  OBJECTS</a></h1>
In this representation an AST is represented by a Tcl object command whose API
  is compatible to the tree objects provided by the package <b>struct::tree</b>.
  I.e it has to support at least all of the methods described by that package,
  and may support more.
<p class="Pp">Because of this the remainder of the specifications is written
    using the terms of <b>struct::tree</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Each node of the AST directly maps to a node in the tree object.
    All data beyond the child nodes, i.e. node type and input locations, are
    stored in attributes of the node in the tree object. They are:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>type</dt>
  <dd>The type of the AST node. The recognized values are <b>terminal</b> and
      <b>nonterminal</b>.</dd>
  <dt>range</dt>
  <dd>The locations of the first and last token of the terminal data in the
      input covered by the node. This is a list containing two locations.</dd>
  <dt>detail</dt>
  <dd>This attribute is present only for nonterminal nodes. It contains the name
      of the nonterminal symbol stored in the node.</dd>
</dl>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="EXTENDED_AST_OBJECTS"><a class="permalink" href="#EXTENDED_AST_OBJECTS">EXTENDED
  AST OBJECTS</a></h1>
Extended AST objects are like AST objects, with additional information.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>detail</dt>
  <dd>This attribute is now present at all nodes. Its contents are unchanged for
      nonterminal nodes. For terminal nodes it contains a list describing all
      tokens from the input which are covered by the node.
    <p class="Pp">Each element of the list contains the token name, the
        associated lexeme attribute, line number, and column index, in this
        order.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>range_lc</dt>
  <dd>This new attribute is defined for all nodes, and contains the locations
      from attribute <i>range</i> translated into line number and column index.
      Lines are counted from 1, columns are counted from 0.</dd>
</dl>

  IDEAS, FEEDBACK</a></h1>
This document, and the package it describes, will undoubtedly contain bugs and
  other problems. Please report such in the category <i>grammar_me</i> of the
  <i>Tcllib SF Trackers</i> [http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=12883].
  Please also report any ideas for enhancements you may have for either package
  and/or documentation.
