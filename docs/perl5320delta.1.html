    <span class="Li">&quot;mbtowc&quot;</span>, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;wctomb&quot;</span> functions now work on shift state
    locales and are thread-safe on C99 and above compilers when executed on a
    platform that has locale thread-safety; the length parameters are now
    optional.</p>
<p class="Pp">These functions are always executed under the current C language
    locale. (See perllocale.) Most locales are stateless, but a few, notably the
    very rarely encountered ISO 2022, maintain a state between calls to these
    functions. Previously the state was cleared on every call, but now the state
    is not reset unless the appropriate parameter is
    <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">On threaded perls, the C99 functions <b>mbrlen</b>(3),
    <b>mbrtowc</b>(3), and <b>wcrtomb</b>(3), when available, are substituted
    for the plain functions. This makes these functions thread-safe when
    executing on a locale thread-safe platform.</p>
<p class="Pp">The string length parameters in
    <span class="Li">&quot;mblen&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;mbtowc&quot;</span> are now optional; useful only if
    you wish to restrict the length parsed in the source string to less than the

<p class="Pp">A signed <span class="Li">&quot;size_t&quot;</span> integer

  <li>When using locales, z/OS does not handle the

  <li>Some CPAN modules that are shipped with perl fail at least one of their

  <li><span class="Li">&quot;savepvn&quot;</span>'s len parameter is now a
      <span class="Li">&quot;Size_t&quot;</span> instead of an
      <span class="Li">&quot;I32&quot;</span> since we can handle longer strings
      than 31 bits.</li>
  <li>The lexer (<span class="Li">&quot;Perl_yylex()&quot;</span> in
      <i>toke.c</i>) was previously a single 4100-line function, relying heavily
      on <span class="Li">&quot;goto&quot;</span> and a lot of widely-scoped
      local variables to do its work. It has now been pulled apart into a few
      dozen smaller static functions; the largest remaining chunk
      (<span class="Li">&quot;yyl_word_or_keyword()&quot;</span>) is a little
      over 900 lines, and consists of a single
      <span class="Li">&quot;switch&quot;</span> statement, all of whose
      <span class="Li">&quot;case&quot;</span> groups are independent. This
      should be much easier to understand and maintain.</li>
  <li>The OS-level signal handlers and type (Sighandler_t) used by the perl core
      were declared as having three parameters, but the OS was always told to
      call them with one argument. This has been fixed by declaring them to have
      one parameter. See the merge commit
      <span class="Li">&quot;v5.31.5-346-g116e19abbf&quot;</span> for full
      details.</li>
  <li>The code that handles <span class="Li">&quot;tr///&quot;</span> has been
      extensively revised, fixing various bugs, especially when the source
      and/or replacement strings contain characters whose code points are above
      255. Some of the bugs were undocumented, one being that under some
      circumstances (but not all) with <span class="Li">&quot;/s&quot;</span>,
      the squeezing was done based on the source, rather than the replacement. A
      documented bug that got fixed was [GH #14777]
      &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14777&gt;.</li>
  <li>A new macro for XS writers dealing with UTF-8-encoded Unicode strings has
      been created &quot;<span class="Li">&quot;UTF8_CHK_SKIP&quot;</span>&quot;
      in perlapi that is safer in the face of malformed UTF-8 input than
      &quot;<span class="Li">&quot;UTF8_SKIP&quot;</span>&quot; in perlapi (but
      not as safe as
      &quot;<span class="Li">&quot;UTF8_SAFE_SKIP&quot;</span>&quot; in
      perlapi). It won't read past a NUL character. It has been backported in
      Devel::PPPort 3.55 and later.</li>
  <li>Added the
      <span class="Li">&quot;PL_curstackinfo-&gt;si_cxsubix&quot;</span> field.
      This records the stack index of the most recently pushed sub/format/eval
      context. It is set and restored automatically by
      <span class="Li">&quot;cx_pushsub()&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;cx_popsub()&quot;</span> etc., but would need to be
      manually managed if you do any unusual manipulation of the context
    stack.</li>
  <li>Various macros dealing with character type classification and changing
      case where the input is encoded in UTF-8 now require an extra parameter to
      prevent potential reads beyond the end of the buffer. Use of these has
      generated a deprecation warning since Perl 5.26. Details are in &quot;In
      XS code, use of various macros dealing with UTF-8.&quot; in
      perldeprecation</li>
  <li>A new parser function <b>parse_subsignature()</b> allows a keyword plugin
      to parse a subroutine signature while <span class="Li">&quot;use
      feature</span> <span class="Li">'signatures'&quot;</span> is in effect.
      This allows custom keywords to implement semantics similar to regular
      <span class="Li">&quot;sub&quot;</span> declarations that include
      signatures. [GH #16261]
    &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16261&gt;</li>
  <li>Since on some platforms we need to hold a mutex when temporarily switching
      locales, new macros
      (<span class="Li">&quot;STORE_LC_NUMERIC_SET_TO_NEEDED_IN&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;WITH_LC_NUMERIC_SET_TO_NEEDED&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;WITH_LC_NUMERIC_SET_TO_NEEDED_IN&quot;</span>) have
      been added to make it easier to do this safely and efficiently as part of
      [GH #17034] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/17034&gt;.</li>
  <li>The memory bookkeeping overhead for allocating an OP structure has been
      reduced by 8 bytes per OP on 64-bit systems.</li>
  <li><b>eval_pv()</b> no longer stringifies the exception when
      <span class="Li">&quot;[GH
      #17035]|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/17035&quot;</span>]</li>
  <li>The PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL environment variable was formerly only honoured on
      perl binaries built with DEBUGGING support. It is now checked on all perl
      builds. Its normal use is to force perl to individually free every block
      of memory which it has allocated before exiting, which is useful when
      using automated leak detection tools such as valgrind.</li>
  <li>The API <b>eval_sv()</b> now accepts a
      <span class="Li">&quot;G_RETHROW&quot;</span> flag. If this flag is set
      and an exception is thrown while compiling or executing the supplied code,
      it will be rethrown, and <b>eval_sv()</b> will not return. [GH #17036]
      &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/17036&gt;</li>
  <li>As part of the fix for [GH #1537]
      &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/1537&gt; <b>perl_parse()</b> now
      returns non-zero if <b>exit</b>(0) is called in a
      <span class="Li">&quot;BEGIN&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;UNITCHECK&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;CHECK&quot;</span> block.</li>
  <li>Most functions which recursively walked an op tree during compilation have
      been made non-recursive. This avoids SEGVs from stack overflow when the op
      tree is deeply nested, such as <span class="Li">&quot;$n == 1 ?
      &quot;one&quot; : $n == 2 ? &quot;two&quot; : ....&quot;</span>
      (especially in code which is auto-generated).
    <p class="Pp">This is particularly noticeable where the code is compiled
        within a separate thread, as threads tend to have small stacks by
        default.</p>

  <li><span class="Li">&quot;[GH
      #17108]|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/17108&quot;</span>]</li>
  <li>Exceptions thrown while <span class="Li">$@</span> is read-only could
      result in infinite recursion as perl tried to update
      <span class="Li">$@</span>, which throws another exception, resulting in a
      stack overflow. Perl now replaces <span class="Li">$@</span> with a copy
      if it's not a simple writable SV. [GH #17083]
      &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/17083&gt;</li>
  <li>Setting <span class="Li">$)</span> now properly sets supplementary group
      ids if you have the necessary privileges. [GH #17031]
      &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/17031&gt;</li>
  <li><b>close()</b> on a pipe now preemptively clears the PerlIO object from
      the IO SV. This prevents a second attempt to close the already closed
      PerlIO object if a signal handler calls <b>die()</b> or <b>exit()</b>
      while <b>close()</b> is waiting for the child process to complete. [GH
      #13929] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/13929&gt;</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;sprintf(&quot;%.*a&quot;, -10000, $x)&quot;</span>
      would cause a buffer overflow due to mishandling of the negative precision
      value. [GH #16942] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16942&gt;</li>
  <li><b>scalar()</b> on a reference could cause an erroneous assertion failure

  <li><span class="Li">&quot;%{^CAPTURE_ALL}&quot;</span> is now an alias to

  <li><span class="Li">&quot;%{^CAPTURE}&quot;</span> didn't work if

  <li>Extraordinarily large (over 2GB) floating point format widths could cause
      an integer overflow in the underlying call to <b>snprintf()</b>, resulting
      in an assertion. Formatted floating point widths are now limited to the
      range of int, the return value of <b>snprintf()</b>. [#16881

      enabled.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;@x {&quot;a&quot;}&quot;</span> (with the space) in

  <li><span class="Li">&quot;readline @foo&quot;</span> now evaluates
      <span class="Li">@foo</span> in scalar context. Previously it would be
      evaluated in list context, and since <b>readline()</b> pops only one
      argument from the stack, the stack could underflow, or be left with
      unexpected values on the stack. [GH #16929]
      &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16929&gt;</li>
  <li>Parsing incomplete hex or binary literals was changed in 5.31.1 to treat
      such a literal as just the 0, leaving the following
      <span class="Li">&quot;x&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;b&quot;</span> to be parsed as part of the next
      token. This could lead to some silent changes in behaviour, so now
      incomplete hex or binary literals produce a fatal error. [GH #17010]
      &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/17010&gt;</li>
  <li><b>eval_pv()</b>'s <i>croak_on_error</i> flag will now throw even if the
      exception is a false overloaded value. [GH #17036]
