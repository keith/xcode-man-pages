  OPTIONS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Options are primarily referred to by name. These names are case
    insensitive and underscores are ignored. For example, `<b>allexport</b>' is
    equivalent to `<b>A__lleXP_ort</b>'.</p>
<p class="Pp">The sense of an option name may be inverted by preceding it with
    `<b>no</b>', so `<b>setopt No_Beep</b>' is equivalent to `<b>unsetopt
    beep</b>'. This inversion can only be done once, so `<b>nonobeep</b>' is
    <i>not</i> a synonym for `<b>beep</b>'. Similarly, `<b>tify</b>' is not a
    synonym for `<b>nonotify</b>' (the inversion of `<b>notify</b>').</p>
<p class="Pp">Some options also have one or more single letter names. There are
    two sets of single letter options: one used by default, and another used to
    emulate <b>sh</b>/<b>ksh</b> (used when the <b>SH_OPTION_LETTERS</b> option
    is set). The single letter options can be used on the shell command line, or
    with the <b>set</b>, <b>setopt</b> and <b>unsetopt</b> builtins, as normal
    Unix options preceded by `<b>-</b>'.</p>
<p class="Pp">The sense of the single letter options may be inverted by using
    `<b>+</b>' instead of `<b>-</b>'. Some of the single letter option names
    refer to an option being off, in which case the inversion of that name
    refers to the option being on. For example, `<b>+n</b>' is the short name of
    `<b>exec</b>', and `<b>-n</b>' is the short name of its inversion,
    `<b>noexec</b>'.</p>
<p class="Pp">In strings of single letter options supplied to the shell at
    startup, trailing whitespace will be ignored; for example the string `<b>-f
    </b>' will be treated just as `<b>-f</b>', but the string `<b>-f i</b>' is
    an error. This is because many systems which implement the `<b>#!</b>'
    mechanism for calling scripts do not strip trailing whitespace.</p>
<p class="Pp">It is possible for options to be set within a function scope. See
    the description of the option <b>LOCAL_OPTIONS</b> below.</p>

    emulations are marked &lt;C&gt;, &lt;K&gt;, &lt;S&gt;, &lt;Z&gt; as

    `<b>set -o</b>' or `<b>set +o</b>'), those turned on by default appear in
    the list prefixed with `<b>no</b>'. Hence (unless <b>KSH_OPTION_PRINT</b> is

  <dd>If a command is issued that can't be executed as a normal command, and the
      command is the name of a directory, perform the <b>cd</b> command to that
      directory. This option is only applicable if the option <b>SHIN_STDIN</b>
      is set, i.e. if commands are being read from standard input. The option is
      designed for interactive use; it is recommended that <b>cd</b> be used

      (see the section `Filename Expansion').</dd>
  <dt id="CD_SILENT"><a class="permalink" href="#CD_SILENT"><b>CD_SILENT</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Never print the working directory after a <b>cd</b> (whether explicit or
      implied with the <b>AUTO_CD</b> option set). <b>cd</b> normally prints the
      working directory when the argument given to it was <b>-</b>, a stack
      entry, or the name of a directory found under <b>CDPATH</b>. Note that
      this is distinct from <b>pushd</b>'s stack-printing behaviour, which is
      controlled by <b>PUSHD_SILENT</b>. This option overrides the

      (in other words, `<b>foo/..</b>' would be removed from the path, or if
      `<b>..</b>' is the first part of the path, the last part of the current
      working directory would be removed), instead resolve the path to the
      physical directory. This option is overridden by <b>CHASE_LINKS</b>.</dd>

<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">For example, suppose <b>/foo/bar</b> is a link to the directory

  <dd>Resolve symbolic links to their true values when changing directory. This

  <dd>Modifies the behaviour of <b>cd</b>, <b>chdir</b> and <b>pushd</b>
      commands to make them more compatible with the POSIX standard. The
      behaviour with the option unset is described in the documentation for the
      <b>cd</b> builtin in <i>zshbuiltins</i>(1). If the option is set, the
      shell does not test for directories beneath the local directory
      (`<b>.</b>') until after all directories in <b>cdpath</b> have been
      tested, and the <b>cd</b> and <b>chdir</b> commands do not recognise

<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">Also, if the option is set, the conditions under which the shell
    prints the new directory after changing to it are modified. It is no longer
    restricted to interactive shells (although printing of the directory stack
    with <b>pushd</b> is still limited to interactive shells); and any use of a
    component of <b>CDPATH</b>, including a `<b>.</b>' but excluding an empty

      those that have to come directly after the name (like `<b>}</b>',
      `<b>:</b>', etc.), the automatically added character is deleted, so that

      if a `<b>*</b>' was added to the end of the word, or inserted at the

<p class="Pp">Another difference is that with the option set assignment to an

    sufficient as the syntax <i>variable</i><b>=</b><i>value</i> has already
