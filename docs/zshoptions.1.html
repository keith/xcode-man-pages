<h1 class="Sh" id="SPECIFYING_OPTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#SPECIFYING_OPTIONS">SPECIFYING
  OPTIONS</a></h1>
Options are primarily referred to by name. These names are case insensitive and
  underscores are ignored. For example, `<b>allexport</b>' is equivalent to
  `<b>A__lleXP_ort</b>'.
<p class="Pp">The sense of an option name may be inverted by preceding it with
    `<b>no</b>', so `<b>setopt No_Beep</b>' is equivalent to `<b>unsetopt
    beep</b>'. This inversion can only be done once, so `<b>nonobeep</b>' is
    <i>not</i> a synonym for `<b>beep</b>'. Similarly, `<b>tify</b>' is not a
    synonym for `<b>nonotify</b>' (the inversion of `<b>notify</b>').</p>
<p class="Pp">Some options also have one or more single letter names. There are
    two sets of single letter options: one used by default, and another used to
    emulate <b>sh</b>/<b>ksh</b> (used when the <b>SH_OPTION_LETTERS</b> option
    is set). The single letter options can be used on the shell command line, or
    with the <b>set</b>, <b>setopt</b> and <b>unsetopt</b> builtins, as normal
    Unix options preceded by `<b>-</b>'.</p>
<p class="Pp">The sense of the single letter options may be inverted by using
    `<b>+</b>' instead of `<b>-</b>'. Some of the single letter option names
    refer to an option being off, in which case the inversion of that name
    refers to the option being on. For example, `<b>+n</b>' is the short name of
    `<b>exec</b>', and `<b>-n</b>' is the short name of its inversion,
    `<b>noexec</b>'.</p>
<p class="Pp">In strings of single letter options supplied to the shell at
    startup, trailing whitespace will be ignored; for example the string `<b>-f
    </b>' will be treated just as `<b>-f</b>', but the string `<b>-f i</b>' is
    an error. This is because many systems which implement the `<b>#!</b>'
    mechanism for calling scripts do not strip trailing whitespace.</p>

In the following list, options set by default in all emulations are marked
  &lt;D&gt;; those set by default only in csh, ksh, sh, or zsh emulations are
  marked &lt;C&gt;, &lt;K&gt;, &lt;S&gt;, &lt;Z&gt; as appropriate. When listing
  options (by `<b>setopt</b>', `<b>unsetopt</b>', `<b>set -o</b>' or `<b>set
  +o</b>'), those turned on by default appear in the list prefixed with
  `<b>no</b>'. Hence (unless <b>KSH_OPTION_PRINT</b> is set), `<b>setopt</b>'
  shows all options whose settings are changed from the default.

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>AUTO_CD</b> (<b>-J</b>)</dt>
  <dd>If a command is issued that can't be executed as a normal command, and the
      command is the name of a directory, perform the <b>cd</b> command to that
      directory. This option is only applicable if the option <b>SHIN_STDIN</b>
      is set, i.e. if commands are being read from standard input. The option is
      designed for interactive use; it is recommended that <b>cd</b> be used
      explicitly in scripts to avoid ambiguity.</dd>
  <dt><b>AUTO_PUSHD</b> (<b>-N</b>)</dt>
  <dd>Make <b>cd</b> push the old directory onto the directory stack.</dd>
  <dt><b>CDABLE_VARS</b> (<b>-T</b>)</dt>
  <dd>If the argument to a <b>cd</b> command (or an implied <b>cd</b> with the
      <b>AUTO_CD</b> option set) is not a directory, and does not begin with a
      slash, try to expand the expression as if it were preceded by a `<b>~</b>'
      (see the section `Filename Expansion').</dd>
  <dt><b>CD_SILENT</b></dt>
  <dd>Never print the working directory after a <b>cd</b> (whether explicit or
      implied with the <b>AUTO_CD</b> option set). <b>cd</b> normally prints the
      working directory when the argument given to it was <b>-</b>, a stack
      entry, or the name of a directory found under <b>CDPATH</b>. Note that
      this is distinct from <b>pushd</b>'s stack-printing behaviour, which is
      controlled by <b>PUSHD_SILENT</b>. This option overrides the
      printing-related effects of <b>POSIX_CD</b>.</dd>
  <dt><b>CHASE_DOTS</b></dt>
  <dd>When changing to a directory containing a path segment `<b>..</b>' which
      would otherwise be treated as canceling the previous segment in the path
      (in other words, `<b>foo/..</b>' would be removed from the path, or if
      `<b>..</b>' is the first part of the path, the last part of the current
      working directory would be removed), instead resolve the path to the
      physical directory. This option is overridden by <b>CHASE_LINKS</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">For example, suppose <b>/foo/bar</b> is a link to the directory
    <b>/alt/rod</b>. Without this option set, `<b>cd /foo/bar/..</b>' changes to
    <b>/foo</b>; with it set, it changes to <b>/alt</b>. The same applies if the
    current directory is <b>/foo/bar</b> and `<b>cd ..</b>' is used. Note that
    all other symbolic links in the path will also be resolved.</p>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>CHASE_LINKS</b> (<b>-w</b>)</dt>
  <dd>Resolve symbolic links to their true values when changing directory. This
      also has the effect of <b>CHASE_DOTS</b>, i.e. a `<b>..</b>' path segment
      will be treated as referring to the physical parent, even if the preceding
      path segment is a symbolic link.</dd>
  <dt><b>POSIX_CD</b> &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt;</dt>
  <dd>Modifies the behaviour of <b>cd</b>, <b>chdir</b> and <b>pushd</b>
      commands to make them more compatible with the POSIX standard. The
      behaviour with the option unset is described in the documentation for the
      <b>cd</b> builtin in <i>zshbuiltins</i>(1). If the option is set, the
      shell does not test for directories beneath the local directory
      (`<b>.</b>') until after all directories in <b>cdpath</b> have been
      tested, and the <b>cd</b> and <b>chdir</b> commands do not recognise
      arguments of the form `{<b>+</b>|<b>-</b>}<i>n</i>' as directory stack
      entries.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">Also, if the option is set, the conditions under which the shell
    prints the new directory after changing to it are modified. It is no longer
    restricted to interactive shells (although printing of the directory stack
    with <b>pushd</b> is still limited to interactive shells); and any use of a
    component of <b>CDPATH</b>, including a `<b>.</b>' but excluding an empty
    component that is otherwise treated as `<b>.</b>', causes the directory to
    be printed.</p>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>PUSHD_IGNORE_DUPS</b></dt>
  <dd>Don't push multiple copies of the same directory onto the directory
    stack.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>ALWAYS_LAST_PROMPT</b> &lt;D&gt;</dt>
  <dd>If unset, key functions that list completions try to return to the last
      prompt if given a numeric argument. If set these functions try to return
      to the last prompt if given <i>no</i> numeric argument.</dd>
  <dt><b>ALWAYS_TO_END</b></dt>
  <dd>If a completion is performed with the cursor within a word, and a full
      completion is inserted, the cursor is moved to the end of the word. That
      is, the cursor is moved to the end of the word if either a single match is
      inserted or menu completion is performed.</dd>
  <dt><b>AUTO_LIST</b> (<b>-9</b>) &lt;D&gt;</dt>
  <dd>Automatically list choices on an ambiguous completion.</dd>
  <dt><b>AUTO_MENU</b> &lt;D&gt;</dt>
  <dd>Automatically use menu completion after the second consecutive request for
      completion, for example by pressing the tab key repeatedly. This option is
      overridden by <b>MENU_COMPLETE</b>.</dd>
  <dt><b>AUTO_NAME_DIRS</b></dt>
  <dd>Any parameter that is set to the absolute name of a directory immediately
      becomes a name for that directory, that will be used by the `<b>%~</b>'
      and related prompt sequences, and will be available when completion is
      performed on a word starting with `<b>~</b>'. (Otherwise, the parameter
      must be used in the form `<b>~</b><i>param</i>' first.)</dd>
  <dt><b>AUTO_PARAM_KEYS</b> &lt;D&gt;</dt>
  <dd>If a parameter name was completed and a following character (normally a
      space) automatically inserted, and the next character typed is one of
      those that have to come directly after the name (like `<b>}</b>',
      `<b>:</b>', etc.), the automatically added character is deleted, so that
      the character typed comes immediately after the parameter name. Completion
      in a brace expansion is affected similarly: the added character is a
      `<b>,</b>', which will be removed if `<b>}</b>' is typed next.</dd>
  <dt><b>AUTO_PARAM_SLASH</b> &lt;D&gt;</dt>
  <dd>If a parameter is completed whose content is the name of a directory, then
      add a trailing slash instead of a space.</dd>
  <dt><b>AUTO_REMOVE_SLASH</b> &lt;D&gt;</dt>
  <dd>When the last character resulting from a completion is a slash and the
      next character typed is a word delimiter, a slash, or a character that
      ends a command (such as a semicolon or an ampersand), remove the
    slash.</dd>
  <dt><b>BASH_AUTO_LIST</b></dt>
  <dd>On an ambiguous completion, automatically list choices when the completion
      function is called twice in succession. This takes precedence over
      <b>AUTO_LIST</b>. The setting of <b>LIST_AMBIGUOUS</b> is respected. If
      <b>AUTO_MENU</b> is set, the menu behaviour will then start with the third
      press. Note that this will not work with <b>MENU_COMPLETE</b>, since
      repeated completion calls immediately cycle through the list in that
    case.</dd>
  <dt><b>COMPLETE_ALIASES</b></dt>
  <dd>Prevents aliases on the command line from being internally substituted
      before completion is attempted. The effect is to make the alias a distinct
      command for completion purposes.</dd>
  <dt><b>COMPLETE_IN_WORD</b></dt>
  <dd>If unset, the cursor is set to the end of the word if completion is
      started. Otherwise it stays there and completion is done from both
    ends.</dd>
  <dt><b>GLOB_COMPLETE</b></dt>
  <dd>When the current word has a glob pattern, do not insert all the words
      resulting from the expansion but generate matches as for completion and
      cycle through them like <b>MENU_COMPLETE</b>. The matches are generated as
      if a `<b>*</b>' was added to the end of the word, or inserted at the
      cursor when <b>COMPLETE_IN_WORD</b> is set. This actually uses pattern
      matching, not globbing, so it works not only for files but for any
      completion, such as options, user names, etc.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">Note that when the pattern matcher is used, matching control (for
    example, case-insensitive or anchored matching) cannot be used. This
    limitation only applies when the current word contains a pattern; simply
    turning on the <b>GLOB_COMPLETE</b> option does not have this effect.</p>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>HASH_LIST_ALL</b> &lt;D&gt;</dt>
  <dd>Whenever a command completion or spelling correction is attempted, make
      sure the entire command path is hashed first. This makes the first
      completion slower but avoids false reports of spelling errors.</dd>
  <dt><b>LIST_AMBIGUOUS</b> &lt;D&gt;</dt>
  <dd>This option works when <b>AUTO_LIST</b> or <b>BASH_AUTO_LIST</b> is also
      set. If there is an unambiguous prefix to insert on the command line, that
      is done without a completion list being displayed; in other words,
      auto-listing behaviour only takes place when nothing would be inserted. In
      the case of <b>BASH_AUTO_LIST</b>, this means that the list will be
      delayed to the third call of the function.</dd>
  <dt><b>LIST_BEEP</b> &lt;D&gt;</dt>
  <dd>Beep on an ambiguous completion. More accurately, this forces the
      completion widgets to return status 1 on an ambiguous completion, which
      causes the shell to beep if the option <b>BEEP</b> is also set; this may
      be modified if completion is called from a user-defined widget.</dd>
  <dt><b>LIST_PACKED</b></dt>
  <dd>Try to make the completion list smaller (occupying less lines) by printing
      the matches in columns with different widths.</dd>
  <dt><b>LIST_ROWS_FIRST</b></dt>
  <dd>Lay out the matches in completion lists sorted horizontally, that is, the
      second match is to the right of the first one, not under it as usual.</dd>
  <dt><b>LIST_TYPES</b> (<b>-X</b>) &lt;D&gt;</dt>
  <dd>When listing files that are possible completions, show the type of each
      file with a trailing identifying mark.</dd>
  <dt><b>MENU_COMPLETE</b> (<b>-Y</b>)</dt>
  <dd>On an ambiguous completion, instead of listing possibilities or beeping,
      insert the first match immediately. Then when completion is requested
      again, remove the first match and insert the second match, etc. When there
      are no more matches, go back to the first one again.
      <b>reverse-menu-complete</b> may be used to loop through the list in the
      other direction. This option overrides <b>AUTO_MENU</b>.</dd>
  <dt><b>REC_EXACT</b> (<b>-S</b>)</dt>
  <dd>If the string on the command line exactly matches one of the possible
      completions, it is accepted, even if there is another completion (i.e.
      that string with something else added) that also matches.</dd>

  <dt><b>CASE_GLOB</b> &lt;D&gt;</dt>
  <dd>Make globbing (filename generation) sensitive to case. Note that other
      uses of patterns are always sensitive to case. If the option is unset, the
      presence of any character which is special to filename generation will
      cause case-insensitive matching. For example, <b>cvs(/)</b> can match the

      has more than one word the parameter will become an array with those words
      as arguments. This option is provided for backwards compatibility only:
      globbing is always performed on the right hand side of array assignments
      of the form `<i>name</i><b>=(</b><i>value</i><b>)</b>' (e.g.
      `<b>foo=(*)</b>') and this form is recommended for clarity; with this
      option set, it is not possible to predict whether the result will be an

      `<b>**.c</b>' finds a file ending in <b>.c</b> in any subdirectory, and
      `<b>***.c</b>' does the same while also following symbolic links. A
      <b>/</b> immediately after the `<b>**</b>' or `<b>***</b>' forces the

  <dt><b>GLOB_SUBST</b> &lt;C&gt; &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt;</dt>

      If <b>SH_GLOB</b> is set but <b>KSH_GLOB</b> is not, the shell allows the
      interpretation of subshell expressions enclosed in parentheses in some
      cases where there is no space before the opening parenthesis, e.g.
      <b>!(true)</b> is interpreted as if there were a space after the <b>!</b>.

  <dd>Print a warning message when a global parameter is created in a function

      has not been declared local when it should have been. Parameters
      explicitly declared global from within a function using <b>typeset -g</b>
      do not cause a warning. Note that there is no warning when a local

  <dt><b>WARN_NESTED_VAR</b></dt>
  <dd>Print a warning message when an existing parameter from an enclosing

      warning. This is the companion to <b>WARN_CREATE_GLOBAL</b> as in this
      case the warning is only printed when a parameter is <i>not</i> created.
      Where possible, use of <b>typeset -g</b> to set the parameter suppresses
      the error, but note that this needs to be used every time the parameter is

  <dd>Beep in ZLE when a widget attempts to access a history entry which isn't
      there.</dd>
  <dt><b>HIST_EXPIRE_DUPS_FIRST</b></dt>
  <dd>If the internal history needs to be trimmed to add the current command
      line, setting this option will cause the oldest history event that has a
      duplicate to be lost before losing a unique event from the list. You
      should be sure to set the value of <b>HISTSIZE</b> to a larger number than
      <b>SAVEHIST</b> in order to give you some room for the duplicated events,
      otherwise this option will behave just like <b>HIST_IGNORE_ALL_DUPS</b>
      once the history fills up with unique events.</dd>
  <dt><b>HIST_FCNTL_LOCK</b></dt>
  <dd>When writing out the history file, by default zsh uses ad-hoc file locking
      to avoid known problems with locking on some operating systems. With this
      option locking is done by means of the system's <b>fcntl</b> call, where
      this method is available. On recent operating systems this may provide
      better performance, in particular avoiding history corruption when files
      are stored on NFS.</dd>
  <dt><b>HIST_FIND_NO_DUPS</b></dt>
  <dd>When searching for history entries in the line editor, do not display
      duplicates of a line previously found, even if the duplicates are not
      contiguous.</dd>
  <dt><b>HIST_IGNORE_ALL_DUPS</b></dt>

  <dt><b>HIST_IGNORE_DUPS</b> (<b>-h</b>)</dt>
  <dd>Do not enter command lines into the history list if they are duplicates of
      the previous event.</dd>
  <dt><b>HIST_IGNORE_SPACE</b> (<b>-g</b>)</dt>
  <dd>Remove command lines from the history list when the first character on the
      line is a space, or when one of the expanded aliases contains a leading
      space. Only normal aliases (not global or suffix aliases) have this
      behaviour. Note that the command lingers in the internal history until the
      next command is entered before it vanishes, allowing you to briefly reuse
      or edit the line. If you want to make it vanish right away without
      entering another command, type a space and press return.</dd>
  <dt><b>HIST_LEX_WORDS</b></dt>
  <dd>By default, shell history that is read in from files is split into words
      on all white space. This means that arguments with quoted whitespace are
      not correctly handled, with the consequence that references to words in
      history lines that have been read from a file may be inaccurate. When this
      option is set, words read in from a history file are divided up in a
      similar fashion to normal shell command line handling. Although this
      produces more accurately delimited words, if the size of the history file
      is large this can be slow. Trial and error is necessary to decide.</dd>
  <dt><b>HIST_NO_FUNCTIONS</b></dt>
  <dd>Remove function definitions from the history list. Note that the function
      lingers in the internal history until the next command is entered before
      it vanishes, allowing you to briefly reuse or edit the definition.</dd>
  <dt><b>HIST_NO_STORE</b></dt>
  <dd>Remove the <b>history</b> (<b>fc -l</b>) command from the history list
      when invoked. Note that the command lingers in the internal history until
      the next command is entered before it vanishes, allowing you to briefly
      reuse or edit the line.</dd>

  <dd>Remove superfluous blanks from each command line being added to the
      history list.</dd>
  <dt><b>HIST_SAVE_BY_COPY</b> &lt;D&gt;</dt>
  <dd>When the history file is re-written, we normally write out a copy of the
      file named <b>$HISTFILE.new</b> and then rename it over the old one.
      However, if this option is unset, we instead truncate the old history file
      and write out the new version in-place. If one of the history-appending
      options is enabled, this option only has an effect when the enlarged
      history file needs to be re-written to trim it down to size. Disable this
      only if you have special needs, as doing so makes it possible to lose
      history entries if zsh gets interrupted during the save.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">When writing out a copy of the history file, zsh preserves the old
    file's permissions and group information, but will refuse to write out a new

  <dd>Whenever the user enters a line with history expansion, don't execute the
      line directly; instead, perform history expansion and reload the line into
      the editing buffer.</dd>
  <dt><b>INC_APPEND_HISTORY</b></dt>
  <dd>This option works like <b>APPEND_HISTORY</b> except that new history lines
      are added to the <b>$HISTFILE</b> incrementally (as soon as they are
      entered), rather than waiting until the shell exits. The file will still
      be periodically re-written to trim it when the number of lines grows 20%
      beyond the value specified by <b>$SAVEHIST</b> (see also the
      <b>HIST_SAVE_BY_COPY</b> option).</dd>
  <dt><b>INC_APPEND_HISTORY_TIME</b></dt>
  <dd>This option is a variant of <b>INC_APPEND_HISTORY</b> in which, where
      possible, the history entry is written out to the file after the command
      is finished, so that the time taken by the command is recorded correctly
      in the history file in <b>EXTENDED_HISTORY</b> format. This means that the
      history entry will not be available immediately from other instances of
      the shell that are using the same history file.</dd>

<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">This option is only useful if <b>INC_APPEND_HISTORY</b> and

  <dt><b>SHARE_HISTORY</b> &lt;K&gt;</dt>
  <dd></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">This option both imports new commands from the history file, and
    also causes your typed commands to be appended to the history file (the
    latter is like specifying <b>INC_APPEND_HISTORY</b>, which should be turned
    off if this option is in effect). The history lines are also output with
    timestamps ala <b>EXTENDED_HISTORY</b> (which makes it easier to find the
    spot where we left off reading the file after it gets re-written).</p>
<p class="Pp">By default, history movement commands visit the imported lines as
    well as the local lines, but you can toggle this on and off with the
    set-local-history zle binding. It is also possible to create a zle widget
    that will make some commands ignore imported commands, and some include
    them.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you find that you want more control over when commands get
    imported, you may wish to turn <b>SHARE_HISTORY</b> off,
    <b>INC_APPEND_HISTORY</b> or <b>INC_APPEND_HISTORY_TIME</b> (see above) on,
    and then manually import commands whenever you need them using `<b>fc</b>
    <b>-RI</b>'.</p>

  <dd>By default, zsh does not allow the definition of functions using the
      `<i>name</i> <b>()</b>' syntax if <i>name</i> was expanded as an alias:
      this causes an error. This is usually the desired behaviour, as otherwise
      the combination of an alias and a function based on the same definition
      can easily cause problems.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">

</div>
<p class="Pp">Here, <b>foo</b> is expanded as an alias to <b>bar</b> before the

    By default this is instead an error in native mode. Note that quoting any
    part of the function name, or using the keyword <b>function</b>, avoids the
    problem, so is recommended when the function name can also be an alias.</p>

      be treated similarly and hence appear as `<b>077</b>' instead of
      `<b>8#77</b>'. This option has no effect on the choice of the output base,
      nor on the output of bases other than hexadecimal and octal. Note that
      these formats will be understood on input irrespective of the setting of
      <b>C_BASES</b>.</dd>
  <dt><b>C_PRECEDENCES</b></dt>

  <dt><b>DEBUG_BEFORE_CMD</b> &lt;D&gt;</dt>
  <dd>Run the <b>DEBUG</b> trap before each command; otherwise it is run after

  <dt><b>ERR_EXIT</b> (<b>-e</b>, ksh: <b>-e</b>)</dt>
  <dd>If a command has a non-zero exit status, execute the <b>ZERR</b> trap, if

</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">The behaviour is also disabled inside <b>DEBUG</b> traps. In this

  <dd>If a command has a non-zero exit status, return immediately from the

</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">Normally this option inherits the behaviour of <b>ERR_EXIT</b>
    that code followed by `<b>&amp;&amp;</b>' `<b>||</b>' does not trigger a

<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b>summit || true</b>

<p class="Pp">no return is forced as the combined effect always has a zero

    itself a function, code inside it is considered separately: it may force a
    return from <b>summit</b> (assuming the option remains set within
    <b>summit</b>), but not from the enclosing context. This behaviour is
    different from <b>ERR_EXIT</b> which is unaffected by function scope.</p>

  <dt><b>EVAL_LINENO</b> &lt;Z&gt;</dt>
  <dd>If set, line numbers of expressions evaluated using the builtin
      <b>eval</b> are tracked separately of the enclosing environment. This

      the prompt escape <b>%i</b>. If the option is set, the prompt escape
      <b>%N</b> will output the string `<b>(eval)</b>' instead of the script or
      function name as an indication. (The two prompt escapes are typically used
      in the parameter <b>PS4</b> to be output when the option <b>XTRACE</b> is
      set.) If <b>EVAL_LINENO</b> is unset, the line number of the surrounding
      script or function is retained during the evaluation.</dd>
  <dt><b>EXEC</b> (<b>+n</b>, ksh: <b>+n</b>) &lt;D&gt;</dt>
  <dd>Do execute commands. Without this option, commands are read and checked
      for syntax errors, but not executed. This option cannot be turned off in
      an interactive shell, except when `<b>-n</b>' is supplied to the shell at
      startup.</dd>
  <dt><b>FUNCTION_ARGZERO</b> &lt;C&gt; &lt;Z&gt;</dt>
  <dd>When executing a shell function or sourcing a script, set <b>$0</b>
      temporarily to the name of the function/script. Note that toggling
      <b>FUNCTION_ARGZERO</b> from on to off (or off to on) does not change the
      current value of <b>$0</b>. Only the state upon entry to the function or
      script has an effect. Compare <b>POSIX_ARGZERO</b>.</dd>
  <dt><b>LOCAL_LOOPS</b></dt>
  <dd>When this option is not set, the effect of <b>break</b> and
      <b>continue</b> commands may propagate outside function scope, affecting
      loops in calling functions. When the option is set in a calling function,
      a <b>break</b> or a <b>continue</b> that is not caught within a called
      function (regardless of the setting of the option within that function)
      produces a warning and the effect is cancelled.</dd>
  <dt><b>LOCAL_OPTIONS</b> &lt;K&gt;</dt>
  <dd>If this option is set at the point of return from a shell function, most
      options (including this one) which were in force upon entry to the
      function are restored; options that are not restored are <b>PRIVILEGED</b>
      and <b>RESTRICTED</b>. Otherwise, only this option, and the
      <b>LOCAL_LOOPS</b>, <b>XTRACE</b> and <b>PRINT_EXIT_VALUE</b> options are
      restored. Hence if this is explicitly unset by a shell function the other
      options in force at the point of return will remain so. A shell function
      can also guarantee itself a known shell configuration with a formulation
      like `<b>emulate -L zsh</b>'; the <b>-L</b> activates
      <b>LOCAL_OPTIONS</b>.</dd>
  <dt><b>LOCAL_PATTERNS</b></dt>
  <dd>If this option is set at the point of return from a shell function, the
      state of pattern disables, as set with the builtin command `<b>disable
      -p</b>', is restored to what it was when the function was entered. The
      behaviour of this option is similar to the effect of <b>LOCAL_OPTIONS</b>
      on options; hence `<b>emulate -L sh</b>' (or indeed any other emulation
      with the <b>-L</b> option) activates <b>LOCAL_PATTERNS</b>.</dd>
  <dt><b>LOCAL_TRAPS</b> &lt;K&gt;</dt>
  <dd>If this option is set when a signal trap is set inside a function, then
      the previous status of the trap for that signal will be restored when the
      function exits. Note that this option must be set <i>prior</i> to altering
      the trap behaviour in a function; unlike <b>LOCAL_OPTIONS</b>, the value
      on exit from the function is irrelevant. However, it does not need to be
      set before any global trap for that to be correctly restored by a
      function. For example,</dd>

  <dt><b>CSH_JUNKIE_HISTORY</b> &lt;C&gt;</dt>

    </b><i>non_existent_option</i><b> ]]</b> are suppressed.</p>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>POSIX_IDENTIFIERS</b> &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt;</dt>
  <dd>When this option is set, only the ASCII characters <b>a</b> to <b>z</b>,
      <b>A</b> to <b>Z</b>, <b>0</b> to <b>9</b> and <b>_</b> may be used in
      identifiers (names of shell parameters and modules).</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">In addition, setting this option limits the effect of parameter
    substitution with no braces, so that the expression <b>$#</b> is treated as
    the parameter <b>$#</b> even if followed by a valid parameter name. When it
    is unset, zsh allows expressions of the form <b>$#</b><i>name</i> to refer
    to the length of <b>$</b><i>name</i>, even for special variables, for
    example in expressions such as <b>$#-</b> and <b>$#*</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Another difference is that with the option set assignment to an
    unset variable in arithmetic context causes the variable to be created as a
    scalar rather than a numeric type. So after `<b>unset t; (( t = 3</b>
    <b>))</b>'. without <b>POSIX_IDENTIFIERS</b> set <b>t</b> has integer type,
    while with it set it has scalar type.</p>
<p class="Pp">When the option is unset and multibyte character support is
    enabled (i.e. it is compiled in and the option <b>MULTIBYTE</b> is set),
    then additionally any alphanumeric characters in the local character set may
    be used in identifiers. Note that scripts and functions written with this
    feature are not portable, and also that both options must be set before the
    script or function is parsed; setting them during execution is not
    sufficient as the syntax <i>variable</i><b>=</b><i>value</i> has already
    been parsed as a command rather than an assignment.</p>
<p class="Pp">If multibyte character support is not compiled into the shell this
    option is ignored; all octets with the top bit set may be used in
    identifiers. This is non-standard but is the traditional zsh behaviour.</p>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>POSIX_STRINGS</b> &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt;</dt>
  <dd>This option affects processing of quoted strings. Currently it only
      affects the behaviour of null characters, i.e. character 0 in the portable
      character set corresponding to US ASCII.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">When this option is not set, null characters embedded within
    strings of the form <b>$'</b><i>...</i><b>'</b> are treated as ordinary
    characters. The entire string is maintained within the shell and output to
    files where necessary, although owing to restrictions of the library
    interface the string is truncated at the null character in file names,
    environment variables, or in arguments to external programs.</p>
<p class="Pp">When this option is set, the <b>$'</b><i>...</i><b>'</b>
    expression is truncated at the null character. Note that remaining parts of
    the same string beyond the termination of the quotes are not truncated.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, the command line argument <b>a$'b\0c'd</b> is treated
    with the option off as the characters <b>a</b>, <b>b</b>, null, <b>c</b>,
    <b>d</b>, and with the option on as the characters <b>a</b>, <b>b</b>,
    <b>d</b>.</p>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>POSIX_TRAPS</b> &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt;</dt>
  <dd>When this option is set, the usual zsh behaviour of executing traps for
      <b>EXIT</b> on exit from shell functions is suppressed. In that case,
      manipulating <b>EXIT</b> traps always alters the global trap for exiting
      the shell; the <b>LOCAL_TRAPS</b> option is ignored for the <b>EXIT</b>
      trap. Furthermore, a <b>return</b> statement executed in a trap with no
      argument passes back from the function the value from the surrounding
      context, not from code executed within the trap.</dd>
  <dt><b>SH_FILE_EXPANSION</b> &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt;</dt>
  <dd>Perform filename expansion (e.g., <b>~</b> expansion) <i>before</i>
      parameter expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion and brace
      expansion. If this option is unset, it is performed <i>after</i> brace
      expansion, so things like `<b>~$USERNAME</b>' and `<b>~{pfalstad,rc}</b>'
      will work.</dd>
  <dt><b>SH_NULLCMD</b> &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt;</dt>
  <dd>Do not use the values of <b>NULLCMD</b> and <b>READNULLCMD</b> when doing
      redirections, use `<b>:</b>' instead (see the section `Redirection').</dd>
  <dt><b>SH_OPTION_LETTERS</b> &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt;</dt>
  <dd>If this option is set the shell tries to interpret single letter options
      (which are used with <b>set</b> and <b>setopt</b>) like <b>ksh</b> does.
      This also affects the value of the <b>-</b> special parameter.</dd>
  <dt><b>SH_WORD_SPLIT</b> (<b>-y</b>) &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt;</dt>
  <dd>Causes field splitting to be performed on unquoted parameter expansions.
      Note that this option has nothing to do with word splitting. (See
      <i>zshexpn</i>(1).)</dd>
  <dt><b>TRAPS_ASYNC</b></dt>
  <dd>While waiting for a program to exit, handle signals and run traps
      immediately. Otherwise the trap is run after a child process has exited.
      Note this does not affect the point at which traps are run for any case
      other than when the shell is waiting for a child process.</dd>

      input. (See the discussion of <b>SHIN_STDIN</b>.) This heuristic may be
      overridden by specifying a state for this option on the command line. The

  <dt><b>LOGIN</b> (<b>-l</b>, ksh: <b>-l</b>)</dt>

      setting or unsetting this option on the command line does not necessarily
      affect the state the option will have while the shell is running - that is
      purely an indicator of whether or not commands are <i>actually</i> being

  <dt><b>SINGLE_COMMAND</b> (<b>-t</b>, ksh: <b>-t</b>)</dt>
