The dispatch I/O framework is an API for asynchronous read and write I/O
  operations. It is an application of the ideas and idioms present in the
  <a class="Xr">dispatch(3)</a> framework to device I/O. Dispatch I/O enables an
  application to more easily avoid blocking I/O operations and allows it to more
  directly express its I/O requirements than by using the raw POSIX file API.
  Dispatch I/O will make a best effort to optimize how and when asynchronous I/O
  operations are performed based on the capabilities of the targeted device.
<p class="Pp">This page provides details on how to create and configure dispatch
    I/O channels. Reading from and writing to these channels is covered in the
    <a class="Xr">dispatch_io_read(3)</a> page. The dispatch I/O framework also
    provides the convenience functions <a class="Xr">dispatch_read(3)</a> and
    <a class="Xr">dispatch_write(3)</a> for uses that do not require the full
    functionality provided by I/O channels.</p>

A dispatch I/O channel represents the asynchronous I/O policy applied to a file
  descriptor and encapsulates it for the purposes of ownership tracking while
  I/O operations are ongoing.
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="CHANNEL_TYPES"><a class="permalink" href="#CHANNEL_TYPES">CHANNEL
  TYPES</a></h1>
Dispatch I/O channels can have one of the following types:
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag Bl-compact">
  <dt>DISPATCH_IO_STREAM</dt>
  <dd>channels that represent a stream of bytes and do not support reads and
      writes at arbitrary offsets, such as pipes or sockets. Channels of this
      type perform read and write operations sequentially at the current file
      pointer position and ignore any offset specified. Depending on the
      underlying file descriptor, read operations may be performed
      simultaneously with write operations.</dd>
  <dt>DISPATCH_IO_RANDOM</dt>
  <dd>channels that represent random access files on disk. Only supported for
      seekable file descriptors and paths. Channels of this type may perform
      submitted read and write operations concurrently at the specified offset
      (interpreted relative to the position of the file pointer when the channel
      was created).</dd>
</dl>
</div>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="CHANNEL_OPENING_AND_CLOSING"><a class="permalink" href="#CHANNEL_OPENING_AND_CLOSING">CHANNEL
  OPENING AND CLOSING</a></h1>
The <code class="Fn">dispatch_io_create</code>() and
  <code class="Fn">dispatch_io_create_with_path</code>() functions create a
  dispatch I/O channel of provided <var class="Fa">type</var> from a file
  descriptor <var class="Fa">fd</var> or an absolute pathname, respectively.
  They can be thought of as analogous to the <a class="Xr">fdopen(3)</a> POSIX
  function and the <a class="Xr">fopen(3)</a> function in the standard C
  library. For a channel created from a pathname, the provided
  <var class="Fa">path</var>, <var class="Fa">oflag</var> and
  <var class="Fa">mode</var> parameters will be passed to
  <a class="Xr">open(2)</a> when the first I/O operation on the channel is ready
  to execute.
<p class="Pp">The provided <var class="Fa">cleanup_handler</var> block will be
    submitted to the specified <var class="Fa">queue</var> when all I/O
    operations on the channel have completed and it is closed or reaches the end
    of its lifecycle. If an error occurs during channel creation, the
    <var class="Fa">cleanup_handler</var> block will be submitted immediately
    and passed an <var class="Fa">error</var> parameter with the POSIX error
    encountered. If an invalid <var class="Fa">type</var> or a non-absolute
    <var class="Fa">path</var> argument is specified, these functions will
    return NULL and the <var class="Fa">cleanup_handler</var> will not be
    invoked. After successfully creating a dispatch I/O channel from a file
    descriptor, the application must take care not to modify that file
    descriptor until the associated <var class="Fa">cleanup_handler</var> is
    invoked, see <a class="Sx" href="#FILEDESCRIPTOR_OWNERSHIP">FILEDESCRIPTOR
    OWNERSHIP</a> for details.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <code class="Fn">dispatch_io_close</code>() function closes a
    dispatch I/O channel to new submissions of I/O operations. If
    <code class="Dv">DISPATCH_IO_STOP</code> is passed in the
    <var class="Fa">flags</var> parameter, the system will in addition not
    perform the I/O operations already submitted to the channel that are still
    pending and will make a best effort to interrupt any ongoing operations.
    Handlers for operations so affected will be passed the
    <code class="Er">ECANCELED</code> error code, along with any partial
    results.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="CHANNEL_CONFIGURATION"><a class="permalink" href="#CHANNEL_CONFIGURATION">CHANNEL
  CONFIGURATION</a></h1>
Dispatch I/O channels have high-water mark, low-water mark and interval
  configuration settings that determine if and when partial results from I/O
  operations are delivered via their associated I/O handlers.
<p class="Pp">The <code class="Fn">dispatch_io_set_high_water</code>() and
    <code class="Fn">dispatch_io_set_low_water</code>() functions configure the
    water mark settings of a <var class="Fa">channel</var>. The system will read
    or write at least the number of bytes specified by
    <var class="Fa">low_water</var> before submitting an I/O handler with
    partial results, and will make a best effort to submit an I/O handler as
    soon as the number of bytes read or written reaches
    <var class="Fa">high_water</var>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <code class="Fn">dispatch_io_set_interval</code>() function
    configures the time <var class="Fa">interval</var> at which I/O handlers are
    submitted (measured in nanoseconds). If
    <code class="Dv">DISPATCH_IO_STRICT_INTERVAL</code> is passed in the
    <var class="Fa">flags</var> parameter, the interval will be strictly
    observed even if there is an insufficient amount of data to deliver;
    otherwise delivery will be skipped for intervals where the amount of
    available data is inferior to the channel's low-water mark. Note that the
    system may defer enqueueing interval I/O handlers by a small unspecified
    amount of leeway in order to align with other system activity for improved
    system performance or power consumption.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DATA_DELIVERY"><a class="permalink" href="#DATA_DELIVERY">DATA
  DELIVERY</a></h1>
The size of data objects passed to I/O handlers for a channel will never be
  larger than the high-water mark set on the channel; it will also never be
  smaller than the low-water mark, except in the following cases:
<ul class="Bl-dash Bd-indent Bl-compact">
  <li>the final handler invocation for an I/O operation</li>
  <li>EOF was encountered</li>
  <li>the channel has an interval with the
      <code class="Dv">DISPATCH_IO_STRICT_INTERVAL</code> flag set</li>
</ul>
Bear in mind that dispatch I/O channels will typically deliver amounts of data
  significantly higher than the low-water mark. The default value for the
  low-water mark is unspecified, but must be assumed to allow intermediate
  handler invocations. The default value for the high-water mark is unlimited
  (i.e. <code class="Dv">SIZE_MAX</code>). Channels that require intermediate
  results of fixed size should have both the low-water and the high-water mark
  set to that size. Channels that do not wish to receive any intermediate
  results should have the low-water mark set to
  <code class="Dv">SIZE_MAX</code>.
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="FILEDESCRIPTOR_OWNERSHIP"><a class="permalink" href="#FILEDESCRIPTOR_OWNERSHIP">FILEDESCRIPTOR
  OWNERSHIP</a></h1>
When an application creates a dispatch I/O channel from a file descriptor with
  the <code class="Fn">dispatch_io_create</code>() function, the system takes
  control of that file descriptor until the channel is closed, an error occurs
  on the file descriptor or all references to the channel are released. At that
  time the channel's cleanup handler will be enqueued and control over the file
  descriptor relinquished, making it safe for the application to
  <a class="Xr">close(2)</a> the file descriptor. While a file descriptor is
  under the control of a dispatch I/O channel, file descriptor flags such as
  <code class="Dv">O_NONBLOCK</code> will be modified by the system on behalf of
  the application. It is an error for the application to modify a file
  descriptor directly while it is under the control of a dispatch I/O channel,
  but it may create further I/O channels from that file descriptor or use the
  <a class="Xr">dispatch_read(3)</a> and <a class="Xr">dispatch_write(3)</a>
  convenience functions with that file descriptor. If multiple I/O channels have
  been created from the same file descriptor, all the associated cleanup
  handlers will be submitted together once the last channel has been closed
  resp. all references to those channels have been released. If convenience
  functions have also been used on that file descriptor, submission of their
  handlers will be tied to the submission of the channel cleanup handlers as
  well.

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="BARRIER_OPERATIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#BARRIER_OPERATIONS">BARRIER
  OPERATIONS</a></h1>
The <code class="Fn">dispatch_io_barrier</code>() function schedules a barrier
  operation on an I/O channel. The specified barrier block will be run once,
  after all current I/O operations (such as <a class="Xr">read(2)</a> or
  <a class="Xr">write(2)</a>) on the underlying file descriptor have finished.
  No new I/O operations will start until the barrier block finishes.
<p class="Pp">The barrier block may operate on the underlying file descriptor
    with functions like <a class="Xr">fsync(2)</a> or
    <a class="Xr">lseek(2)</a>. As discussed in the
    <a class="Sx" href="#FILEDESCRIPTOR_OWNERSHIP">FILEDESCRIPTOR OWNERSHIP</a>
    section, the barrier block must not <a class="Xr">close(2)</a> the file
    descriptor, and if it changes any flags on the file descriptor, it must
    restore them before finishing.</p>
<p class="Pp">There is no synchronization between a barrier block and any
    <a class="Xr">dispatch_io_read(3)</a> or
    <a class="Xr">dispatch_io_write(3)</a> handler blocks; they may be running
    at the same time. The barrier block itself is responsible for any required
    synchronization.</p>
