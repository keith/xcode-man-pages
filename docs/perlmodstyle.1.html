<h1 class="Sh" id="INTRODUCTION"><a class="permalink" href="#INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">This document attempts to describe the Perl Community's &quot;best
    practice&quot; for writing Perl modules. It extends the recommendations
    found in perlstyle , which should be considered required reading before
    reading this document.</p>
<p class="Pp">While this document is intended to be useful to all module
    authors, it is particularly aimed at authors who wish to publish their
    modules on CPAN.</p>
<p class="Pp">The focus is on elements of style which are visible to the users
    of a module, rather than those parts which are only seen by the module's
    developers. However, many of the guidelines presented in this document can
    be extrapolated and applied successfully to a module's internals.</p>
<p class="Pp">This document differs from perlnewmod in that it is a style guide
    rather than a tutorial on creating CPAN modules. It provides a checklist
    against which modules can be compared to determine whether they conform to
    best practice, without necessarily describing in detail how to achieve
  this.</p>
<p class="Pp">All the advice contained in this document has been gleaned from
    extensive conversations with experienced CPAN authors and users. Every piece
    of advice given here is the result of previous mistakes. This information is
    here to help you avoid the same mistakes and the extra work that would
    inevitably be required to fix them.</p>
<p class="Pp">The first section of this document provides an itemized checklist;
    subsequent sections provide a more detailed discussion of the items on the
    list. The final section, &quot;Common Pitfalls&quot;, describes some of the
    most popular mistakes made by CPAN authors.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="BEFORE_YOU_START_WRITING_A_MODULE"><a class="permalink" href="#BEFORE_YOU_START_WRITING_A_MODULE">BEFORE
  YOU START WRITING A MODULE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Try not to launch headlong into developing your module without
    spending some time thinking first. A little forethought may save you a vast
    amount of effort later on.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Has_it_been_done_before?"><a class="permalink" href="#Has_it_been_done_before?">Has
  it been done before?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">You may not even need to write the module. Check whether it's
    already been done in Perl, and avoid re-inventing the wheel unless you have
    a good reason.</p>
<p class="Pp">Good places to look for pre-existing modules include MetaCPAN
    &lt;https://metacpan.org&gt; and PrePAN &lt;http://prepan.org&gt; and asking
    on <span class="Li">&quot;module-authors@perl.org&quot;</span>
    (&lt;https://lists.perl.org/list/module-authors.html&gt;).</p>
<p class="Pp">If an existing module <b>almost</b> does what you want, consider
    writing a patch, writing a subclass, or otherwise extending the existing
    module rather than rewriting it.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Do_one_thing_and_do_it_well"><a class="permalink" href="#Do_one_thing_and_do_it_well">Do
  one thing and do it well</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">At the risk of stating the obvious, modules are intended to be
    modular. A Perl developer should be able to use modules to put together the
    building blocks of their application. However, it's important that the
    blocks are the right shape, and that the developer shouldn't have to use a
    big block when all they need is a small one.</p>
<p class="Pp">Your module should have a clearly defined scope which is no longer
    than a single sentence. Can your module be broken down into a family of
    related modules?</p>
<p class="Pp">Bad example:</p>
<p class="Pp">&quot;FooBar.pm provides an implementation of the FOO protocol and
    the related BAR standard.&quot;</p>
<p class="Pp">Good example:</p>
<p class="Pp">&quot;Foo.pm provides an implementation of the FOO protocol.
    Bar.pm implements the related BAR protocol.&quot;</p>
<p class="Pp">This means that if a developer only needs a module for the BAR
    standard, they should not be forced to install libraries for FOO as
  well.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="What's_in_a_name?"><a class="permalink" href="#What's_in_a_name?">What's
  in a name?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Make sure you choose an appropriate name for your module early on.
    This will help people find and remember your module, and make programming
    with your module more intuitive.</p>
<p class="Pp">When naming your module, consider the following:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Be descriptive (i.e. accurately describes the purpose of the module).</li>
  <li>Be consistent with existing modules.</li>
  <li>Reflect the functionality of the module, not the implementation.</li>
  <li>Avoid starting a new top-level hierarchy, especially if a suitable
      hierarchy already exists under which you could place your module.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Get_feedback_before_publishing"><a class="permalink" href="#Get_feedback_before_publishing">Get
  feedback before publishing</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">If you have never uploaded a module to CPAN before (and even if
    you have), you are strongly encouraged to get feedback on PrePAN
    &lt;http://prepan.org&gt;. PrePAN is a site dedicated to discussing ideas
    for CPAN modules with other Perl developers and is a great resource for new
    (and experienced) Perl developers.</p>
<p class="Pp">You should also try to get feedback from people who are already
    familiar with the module's application domain and the CPAN naming system.
    Authors of similar modules, or modules with similar names, may be a good
    place to start, as are community sites like Perl Monks
    &lt;https://www.perlmonks.org&gt;.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="DESIGNING_AND_WRITING_YOUR_MODULE"><a class="permalink" href="#DESIGNING_AND_WRITING_YOUR_MODULE">DESIGNING
  AND WRITING YOUR MODULE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Considerations for module design and coding:</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="To_"><a class="permalink" href="#To_">To OO or not to
  OO?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Your module may be object oriented (OO) or not, or it may have
    both kinds of interfaces available. There are pros and cons of each
    technique, which should be considered when you design your API.</p>
<p class="Pp">In <i>Perl Best Practices</i> (copyright 2004, Published by
    O'Reilly Media, Inc.), Damian Conway provides a list of criteria to use when
    deciding if OO is the right fit for your problem:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>The system being designed is large, or is likely to become large.</li>
  <li>The data can be aggregated into obvious structures, especially if there's
      a large amount of data in each aggregate.</li>
  <li>The various types of data aggregate form a natural hierarchy that
      facilitates the use of inheritance and polymorphism.</li>
  <li>You have a piece of data on which many different operations are
    applied.</li>
  <li>You need to perform the same general operations on related types of data,
      but with slight variations depending on the specific type of data the
      operations are applied to.</li>
  <li>It's likely you'll have to add new data types later.</li>
  <li>The typical interactions between pieces of data are best represented by
      operators.</li>
  <li>The implementation of individual components of the system is likely to
      change over time.</li>
  <li>The system design is already object-oriented.</li>
  <li>Large numbers of other programmers will be using your code modules.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">Think carefully about whether OO is appropriate for your module.
    Gratuitous object orientation results in complex APIs which are difficult
    for the average module user to understand or use.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Designing_your_"><a class="permalink" href="#Designing_your_">Designing
  your API</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Your interfaces should be understandable by an average Perl
    programmer. The following guidelines may help you judge whether your API is
    sufficiently straightforward:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="Write"><a class="permalink" href="#Write">Write simple routines to do
    simple things.</a></dt>
  <dd>It's better to have numerous simple routines than a few monolithic ones.
      If your routine changes its behaviour significantly based on its
      arguments, it's a sign that you should have two (or more) separate
      routines.</dd>
  <dt id="Separate"><a class="permalink" href="#Separate">Separate functionality
    from output.</a></dt>
  <dd>Return your results in the most generic form possible and allow the user
      to choose how to use them. The most generic form possible is usually a
      Perl data structure which can then be used to generate a text report,
      HTML, XML, a database query, or whatever else your users require.
    <p class="Pp">If your routine iterates through some kind of list (such as a
        list of files, or records in a database) you may consider providing a
        callback so that users can manipulate each element of the list in turn.
        File::Find provides an example of this with its
        <span class="Li">&quot;find(\&amp;wanted, $dir)&quot;</span> syntax.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="Provide"><a class="permalink" href="#Provide">Provide sensible
    shortcuts and defaults.</a></dt>
  <dd>Don't require every module user to jump through the same hoops to achieve
      a simple result. You can always include optional parameters or routines
      for more complex or non-standard behaviour. If most of your users have to
      type a few almost identical lines of code when they start using your
      module, it's a sign that you should have made that behaviour a default.
      Another good indicator that you should use defaults is if most of your
      users call your routines with the same arguments.</dd>
  <dt id="Naming"><a class="permalink" href="#Naming">Naming
    conventions</a></dt>
  <dd>Your naming should be consistent. For instance, it's better to have:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>        display_day();
        display_week();
        display_year();
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">than</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>        display_day();
        week_display();
        show_year();
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This applies equally to method names, parameter names, and
        anything else which is visible to the user (and most things that
        aren't!)</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="Parameter"><a class="permalink" href="#Parameter">Parameter
    passing</a></dt>
  <dd>Use named parameters. It's easier to use a hash like this:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    $obj-&gt;do_something(
            name =&gt; &quot;wibble&quot;,
            type =&gt; &quot;text&quot;,
            size =&gt; 1024,
    );
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">... than to have a long list of unnamed parameters like
      this:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    $obj-&gt;do_something(&quot;wibble&quot;, &quot;text&quot;, 1024);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">While the list of arguments might work fine for one, two or
        even three arguments, any more arguments become hard for the module user
        to remember, and hard for the module author to manage. If you want to
        add a new parameter you will have to add it to the end of the list for
        backward compatibility, and this will probably make your list order
        unintuitive. Also, if many elements may be undefined you may see the
        following unattractive method calls:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    $obj-&gt;do_something(undef, undef, undef, undef, undef, 1024);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Provide sensible defaults for parameters which have them.
        Don't make your users specify parameters which will almost always be the
        same.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The issue of whether to pass the arguments in a hash or a
        hashref is largely a matter of personal style.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The use of hash keys starting with a hyphen
        (<span class="Li">&quot;-name&quot;</span>) or entirely in upper case
        (<span class="Li">&quot;NAME&quot;</span>) is a relic of older versions
        of Perl in which ordinary lower case strings were not handled correctly
        by the <span class="Li">&quot;=&gt;&quot;</span> operator. While some
        modules retain uppercase or hyphenated argument keys for historical
        reasons or as a matter of personal style, most new modules should use
        simple lower case keys. Whatever you choose, be consistent!</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Strictness_and_warnings"><a class="permalink" href="#Strictness_and_warnings">Strictness
  and warnings</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Your module should run successfully under the strict pragma and
    should run without generating any warnings. Your module should also handle
    taint-checking where appropriate, though this can cause difficulties in many
    cases.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Backwards_compatibility"><a class="permalink" href="#Backwards_compatibility">Backwards
  compatibility</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Modules which are &quot;stable&quot; should not break backwards
    compatibility without at least a long transition phase and a major change in
    version number.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Error_handling_and_messages"><a class="permalink" href="#Error_handling_and_messages">Error
  handling and messages</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">When your module encounters an error it should do one or more
  of:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Return an undefined value.</li>
  <li>set <span class="Li">$Module::errstr</span> or similar
      (<span class="Li">&quot;errstr&quot;</span> is a common name used by DBI
      and other popular modules; if you choose something else, be sure to
      document it clearly).</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;warn()&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;carp()&quot;</span> a message to STDERR.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;croak()&quot;</span> only when your module
      absolutely cannot figure out what to do.
      (<span class="Li">&quot;croak()&quot;</span> is a better version of
      <span class="Li">&quot;die()&quot;</span> for use within modules, which
      reports its errors from the perspective of the caller. See Carp for
      details of <span class="Li">&quot;croak()&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;carp()&quot;</span> and other useful
    routines.)</li>
  <li>As an alternative to the above, you may prefer to throw exceptions using
      the Error module.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">Configurable error handling can be very useful to your users.
    Consider offering a choice of levels for warning and debug messages, an
    option to send messages to a separate file, a way to specify an
    error-handling routine, or other such features. Be sure to default all these
    options to the commonest use.</p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DOCUMENTING_YOUR_MODULE"><a class="permalink" href="#DOCUMENTING_YOUR_MODULE">DOCUMENTING
  YOUR MODULE</a></h1>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">POD</h2>
<p class="Pp">Your module should include documentation aimed at Perl developers.
    You should use Perl's &quot;plain old documentation&quot; (POD) for your
    general technical documentation, though you may wish to write additional
    documentation (white papers, tutorials, etc) in some other format. You need
    to cover the following subjects:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>A synopsis of the common uses of the module</li>
  <li>The purpose, scope and target applications of your module</li>
  <li>Use of each publicly accessible method or subroutine, including parameters
      and return values</li>
  <li>Examples of use</li>
  <li>Sources of further information</li>
  <li>A contact email address for the author/maintainer</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">The level of detail in Perl module documentation generally goes
    from less detailed to more detailed. Your SYNOPSIS section should contain a
    minimal example of use (perhaps as little as one line of code; skip the
    unusual use cases or anything not needed by most users); the DESCRIPTION
    should describe your module in broad terms, generally in just a few
    paragraphs; more detail of the module's routines or methods, lengthy code
    examples, or other in-depth material should be given in subsequent
  sections.</p>
<p class="Pp">Ideally, someone who's slightly familiar with your module should
    be able to refresh their memory without hitting &quot;page down&quot;. As
    your reader continues through the document, they should receive a
    progressively greater amount of knowledge.</p>
<p class="Pp">The recommended order of sections in Perl module documentation
  is:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>NAME</li>
  <li>SYNOPSIS</li>
  <li>DESCRIPTION</li>
  <li>One or more sections or subsections giving greater detail of available
      methods and routines and any other relevant information.</li>
  <li>BUGS/CAVEATS/etc</li>
  <li>AUTHOR</li>
  <li>SEE ALSO</li>
  <li>COPYRIGHT and LICENSE</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">Keep your documentation near the code it documents
    (&quot;inline&quot; documentation). Include POD for a given method right
    above that method's subroutine. This makes it easier to keep the
    documentation up to date, and avoids having to document each piece of code
    twice (once in POD and once in comments).</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">README, INSTALL, release notes, changelogs</h2>
<p class="Pp">Your module should also include a README file describing the
    module and giving pointers to further information (website, author
  email).</p>
<p class="Pp">An INSTALL file should be included, and should contain simple
    installation instructions. When using ExtUtils::MakeMaker this will usually
    be:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="perl"><a class="permalink" href="#perl">perl Makefile.PL</a></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt id="make"><a class="permalink" href="#make">make</a></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>make test</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>make install</dt>
  <dd></dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">When using Module::Build, this will usually be:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="perl~2"><a class="permalink" href="#perl~2">perl Build.PL</a></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt id="perl~3"><a class="permalink" href="#perl~3">perl Build</a></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt id="perl~4"><a class="permalink" href="#perl~4">perl Build test</a></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt id="perl~5"><a class="permalink" href="#perl~5">perl Build
    install</a></dt>
  <dd></dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Release notes or changelogs should be produced for each release of
    your software describing user-visible changes to your module, in terms
    relevant to the user.</p>
<p class="Pp">Unless you have good reasons for using some other format (for
    example, a format used within your company), the convention is to name your
    changelog file <span class="Li">&quot;Changes&quot;</span>, and to follow
    the simple format described in CPAN::Changes::Spec.</p>

  CONSIDERATIONS</a></h1>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Version_numbering"><a class="permalink" href="#Version_numbering">Version
  numbering</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Version numbers should indicate at least major and minor releases,
    and possibly sub-minor releases. A major release is one in which most of the
    functionality has changed, or in which major new functionality is added. A
    minor release is one in which a small amount of functionality has been added
    or changed. Sub-minor version numbers are usually used for changes which do
    not affect functionality, such as documentation patches.</p>
<p class="Pp">The most common CPAN version numbering scheme looks like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    1.00, 1.10, 1.11, 1.20, 1.30, 1.31, 1.32
</pre>
<p class="Pp">A correct CPAN version number is a floating point number with at
    least 2 digits after the decimal. You can test whether it conforms to CPAN
    by using</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    perl -MExtUtils::MakeMaker -le 'print MM-&gt;parse_version(shift)' \
                                                            'Foo.pm'
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If you want to release a 'beta' or 'alpha' version of a module but
    don't want CPAN.pm to list it as most recent use an '_' after the regular
    version number followed by at least 2 digits, eg. 1.20_01. If you do this,
    the following idiom is recommended:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  our $VERSION = &quot;1.12_01&quot;; # so CPAN distribution will have
                            # right filename
  our $XS_VERSION = $VERSION; # only needed if you have XS code
  $VERSION = eval $VERSION; # so &quot;use Module 0.002&quot; won't warn on
                            # underscore
</pre>
<p class="Pp">With that trick MakeMaker will only read the first line and thus
    read the underscore, while the perl interpreter will evaluate the
    <span class="Li">$VERSION</span> and convert the string into a number. Later
    operations that treat <span class="Li">$VERSION</span> as a number will then
    be able to do so without provoking a warning about
    <span class="Li">$VERSION</span> not being a number.</p>
<p class="Pp">Never release anything (even a one-word documentation patch)
    without incrementing the number. Even a one-word documentation patch should
    result in a change in version at the sub-minor level.</p>
<p class="Pp">Once picked, it is important to stick to your version scheme,
    without reducing the number of digits. This is because
    &quot;downstream&quot; packagers, such as the FreeBSD ports system,
    interpret the version numbers in various ways. If you change the number of
    digits in your version scheme, you can confuse these systems so they get the
    versions of your module out of order, which is obviously bad.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Pre-requisites"><a class="permalink" href="#Pre-requisites">Pre-requisites</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Module authors should carefully consider whether to rely on other
    modules, and which modules to rely on.</p>
<p class="Pp">Most importantly, choose modules which are as stable as possible.
    In order of preference:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Core Perl modules</li>
  <li>Stable CPAN modules</li>
  <li>Unstable CPAN modules</li>
  <li>Modules not available from CPAN</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">Specify version requirements for other Perl modules in the
    pre-requisites in your Makefile.PL or Build.PL.</p>
<p class="Pp">Be sure to specify Perl version requirements both in Makefile.PL
    or Build.PL and with <span class="Li">&quot;require 5.6.1&quot;</span> or
    similar. See the section on <span class="Li">&quot;use VERSION&quot;</span>
    of &quot;require&quot; in perlfunc for details.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Testing"><a class="permalink" href="#Testing">Testing</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">All modules should be tested before distribution (using &quot;make
    disttest&quot;), and the tests should also be available to people installing
    the modules (using &quot;make test&quot;). For Module::Build you would use
    the <span class="Li">&quot;make test&quot;</span> equivalent
    <span class="Li">&quot;perl Build test&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The importance of these tests is proportional to the alleged
    stability of a module. A module which purports to be stable or which hopes
    to achieve wide use should adhere to as strict a testing regime as
  possible.</p>
<p class="Pp">Useful modules to help you write tests (with minimum impact on
    your development process or your time) include Test::Simple, Carp::Assert
    and Test::Inline. For more sophisticated test suites there are Test::More
    and Test::MockObject.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Packaging"><a class="permalink" href="#Packaging">Packaging</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Modules should be packaged using one of the standard packaging
    tools. Currently you have the choice between ExtUtils::MakeMaker and the
    more platform independent Module::Build, allowing modules to be installed in
    a consistent manner. When using ExtUtils::MakeMaker, you can use &quot;make
    dist&quot; to create your package. Tools exist to help you to build your
    module in a MakeMaker-friendly style. These include ExtUtils::ModuleMaker
    and h2xs. See also perlnewmod.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Licensing"><a class="permalink" href="#Licensing">Licensing</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Make sure that your module has a license, and that the full text
    of it is included in the distribution (unless it's a common one and the
    terms of the license don't require you to include it).</p>
<p class="Pp">If you don't know what license to use, dual licensing under the
    GPL and Artistic licenses (the same as Perl itself) is a good idea. See
    perlgpl and perlartistic.</p>

<p class="Pp">There are certain application spaces which are already very, very
    well served by CPAN. One example is templating systems, another is date and
    time modules, and there are many more. While it is a rite of passage to
    write your own version of these things, please consider carefully whether
    the Perl world really needs you to publish it.</p>

<p class="Pp">Your module will be part of a developer's toolkit. It will not, in
    itself, form the <b>entire</b> toolkit. It's tempting to add extra features
    until your code is a monolithic system rather than a set of modular building
    blocks.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Inappropriate_documentation"><a class="permalink" href="#Inappropriate_documentation">Inappropriate
  documentation</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Don't fall into the trap of writing for the wrong audience. Your
    primary audience is a reasonably experienced developer with at least a
    moderate understanding of your module's application domain, who's just
    downloaded your module and wants to start using it as quickly as
  possible.</p>
<p class="Pp">Tutorials, end-user documentation, research papers, FAQs etc are
    not appropriate in a module's main documentation. If you really want to
    write these, include them as sub-documents such as
    <span class="Li">&quot;My::Module::Tutorial&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;My::Module::FAQ&quot;</span> and provide a link in
    the SEE ALSO section of the main documentation.</p>
