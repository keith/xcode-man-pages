<h2 class="Ss" id="Overloaded_Operators"><a class="permalink" href="#Overloaded_Operators">Overloaded
  Operators</a></h2>
Many operators have been overloaded, as described below:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>Assignment (</b><b>&quot;=&quot;</b><b>)</b></dt>
  <dd>Has been optimized to copy one NetAddr::IP object to another very
    quickly.</dd>
  <dt><b></b><b>&quot;-&gt;copy()&quot;</b><b></b></dt>
  <dd>The <b>assignment (</b><b>&quot;=&quot;</b><b>)</b> operation is only put
      in to operation when the copied object is further mutated by another
      overloaded operation. See overload <b>SPECIAL SYMBOLS FOR &quot;use
      overload&quot;</b> for details.
    <p class="Pp"><b></b><b>&quot;-&gt;copy()&quot;</b><b></b> actually creates
        a new object when called.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>Stringification</b></dt>
  <dd>An object can be used just as a string. For instance, the following code
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
        my $ip = new NetAddr::IP '192.168.1.123';
        print &quot;$ip\n&quot;;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Will print the string 192.168.1.123/32.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>Equality</b></dt>
  <dd>You can test for equality with either
      <span class="Li">&quot;eq&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;==&quot;</span>.
      <span class="Li">&quot;eq&quot;</span> allows comparison with arbitrary
      strings as well as NetAddr::IP objects. The following example:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    if (NetAddr::IP-&gt;new('127.0.0.1','255.0.0.0') eq '127.0.0.1/8')
       { print &quot;Yes\n&quot;; }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">will print out &quot;Yes&quot;.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Comparison with <span class="Li">&quot;==&quot;</span>
        requires both operands to be NetAddr::IP objects.</p>
    <p class="Pp">In both cases, a true value is returned if the CIDR
        representation of the operands is equal.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>Comparison via &gt;, &lt;, &gt;=, &lt;=, &lt;=&gt; and
    </b><b>&quot;cmp&quot;</b><b></b></dt>
  <dd>Internally, all network objects are represented in 128 bit format. The
      numeric representation of the network is compared through the
      corresponding operation. Comparisons are tried first on the address
      portion of the object and if that is equal then the NUMERIC cidr portion
      of the masks are compared. This leads to the counterintuitive result that
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
        /24 &gt; /16
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Comparison should not be done on netaddr objects with
        different CIDR as this may produce indeterminate - unexpected results,
        rather the determination of which netblock is larger or smaller should
        be done by comparing</p>

        $ip1-&gt;masklen &lt;=&gt; $ip2-&gt;masklen
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>Addition of a constant (</b><b>&quot;+&quot;</b><b>)</b></dt>
  <dd>Add a 32 bit signed constant to the address part of a NetAddr object. This
      operation changes the address part to point so many hosts above the
      current objects start address. For instance, this code:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    print NetAddr::IP-&gt;new('127.0.0.1/8') + 5;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">will output 127.0.0.6/8. The address will wrap around at the
        broadcast back to the network address. This code:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    print NetAddr::IP-&gt;new('10.0.0.1/24') + 255;

    outputs 10.0.0.0/24.
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Returns the the unchanged object when the constant is missing
        or out of range.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    2147483647 &lt;= constant &gt;= -2147483648
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>Subtraction of a constant (</b><b>&quot;-&quot;</b><b>)</b></dt>
  <dd>The complement of the addition of a constant.</dd>
  <dt><b>Difference (</b><b>&quot;-&quot;</b><b>)</b></dt>
  <dd>Returns the difference between the address parts of two NetAddr::IP
      objects address parts as a 32 bit signed number.
    <p class="Pp">Returns <b>undef</b> if the difference is out of range.</p>
    <p class="Pp">(See range restrictions on Addition above)</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>Auto-increment</b></dt>
  <dd>Auto-incrementing a NetAddr::IP object causes the address part to be
      adjusted to the next host address within the subnet. It will wrap at the
      broadcast address and start again from the network address.</dd>
  <dt><b>Auto-decrement</b></dt>
  <dd>Auto-decrementing a NetAddr::IP object performs exactly the opposite of
      auto-incrementing it, as you would expect.</dd>

  <dt>&quot;-&gt;addr()&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Returns a scalar with the address part of the object as an IPv4 or IPv6
      text string as appropriate. This is useful for printing or for passing the

      <span class="Li">&quot;ipv6_aton&quot;</span> function respectively. If

  <dd>Returns a scalar with the address and mask in ipV4 prefix representation.
      This is useful for some programs, which expect its input to be in this

    encoding.</dd>

  <dt>&quot;-&gt;numeric()&quot;</dt>
  <dd>When called in a scalar context, will return a numeric representation of
      the address part of the IP address. When called in an array contest, it
      returns a list of two elements. The first element is as described, the
      second element is the numeric representation of the netmask.

  <dt>&quot;-&gt;bigint()&quot;</dt>
