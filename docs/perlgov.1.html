</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="PREAMBLE"><a class="permalink" href="#PREAMBLE">PREAMBLE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">We are forming a system of governance for development of the Perl
    programming language.</p>
<p class="Pp">The scope of governance includes the language definition, its
    implementation, its test suite, its documentation, and the policies and
    procedures by which it is developed and maintained.</p>
<p class="Pp">The system of governance includes definitions of the groups that
    will make decisions, the rules by which these groups are formed and changed,
    and the enumerated powers and constraints on the activities of these
    governing groups.</p>
<p class="Pp">In forming a system of governance, we seek to achieve the
    following goals:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>We want a system that is functional. That means the governing groups may
      decide to undertake large changes, or they may decide to act
      conservatively, but they will act with intent and clear communication
      rather than fail to reach decisions when needed.</li>
  <li>We want a system that is trusted. That means that a reasonable contributor
      to Perl might disagree with decisions made by the governing groups, but
      will accept that they were made in good faith in consultation with
      relevant communities outside the governing groups.</li>
  <li>We want a system that is sustainable. That means it has provisions to
      self-modify, including ways of adding new members to the governing groups,
      ways to survive members becoming inactive, and ways of amending the rules
      of governance themselves if needed.</li>
  <li>We want a system that is transparent. That means that it will prefer
      policies that manage ordinary matters in public, and it will prefer
      secrecy in a limited number of situations.</li>
  <li>We want a system that is respectful. That means that it will establish
      standards of civil discourse that allow for healthy disagreement but avoid
      rancor and hostility in the community for which it is responsible.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="Mandate"><a class="permalink" href="#Mandate">Mandate</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Perl language governance shall work to:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Maintain the quality, stability, and continuity of the Perl language and
      interpreter</li>
  <li>Guide the evolution of the Perl language and interpreter</li>
  <li>Establish and oversee the policies, procedures, systems, and mechanisms
      that enable a community of contributors to the Perl language and
      interpreter</li>
  <li>Encourage discussion and consensus among contributors as preferential to
      formal decision making by governance groups</li>
  <li>Facilitate communication between contributors and external stakeholders in
      the broader Perl ecosystem</li>
</ul>

<p class="Pp">This document describes three roles involved in governance:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>&quot;Core Team&quot;</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>&quot;Steering Council&quot;</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>&quot;Vote Administrator&quot;</dt>
  <dd></dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">A section on each follows.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="The_Core_Team"><a class="permalink" href="#The_Core_Team">The
  Core Team</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The Core Team are a group of trusted volunteers involved in the
    ongoing development of the Perl language and interpreter. They are not
    required to be language developers or committers.</p>
<p class="Pp">References to specific votes are explained in the &quot;Rules for
    Voting&quot; section.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Powers</i></p>
<p class="Pp">In addition to their contributions to the Perl language, the Core
    Team sets the rules of Perl governance, decides who participates in what
    role in governance, and delegates substantial decision making power to the
    Steering Council.</p>
<p class="Pp">Specifically:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>They elect the Steering Council and have the power to remove Steering
      Council members.</li>
  <li>In concert with the Steering Council, they manage Core Team
    membership.</li>
  <li>In concert with the Steering Council, they have the power to modify the
      Perl Rules of Governance.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">The Core Team do not have any authority over parts of the Perl
    ecosystem unrelated to developing and releasing the language itself. These
    include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>The Perl Foundation</li>
  <li>CPAN administration and CPAN authors</li>
  <li>perl.org, metacpan.org, and other community-maintained websites and
      services</li>
  <li>Perl conferences and events, except those organized directly by the Core
      Team</li>
  <li>Perl-related intellectual property legally owned by third-parties, except
      as allowed by applicable licenses or agreements</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp"><i>Membership</i></p>
<p class="Pp">The initial Core Team members will be specified when this document
    is first ratified.</p>
<p class="Pp">Any Core Team member may nominate someone to be added to the Core
    Team by sending the nomination to the Steering Council. The Steering Council
    must approve or reject the nomination. If approved, the Steering Council
    will organize a Membership Change Vote to ratify the addition.</p>
<p class="Pp">Core Team members should demonstrate:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>A solid track record of being constructive and helpful</li>
  <li>Significant contributions to the project's goals, in any form</li>
  <li>Willingness to dedicate some time to improving Perl</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">Contributions are not limited to code. Here is an incomplete list
    of areas where contributions may be considered for joining the Core
  Team:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Working on community management and outreach</li>
  <li>Providing support on mailing lists, IRC, or other forums</li>
  <li>Triaging tickets</li>
  <li>Writing patches (code, docs, or tests)</li>
  <li>Reviewing patches (code, docs, or tests)</li>
  <li>Participating in design discussions</li>
  <li>Providing expertise in a particular domain (security, i18n, etc.)</li>
  <li>Managing Perl infrastructure (websites, CI, documentation, etc.)</li>
  <li>Maintaining significant projects in the Perl ecosystem</li>
  <li>Creating visual designs</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">Core Team membership acknowledges sustained and valuable efforts
    that align well with the philosophy and the goals of the Perl project.</p>
<p class="Pp">Core Team members are expected to act as role models for the
    community and custodians of the project, on behalf of the community and all
    those who rely on Perl.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Term</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Core Team members serve until they are removed.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Removal</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Core Team Members may resign their position at any time.</p>
<p class="Pp">In exceptional circumstances, it may be necessary to remove
    someone from the Core Team against their will, such as for flagrant or
    repeated violations of a Code of Conduct. Any Core Team member may send a
    recall request to the Steering Council naming the individual to be removed.
    The Steering Council must approve or reject the recall request. If approved,
    the Steering Council will organize a Membership Change vote to ratify the
    removal.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the removed member is also on the Steering Council, then they
    are removed from the Steering Council as well.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Inactivity</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Core Team members who have stopped contributing are encouraged to
    declare themselves &quot;inactive&quot;. Inactive members do not nominate or
    vote. Inactive members may declare themselves active at any time, except
    when a vote has been proposed and is not concluded. Eligibility to nominate
    or vote will be determined by the Vote Administrator.</p>
<p class="Pp">To record and honor their contributions, inactive Core Team
    members will continue to be listed alongside active members.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>No Confidence in the Steering Council</i></p>
<p class="Pp">The Core Team may remove either a single Steering Council member
    or the entire Steering Council via a No Confidence Vote.</p>
<p class="Pp">A No Confidence Vote is triggered when a Core Team member calls
    for one publicly on an appropriate project communication channel, and
    another Core Team member seconds the proposal.</p>
<p class="Pp">If a No Confidence Vote removes all Steering Council members, the
    Vote Administrator of the No Confidence Vote will then administer an
    election to select a new Steering Council.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Amending Perl Rules of Governance</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Any Core Team member may propose amending the Perl Rules of
    Governance by sending a proposal to the Steering Council. The Steering
    Council must decide to approve or reject the proposal. If approved, the
    Steering Council will administer an Amendment Vote.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Rules for Voting</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Membership Change, Amendment, and No Confidence Votes require 2/3
    of participating votes from Core Team members to pass.</p>
<p class="Pp">A Vote Administrator must be selected following the rules in the
    &quot;Vote Administrator&quot; section.</p>
<p class="Pp">The vote occurs in two steps:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>1.</dt>
  <dd>The Vote Administrator describes the proposal being voted upon. The Core
      Team then may discuss the matter in advance of voting.</dd>
  <dt>2.</dt>
  <dd>Active Core Team members vote in favor or against the proposal. Voting is
      performed anonymously.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">For a Membership Change Vote, each phase will last one week. For
    Amendment and No Confidence Votes, each phase will last two weeks.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="The_Steering_Council"><a class="permalink" href="#The_Steering_Council">The
  Steering Council</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The Steering Council is a 3-person committee, elected by the Core
    Team. Candidates are not required to be members of the Core Team. Non-member
    candidates are added to the Core Team if elected as if by a Membership
    Change Vote.</p>
<p class="Pp">References to specific elections are explained in the &quot;Rules
    for Elections&quot; section.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Powers</i></p>
<p class="Pp">The Steering Council has broad authority to make decisions about
    the development of the Perl language, the interpreter, and all other
    components, systems and processes that result in new releases of the
    language interpreter.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, it can:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Manage the schedule and process for shipping new releases</li>
  <li>Establish procedures for proposing, discussing and deciding upon changes
      to the language</li>
  <li>Delegate power to individuals on or outside the Steering Council</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">Decisions of the Steering Council will be made by majority vote of
    non-vacant seats on the council.</p>
<p class="Pp">The Steering Council should look for ways to use these powers as
    little as possible. Instead of voting, it's better to seek consensus.
    Instead of ruling on individual cases, it's better to define standards and
    processes that apply to all cases.</p>
<p class="Pp">As with the Core Team, the Steering Council does not have any
    authority over parts of the Perl ecosystem unrelated to developing and
    releasing the language itself.</p>
<p class="Pp">The Steering Council does not have the power to modify the Perl
    Rules of Governance, except as provided in the section &quot;Amending Perl
    Rules of Governance&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Term</i></p>
<p class="Pp">A new Steering Council will be chosen by a Term Election within
    two weeks after each stable feature release (that is, change to
    <span class="Li">&quot;PERL_REVISION&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;PERL_VERSION&quot;</span>) or after two years,
    whichever comes first. The council members will serve until the completion
    of the next Term Election unless they are removed.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Removal</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Steering Council members may resign their position at any
  time.</p>
<p class="Pp">Whenever there are vacancies on the Steering Council, the council
    will organize a Special Election within one week after the vacancy occurs.
    If the entire Steering Council is ever vacant, a Term Election will be held
    instead.</p>
<p class="Pp">If a Steering Council member is deceased, or drops out of touch
    and cannot be contacted for a month or longer, then the rest of the council
    may vote to declare their seat vacant. If an absent member returns after
    such a declaration is made, they are not reinstated automatically, but may
    run in the Special Election to fill the vacancy.</p>
<p class="Pp">Otherwise, Steering Council members may only be removed before the
    end of their term through a No Confidence Vote by the Core Team.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Rules for Elections</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Term and Special Election are ranked-choice votes to construct an
    ordered list of candidates to fill vacancies in the Steering Council.</p>
<p class="Pp">A Vote Administrator must be selected following the rules in the
    &quot;Vote Administrator&quot; section.</p>
<p class="Pp">Both Term and Special Elections occur in two stages:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>1.</dt>
  <dd>Candidates advertise their interest in serving. Candidates must be
      nominated by an active Core Team member. Self-nominations are allowed.
      Nominated candidates may share a statement about their candidacy with the
      Core Team.</dd>
  <dt>2.</dt>
  <dd>Active Core Team Members vote by ranking all candidates. Voting is
      performed anonymously. After voting is complete, candidates are ranked
      using the Condorcet Internet Voting Service's proportional representation
      mode. If a tie occurs, it may be resolved by mutual agreement among the
      tied candidates, or else the tie will be resolved through random selection
      by the Vote Administrator.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Anyone voted off the Core Team is not eligible to be a candidate
    for Steering Council unless re-instated to the Core Team.</p>
<p class="Pp">For a Term Election, each phase will last two weeks. At the end of
    the second phase, the top three ranked candidates are elected as the new
    Steering Council.</p>
<p class="Pp">For a Special Election, each phase will last one week. At the end
    of the second phase, vacancies are filled from the ordered list of
    candidates until no vacancies remain.</p>
<p class="Pp">The election of the first Steering Council will be a Term
    Election. Ricardo Signes will be the Vote Administrator for the initial Term
    Election unless he is a candidate, in which case he will select a
    non-candidate administrator to replace him.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="The_Vote_Administrator"><a class="permalink" href="#The_Vote_Administrator">The
  Vote Administrator</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Every election or vote requires a Vote Administrator who manages
    communication, collection of secret ballots, and all other necessary
    activities to complete the voting process.</p>
<p class="Pp">Unless otherwise specified, the Steering Council selects the Vote
    Administrator.</p>
<p class="Pp">A Vote Administrator must not be a member of the Steering Council
    nor a candidate or subject of the vote. A Vote Administrator may be a member
    of the Core Team and, if so, may cast a vote while also serving as
    administrator. If the Vote Administrator becomes a candidate during an
    election vote, they will appoint a non-candidate replacement.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the entire Steering Council is vacant or is the subject of a No
    Confidence Vote, then the Core Team will select a Vote Administrator by
    consensus. If consensus cannot be reached within one week, the President of
    The Perl Foundation will select a Vote Administrator.</p>
