</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp"><b>curl</b> is a tool for transferring data from or to a server
    using URLs. It supports these protocols: DICT, FILE, FTP, FTPS, GOPHER,
    GOPHERS, HTTP, HTTPS, IMAP, IMAPS, LDAP, LDAPS, MQTT, POP3, POP3S, RTMP,
    RTMPS, RTSP, SCP, SFTP, SMB, SMBS, SMTP, SMTPS, TELNET, TFTP, WS and
  WSS.</p>
<p class="Pp">curl is powered by libcurl for all transfer-related features. See
    <i>libcurl(3)</i> for details.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="URL"><a class="permalink" href="#URL">URL</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The URL syntax is protocol-dependent. You find a detailed
    description in RFC 3986.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you provide a URL without a leading <b>protocol://</b> scheme,
    curl guesses what protocol you want. It then defaults to HTTP but assumes
    others based on often-used host name prefixes. For example, for host names
    starting with &quot;ftp.&quot; curl assumes you want FTP.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can specify any amount of URLs on the command line. They are
    fetched in a sequential manner in the specified order unless you use <i>-Z,
    --parallel</i>. You can specify command line options and URLs mixed and in
    any order on the command line.</p>
<p class="Pp">curl attempts to reuse connections when doing multiple transfers,
    so that getting many files from the same server do not use multiple connects
    and setup handshakes. This improves speed. Connection reuse can only be done
    for URLs specified for a single command line invocation and cannot be
    performed between separate curl runs.</p>
<p class="Pp">Provide an IPv6 zone id in the URL with an escaped percentage
    sign. Like in</p>
<pre>
&quot;http://[fe80::3%25eth0]/&quot;</pre>
<p class="Pp">Everything provided on the command line that is not a command line
    option or its argument, curl assumes is a URL and treats it as such.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="GLOBBING"><a class="permalink" href="#GLOBBING">GLOBBING</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">You can specify multiple URLs or parts of URLs by writing lists
    within braces or ranges within brackets. We call this
  &quot;globbing&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">Provide a list with three different names like this:</p>
<pre>
&quot;http://site.{one,two,three}.com&quot;</pre>
<p class="Pp">Do sequences of alphanumeric series by using [] as in:</p>
<pre>
&quot;ftp://ftp.example.com/file[1-100].txt&quot;</pre>
<p class="Pp">With leading zeroes:</p>
<pre>
&quot;ftp://ftp.example.com/file[001-100].txt&quot;</pre>
<p class="Pp">With letters through the alphabet:</p>
<pre>
&quot;ftp://ftp.example.com/file[a-z].txt&quot;</pre>
<p class="Pp">Nested sequences are not supported, but you can use several ones
    next to each other:</p>
<pre>
&quot;http://example.com/archive[1996-1999]/vol[1-4]/part{a,b,c}.html&quot;</pre>
<p class="Pp">You can specify a step counter for the ranges to get every Nth
    number or letter:</p>
<pre>
&quot;http://example.com/file[1-100:10].txt&quot;
&quot;http://example.com/file[a-z:2].txt&quot;</pre>
<p class="Pp">When using [] or {} sequences when invoked from a command line
    prompt, you probably have to put the full URL within double quotes to avoid
    the shell from interfering with it. This also goes for other characters
    treated special, like for example '&amp;', '?' and '*'.</p>
<p class="Pp">Switch off globbing with <i>-g, --globoff</i>.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="VARIABLES"><a class="permalink" href="#VARIABLES">VARIABLES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">curl supports command line variables (added in 8.3.0). Set
    variables with <i>--variable</i> name=content or <i>--variable</i> name@file
    (where &quot;file&quot; can be stdin if set to a single dash (-)).</p>
<p class="Pp">Variable contents can be expanded in option parameters using
    &quot;{{name}}&quot; (without the quotes) if the option name is prefixed
    with &quot;--expand-&quot;. This gets the contents of the variable
    &quot;name&quot; inserted, or a blank if the name does not exist as a
    variable. Insert &quot;{{&quot; verbatim in the string by prefixing it with
    a backslash, like &quot;\{{&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">You an access and expand environment variables by first importing
    them. You can select to either require the environment variable to be set or
    you can provide a default value in case it is not already set. Plain
    <i>--variable</i> %name imports the variable called 'name' but exits with an
    error if that environment variable is not already set. To provide a default
    value if it is not set, use <i>--variable</i> %name=content or
    <i>--variable</i> %name@content.</p>
<p class="Pp">Example. Get the USER environment variable into the URL, fail if
    USER is not set:</p>
<pre>
--variable '%USER'
--expand-url = &quot;https://example.com/api/{{USER}}/method&quot;</pre>
<p class="Pp">When expanding variables, curl supports a set of functions that
    can make the variable contents more convenient to use. It can trim leading
    and trailing white space with <i>trim</i>, it can output the contents as a
    JSON quoted string with <i>json</i>, URL encode the string with <i>url</i>
    or base64 encode it with <i>b64</i>. You apply function to a variable
    expansion, add them colon separated to the right side of the variable.
    Variable content holding null bytes that are not encoded when expanded cause
    error.</p>
<p class="Pp">Example: get the contents of a file called $HOME/.secret into a
    variable called &quot;fix&quot;. Make sure that the content is trimmed and
    percent-encoded sent as POST data:</p>
<pre>
--variable %HOME
--expand-variable fix@{{HOME}}/.secret
--expand-data &quot;{{fix:trim:url}}&quot;
https://example.com/</pre>
<p class="Pp">Command line variables and expansions were added in in 8.3.0.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="OUTPUT"><a class="permalink" href="#OUTPUT">OUTPUT</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">If not told otherwise, curl writes the received data to stdout. It
    can be instructed to instead save that data into a local file, using the
    <i>-o, --output</i> or <i>-O, --remote-name</i> options. If curl is given
    multiple URLs to transfer on the command line, it similarly needs multiple
    options for where to save them.</p>
<p class="Pp">curl does not parse or otherwise &quot;understand&quot; the
    content it gets or writes as output. It does no encoding or decoding, unless
    explicitly asked to with dedicated command line options.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="PROGRESS_METER"><a class="permalink" href="#PROGRESS_METER">PROGRESS
  METER</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">curl normally displays a progress meter during operations,
    indicating the amount of transferred data, transfer speeds and estimated
    time left, etc. The progress meter displays the transfer rate in bytes per
    second. The suffixes (k, M, G, T, P) are 1024 based. For example 1k is 1024
    bytes. 1M is 1048576 bytes.</p>
<p class="Pp">curl displays this data to the terminal by default, so if you
    invoke curl to do an operation and it is about to write data to the
    terminal, it <i>disables</i> the progress meter as otherwise it would mess
    up the output mixing progress meter and response data.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you want a progress meter for HTTP POST or PUT requests, you
    need to redirect the response output to a file, using shell redirect (&gt;),
    <i>-o, --output</i> or similar.</p>
<p class="Pp">This does not apply to FTP upload as that operation does not spit
    out any response data to the terminal.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you prefer a progress &quot;bar&quot; instead of the regular
    meter, <i>-#, --progress-bar</i> is your friend. You can also disable the
    progress meter completely with the <i>-s, --silent</i> option.</p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="VERSION"><a class="permalink" href="#VERSION">VERSION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">This man page describes curl %VERSION. If you use a later version,
    chances are this man page does not fully document it. If you use an earlier
    version, this document tries to include version information about which
    specific version that introduced changes.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can always learn which the latest curl version is by
  running</p>
<pre>
curl https://curl.se/info</pre>
<p class="Pp">The online version of this man page is always showing the latest
    incarnation: https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Options start with one or two dashes. Many of the options require
    an additional value next to them. If provided text does not start with a
    dash, it is presumed to be and treated as a URL.</p>
<p class="Pp">The short &quot;single-dash&quot; form of the options, -d for
    example, may be used with or without a space between it and its value,
    although a space is a recommended separator. The long
    &quot;double-dash&quot; form, <i>-d, --data</i> for example, requires a
    space between it and its value.</p>
<p class="Pp">Short version options that do not need any additional values can
    be used immediately next to each other, like for example you can specify all
    the options <i>-O</i>, <i>-L</i> and <i>-v</i> at once as <i>-OLv</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">In general, all boolean options are enabled with --<b>option</b>
    and yet again disabled with --<b>no-</b>option. That is, you use the same
    option name but prefix it with &quot;no-&quot;. However, in this list we
    mostly only list and show the <i>--option</i> version of them.</p>
<p class="Pp">When <i>-:, --next</i> is used, it resets the parser state and you
    start again with a clean option state, except for the options that are
    &quot;global&quot;. Global options retain their values and meaning even
    after <i>-:, --next</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following options are global: <i>--fail-early</i>,
    <i>--libcurl</i>, <i>--parallel-immediate</i>, <i>-Z, --parallel</i>, <i>-#,
    --progress-bar</i>, <i>--rate</i>, <i>-S, --show-error</i>, <i>--stderr</i>,
    <i>--styled-output</i>, <i>--trace-ascii</i>, <i>--trace-config</i>,
    <i>--trace-ids</i>, <i>--trace-time</i>, <i>--trace</i> and <i>-v,
    --verbose</i>.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="abstract"><a class="permalink" href="#abstract">--abstract-unix-socket
    &lt;path&gt;</a></dt>
  <dd>(HTTP) Connect through an abstract Unix domain socket, instead of using
      the network. Note: netstat shows the path of an abstract socket prefixed
      with '@', however the &lt;path&gt; argument should not have this leading
      character.
    <p class="Pp">If --abstract-unix-socket is provided several times, the last
        set value is used.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Example:</p>
    <pre>
<br/>
 curl --abstract-unix-socket socketpath https://example.com</pre>
    <p class="Pp">See also <i>--unix-socket</i>. Added in 7.53.0.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="alt"><a class="permalink" href="#alt">--alt-svc &lt;file
    name&gt;</a></dt>
  <dd>(HTTPS) This option enables the alt-svc parser in curl. If the file name
      points to an existing alt-svc cache file, that gets used. After a
      completed transfer, the cache is saved to the file name again if it has
      been modified.
    <p class="Pp">Specify a &quot;&quot; file name (zero length) to avoid
        loading/saving and make curl just handle the cache in memory.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If this option is used several times, curl loads contents from
        all the files but the last one is used for saving.</p>
    <p class="Pp">--alt-svc can be used several times in a command line</p>
    <p class="Pp">Example:</p>
    <pre>
<br/>
 curl --alt-svc svc.txt https://example.com</pre>
    <p class="Pp">See also <i>--resolve</i> and <i>--connect-to</i>. Added in
        7.64.1.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="anyauth"><a class="permalink" href="#anyauth">--anyauth</a></dt>
  <dd>(HTTP) Tells curl to figure out authentication method by itself, and use
      the most secure one the remote site claims to support. This is done by
      first doing a request and checking the response-headers, thus possibly
      inducing an extra network round-trip. This is used instead of setting a
      specific authentication method, which you can do with <i>--basic</i>,
      <i>--digest</i>, <i>--ntlm</i>, and <i>--negotiate</i>.
    <p class="Pp">Using <i>--anyauth</i> is not recommended if you do uploads
        from stdin, since it may require data to be sent twice and then the
        client must be able to rewind. If the need should arise when uploading
        from stdin, the upload operation fails.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Used together with <i>-u, --user</i>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Providing --anyauth multiple times has no extra effect.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Example:</p>
    <pre>
<br/>
 curl --anyauth --user me:pwd https://example.com</pre>
    <p class="Pp">See also <i>--proxy-anyauth</i>, <i>--basic</i> and
        <i>--digest</i>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="a,"><a class="permalink" href="#a,">-a, --append</a></dt>
  <dd>(FTP SFTP) When used in an upload, this option makes curl append to the
      target file instead of overwriting it. If the remote file does not exist,
      it is created. Note that this flag is ignored by some SFTP servers
      (including OpenSSH).
    <p class="Pp">Providing --append multiple times has no extra effect. Disable
        it again with --no-append.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Example:</p>
    <pre>
<br/>
 curl --upload-file local --append ftp://example.com/</pre>
    <p class="Pp">See also <i>-r, --range</i> and <i>-C, --continue-at</i>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="aws"><a class="permalink" href="#aws">--aws-sigv4
    &lt;provider1[:provider2[:region[:service]]]&gt;</a></dt>
  <dd>(HTTP) Use AWS V4 signature authentication in the transfer.
    <p class="Pp">The provider argument is a string that is used by the
        algorithm when creating outgoing authentication headers.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The region argument is a string that points to a geographic
        area of a resources collection (region-code) when the region name is
        omitted from the endpoint.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The service argument is a string that points to a function
        provided by a cloud (service-code) when the service name is omitted from
        the endpoint.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If --aws-sigv4 is provided several times, the last set value
        is used.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Example:</p>
    <pre>
<br/>
 curl --aws-sigv4 &quot;aws:amz:us-east-2:es&quot; --user &quot;key:secret&quot; https://example.com</pre>
    <p class="Pp">See also <i>--basic</i> and <i>-u, --user</i>. Added in
        7.75.0.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="basic"><a class="permalink" href="#basic">--basic</a></dt>
  <dd>(HTTP) Tells curl to use HTTP Basic authentication with the remote host.
      This is the default and this option is usually pointless, unless you use
      it to override a previously set option that sets a different
      authentication method (such as <i>--ntlm</i>, <i>--digest</i>, or
      <i>--negotiate</i>).
    <p class="Pp">Used together with <i>-u, --user</i>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Providing --basic multiple times has no extra effect.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Example:</p>
    <pre>
<br/>
 curl -u name:password --basic https://example.com</pre>
    <p class="Pp">See also <i>--proxy-basic</i>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="ca"><a class="permalink" href="#ca">--ca-native</a></dt>
  <dd>(TLS) Tells curl to use the CA store from the native operating system to
      verify the peer. By default, curl otherwise uses a CA store provided in a
      single file or directory, but when using this option it interfaces the
      operating system's own vault.
    <p class="Pp">This option works for curl on Windows when built to use
        OpenSSL, wolfSSL (added in 8.3.0) or GnuTLS (added in 8.5.0). When curl
        on Windows is built to use Schannel, this feature is implied and curl
        then only uses the native CA store.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Providing --ca-native multiple times has no extra effect.
        Disable it again with --no-ca-native.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Example:</p>
    <pre>
<br/>
 curl --ca-native https://example.com</pre>
    <p class="Pp">See also <i>--cacert</i>, <i>--capath</i> and <i>-k,
        --insecure</i>. Added in 8.2.0.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="cacert"><a class="permalink" href="#cacert">--cacert
    &lt;file&gt;</a></dt>
  <dd>(TLS) Tells curl to use the specified certificate file to verify the peer.
      The file may contain multiple CA certificates. The certificate(s) must be
      in PEM format. Normally curl is built to use a default file for this, so
      this option is typically used to alter that default file.
    <p class="Pp">curl recognizes the environment variable named
        'CURL_CA_BUNDLE' if it is set and the TLS backend is not Schannel, and
        uses the given path as a path to a CA cert bundle. This option overrides
        that variable.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The windows version of curl automatically looks for a CA certs
        file named 'curl-ca-bundle.crt', either in the same directory as
        curl.exe, or in the Current Working Directory, or in any folder along
        your PATH.</p>
    <p class="Pp">(iOS and macOS only) If curl is built against Secure
        Transport, then this option is supported for backward compatibility with
        other SSL engines, but it should not be set. If the option is not set,
        then curl uses the certificates in the system and user Keychain to
        verify the peer, which is the preferred method of verifying the peer's
        certificate chain.</p>
    <p class="Pp">(Schannel only) This option is supported for Schannel in
        Windows 7 or later (added in 7.60.0). This option is supported for
        backward compatibility with other SSL engines; instead it is recommended
        to use Windows' store of root certificates (the default for
      Schannel).</p>
    <p class="Pp">If --cacert is provided several times, the last set value is

  <dt id="capath"><a class="permalink" href="#capath">--capath
    &lt;dir&gt;</a></dt>
  <dd>(TLS) Tells curl to use the specified certificate directory to verify the
      peer. Multiple paths can be provided by separating them with &quot;:&quot;
      (e.g. &quot;path1:path2:path3&quot;). The certificates must be in PEM
      format, and if curl is built against OpenSSL, the directory must have been
      processed using the c_rehash utility supplied with OpenSSL. Using
      <i>--capath</i> can allow OpenSSL-powered curl to make SSL-connections
      much more efficiently than using <i>--cacert</i> if the <i>--cacert</i>
      file contains many CA certificates.
    <p class="Pp">If this option is set, the default capath value is

  <dt id="cert"><a class="permalink" href="#cert">--cert-status</a></dt>
  <dd>(TLS) Tells curl to verify the status of the server certificate by using
      the Certificate Status Request (aka. OCSP stapling) TLS extension.
    <p class="Pp">If this option is enabled and the server sends an invalid
        (e.g. expired) response, if the response suggests that the server
        certificate has been revoked, or no response at all is received, the
        verification fails.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This is currently only implemented in the OpenSSL and GnuTLS
        backends.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Providing --cert-status multiple times has no extra effect.

    <p class="Pp">The default type depends on the TLS backend and is usually
        PEM, however for Secure Transport and Schannel it is P12. If <i>-E,

  </dd>
  <dt id="E,"><a class="permalink" href="#E,">-E, --cert
    &lt;certificate[:password]&gt;</a></dt>
  <dd>(TLS) Tells curl to use the specified client certificate file when getting
      a file with HTTPS, FTPS or another SSL-based protocol. The certificate
      must be in PKCS#12 format if using Secure Transport, or PEM format if
      using any other engine. If the optional password is not specified, it is
      queried for on the terminal. Note that this option assumes a certificate
      file that is the private key and the client certificate concatenated. See
      <i>-E, --cert</i> and <i>--key</i> to specify them independently.
    <p class="Pp">In the &lt;certificate&gt; portion of the argument, you must
        escape the character &quot;:&quot; as &quot;\:&quot; so that it is not
        recognized as the password delimiter. Similarly, you must escape the
        double quote character as \&quot; so that it is not recognized as an
        escape character.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If curl is built against OpenSSL library, and the engine
        pkcs11 is available, then a PKCS#11 URI (RFC 7512) can be used to
        specify a certificate located in a PKCS#11 device. A string beginning
        with &quot;pkcs11:&quot; is interpreted as a PKCS#11 URI. If a PKCS#11
        URI is provided, then the <i>--engine</i> option is set as
        &quot;pkcs11&quot; if none was provided and the <i>--cert-type</i>
        option is set as &quot;ENG&quot; if none was provided.</p>
    <p class="Pp">(iOS and macOS only) If curl is built against Secure
        Transport, then the certificate string can either be the name of a
        certificate/private key in the system or user keychain, or the path to a
        PKCS#12-encoded certificate and private key. If you want to use a file
        from the current directory, please precede it with &quot;./&quot;
        prefix, in order to avoid confusion with a nickname.</p>
    <p class="Pp">(Schannel only) Client certificates must be specified by a
        path expression to a certificate store. (Loading <i>PFX</i> is not
        supported; you can import it to a store first). You can use
        &quot;&lt;store location&gt;\&lt;store name&gt;\&lt;thumbprint&gt;&quot;
        to refer to a certificate in the system certificates store, for example,
        <i>&quot;CurrentUser\MY\934a7ac6f8a5d579285a74fa61e19f23ddfe8d7a&quot;</i>.
        Thumbprint is usually a SHA-1 hex string which you can see in
        certificate details. Following store locations are supported:
        <i>CurrentUser</i>, <i>LocalMachine</i>, <i>CurrentService</i>,
        <i>Services</i>, <i>CurrentUserGroupPolicy</i>,
        <i>LocalMachineGroupPolicy</i> and <i>LocalMachineEnterprise</i>.</p>

  <dd>Specify a text file to read curl arguments from. The command line
      arguments found in the text file are used as if they were provided on the
      command line.
    <p class="Pp">Options and their parameters must be specified on the same
        line in the file, separated by whitespace, colon, or the equals sign.
        Long option names can optionally be given in the config file without the
        initial double dashes and if so, the colon or equals characters can be
        used as separators. If the option is specified with one or two dashes,
        there can be no colon or equals character between the option and its
        parameter.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If the parameter contains whitespace or starts with a colon
        (:) or equals sign (=), it must be specified enclosed within double
        quotes (&quot;). Within double quotes the following escape sequences are
        available: \\, \&quot;, \t, \n, \r and \v. A backslash preceding any
        other letter is ignored.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If the first non-blank column of a config line is a '#'
        character, that line is treated as a comment.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Only write one option per physical line in the config file. A
        single line is required to be no more than 10 megabytes (since
      8.2.0).</p>
    <p class="Pp">Specify the filename to <i>-K, --config</i> as '-' to make
        curl read the file from stdin.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that to be able to specify a URL in the config file, you
        need to specify it using the <i>--url</i> option, and not by simply
        writing the URL on its own line. So, it could look similar to this:</p>
    <pre>
url = &quot;https://curl.se/docs/&quot;
# --- Example file ---
# this is a comment
url = &quot;example.com&quot;
output = &quot;curlhere.html&quot;

-O
referer = &quot;http://nowhereatall.example.com/&quot;
# --- End of example file ---</pre>
    <p class="Pp">When curl is invoked, it (unless <i>-q, --disable</i> is used)
        checks for a default config file and uses it if found, even when <i>-K,
        --config</i> is used. The default config file is checked for in the

    <p class="Pp">7) Non-Windows: use getpwuid to find the home directory</p>
    <p class="Pp">8) On Windows, if it finds no <i>.curlrc</i> file in the
        sequence described above, it checks for one in the same dir the curl
        executable is placed.</p>
    <p class="Pp">On Windows two filenames are checked per location:
        <i>.curlrc</i> and <i>_curlrc</i>, preferring the former. Older versions
        on Windows checked for <i>_curlrc</i> only.</p>

      period it continues - if not it exits.
    <p class="Pp">This option accepts decimal values. The decimal value needs to
        be provided using a dot (.) as decimal separator - not the local version

      connection. It does NOT affect the hostname/port that is used for TLS/SSL
      (e.g. SNI, certificate verification) or for the application protocols.
      &quot;HOST1&quot; and &quot;PORT1&quot; may be the empty string, meaning
      &quot;any host/port&quot;. &quot;HOST2&quot; and &quot;PORT2&quot; may

  <dd>(HTTP) Specify to which file you want curl to write all cookies after a
      completed operation. Curl writes all cookies from its in-memory cookie
      storage to the given file at the end of operations. If no cookies are
      known, no data is written. The file is created using the Netscape cookie
      file format. If you set the file name to a single dash, &quot;-&quot;, the
      cookies are written to stdout.
    <p class="Pp">The file specified with <i>-c, --cookie-jar</i> is only used
        for output. No cookies are read from the file. To read cookies, use the
        <i>-b, --cookie</i> option. Both options can specify the same file.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This command line option activates the cookie engine that
        makes curl record and use cookies. The <i>-b, --cookie</i> option also
        activates it.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If the cookie jar cannot be created or written to, the whole
        curl operation does not fail or even report an error clearly. Using
        <i>-v, --verbose</i> gets a warning displayed, but that is the only
        visible feedback you get about this possibly lethal situation.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If --cookie-jar is provided several times, the last set value
        is used.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Examples:</p>
    <pre>

  </dd>
  <dt id="b,"><a class="permalink" href="#b,">-b, --cookie
    &lt;data|filename&gt;</a></dt>
  <dd>(HTTP) Pass the data to the HTTP server in the Cookie header. It is
      supposedly the data previously received from the server in a
      &quot;Set-Cookie:&quot; line. The data should be in the format
      &quot;NAME1=VALUE1; NAME2=VALUE2&quot;. This makes curl use the cookie
      header with this content explicitly in all outgoing request(s). If
      multiple requests are done due to authentication, followed redirects or
      similar, they all get this cookie passed on.
    <p class="Pp">If no '=' symbol is used in the argument, it is instead
        treated as a filename to read previously stored cookie from. This option
        also activates the cookie engine which makes curl record incoming
        cookies, which may be handy if you are using this in combination with
        the <i>-L, --location</i> option or do multiple URL transfers on the
        same invoke.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If the file name is exactly a minus (&quot;-&quot;), curl
        instead reads the contents from stdin. If the file name is an empty
        string (&quot;&quot;) and is the only cookie input, curl will activate
        the cookie engine without any cookies.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The file format of the file to read cookies from should be
        plain HTTP headers (Set-Cookie style) or the Netscape/Mozilla cookie
        file format.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The file specified with <i>-b, --cookie</i> is only used as
        input. No cookies are written to the file. To store cookies, use the
        <i>-c, --cookie-jar</i> option.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you use the Set-Cookie file format and do not specify a
        domain then the cookie is not sent since the domain never matches. To
        address this, set a domain in Set-Cookie line (doing that includes
        subdomains) or preferably: use the Netscape format.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Users often want to both read cookies from a file and write
        updated cookies back to a file, so using both <i>-b, --cookie</i> and
        <i>-c, --cookie-jar</i> in the same command line is common.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If curl is built with PSL (<b>Public Suffix List</b>) support,
        it detects and discards cookies that are specified for such suffix
        domains that should not be allowed to have cookies. If curl is
        <i>not</i> built with PSL support, it has no ability to stop super
        cookies.</p>
    <p class="Pp">--cookie can be used several times in a command line</p>

  <dd>(TLS) Tells curl to request specific curves to use during SSL session

      provided by separating them with &quot;:&quot; (e.g.
      &quot;X25519:P-521&quot;). The parameter is available identically in the
      OpenSSL &quot;s_client&quot; and &quot;s_server&quot; utilities.
    <p class="Pp"><i>--curves</i> allows a OpenSSL powered curl to make
        SSL-connections with exactly the (EC) curve requested by the client,
        avoiding nontransparent client/server negotiations.</p>

  <dd>(HTTP) This posts data exactly as specified with no extra processing

    <p class="Pp">If you start the data with the letter @, the rest should be a

        except that newlines and carriage returns are preserved and conversions
        are never done.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Like <i>-d, --data</i> the default content-type sent to the

  <dd>(HTTP) This posts data, similar to the other <i>-d, --data</i> options
      with the exception that this performs URL-encoding.
    <p class="Pp">To be CGI-compliant, the &lt;data&gt; part should begin with a
        <i>name</i> followed by a separator and a content specification. The
        &lt;data&gt; part can be passed to curl using one of the following
        syntaxes:</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="content"><a class="permalink" href="#content">content</a></dt>
  <dd>This makes curl URL-encode the content and pass that on. Just be careful
      so that the content does not contain any = or @ symbols, as that makes the
      syntax match one of the other cases below!</dd>
  <dt>=content</dt>
  <dd>This makes curl URL-encode the content and pass that on. The preceding =
      symbol is not included in the data.</dd>
  <dt id="name=content"><a class="permalink" href="#name=content">name=content</a></dt>
  <dd>This makes curl URL-encode the content part and pass that on. Note that
      the name part is expected to be URL-encoded already.</dd>
  <dt>@filename</dt>
  <dd>This makes curl load data from the given file (including any newlines),
      URL-encode that data and pass it on in the POST.</dd>
  <dt id="name@filename"><a class="permalink" href="#name@filename">name@filename</a></dt>
  <dd>This makes curl load data from the given file (including any newlines),
      URL-encode that data and pass it on in the POST. The name part gets an
      equal sign appended, resulting in <i>name=urlencoded-file-content</i>.
      Note that the name is expected to be URL-encoded already.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>
    <p class="Pp">--data-urlencode can be used several times in a command
      line</p>

<br/>

  </dd>
  <dt id="d,"><a class="permalink" href="#d,">-d, --data &lt;data&gt;</a></dt>
  <dd>(HTTP MQTT) Sends the specified data in a POST request to the HTTP server,
      in the same way that a browser does when a user has filled in an HTML form
      and presses the submit button. This makes curl pass the data to the server
      using the content-type application/x-www-form-urlencoded. Compare to
      <i>-F, --form</i>.
    <p class="Pp"><i>--data-raw</i> is almost the same but does not have a
        special interpretation of the @ character. To post data purely binary,
        you should instead use the <i>--data-binary</i> option. To URL-encode
        the value of a form field you may use <i>--data-urlencode</i>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If any of these options is used more than once on the same
        command line, the data pieces specified are merged with a separating
        &amp;-symbol. Thus, using '-d name=daniel -d skill=lousy' would generate
        a post chunk that looks like 'name=daniel&amp;skill=lousy'.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you start the data with the letter @, the rest should be a
        file name to read the data from, or - if you want curl to read the data
        from stdin. Posting data from a file named 'foobar' would thus be done
        with <i>-d, --data</i> @foobar. When <i>-d, --data</i> is told to read
        from a file like that, carriage returns and newlines are stripped out.
        If you do not want the @ character to have a special interpretation use
        <i>--data-raw</i> instead.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The data for this option is passed on to the server exactly as
        provided on the command line. curl does not convert, change or improve
        it. It is up to the user to provide the data in the correct form.</p>
    <p class="Pp">--data can be used several times in a command line</p>
    <p class="Pp">Examples:</p>
    <pre>

      an extension to the original FTP protocol, and does not work on all
      servers, but enables more functionality in a better way than the
      traditional PORT command.

  <dd>(HTTP) Maximum time in seconds that you allow curl to wait for a
      100-continue response when curl emits an Expects: 100-continue header in
      its request. By default curl waits one second. This option accepts decimal
      values! When curl stops waiting, it continues as if the response has been
      received.
    <p class="Pp">The decimal value needs to provided using a dot (.) as decimal
        separator - not the local version even if it might be using another
        separator.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If --expect100-timeout is provided several times, the last set

  <dt id="fail"><a class="permalink" href="#fail">--fail-early</a></dt>
  <dd>Fail and exit on the first detected transfer error.
    <p class="Pp">When curl is used to do multiple transfers on the command
        line, it attempts to operate on each given URL, one by one. By default,
        it ignores errors if there are more URLs given and the last URL's
        success determines the error code curl returns. So early failures are
        &quot;hidden&quot; by subsequent successful transfers.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Using this option, curl instead returns an error on the first
        transfer that fails, independent of the amount of URLs that are given on
        the command line. This way, no transfer failures go undetected by
        scripts and similar.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This option does not imply <i>-f, --fail</i>, which causes
        transfers to fail due to the server's HTTP status code. You can combine
        the two options, however note <i>-f, --fail</i> is not global and is
        therefore contained by <i>-:, --next</i>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This option is global and does not need to be specified for
        each use of --next.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Providing --fail-early multiple times has no extra effect.
        Disable it again with --no-fail-early.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Example:</p>
    <pre>
<br/>
 curl --fail-early https://example.com https://two.example</pre>

  <dd>(HTTP) Return an error on server errors where the HTTP response code is
      400 or greater). In normal cases when an HTTP server fails to deliver a
      document, it returns an HTML document stating so (which often also
      describes why and more). This flag allows curl to output and save that
      content but also to return error 22.
    <p class="Pp">This is an alternative option to <i>-f, --fail</i> which makes
        curl fail for the same circumstances but without saving the content.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Providing --fail-with-body multiple times has no extra effect.
        Disable it again with --no-fail-with-body.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Example:</p>

<br/>

  </dd>
  <dt id="f,"><a class="permalink" href="#f,">-f, --fail</a></dt>
  <dd>(HTTP) Fail fast with no output at all on server errors. This is useful to
      enable scripts and users to better deal with failed attempts. In normal
      cases when an HTTP server fails to deliver a document, it returns an HTML
      document stating so (which often also describes why and more). This flag
      prevents curl from outputting that and return error 22.
    <p class="Pp">This method is not fail-safe and there are occasions where
        non-successful response codes slip through, especially when
        authentication is involved (response codes 401 and 407).</p>
    <p class="Pp">Providing --fail multiple times has no extra effect. Disable

  </dd>
  <dt id="false"><a class="permalink" href="#false">--false-start</a></dt>
  <dd>(TLS) Tells curl to use false start during the TLS handshake. False start
      is a mode where a TLS client starts sending application data before
      verifying the server's Finished message, thus saving a round trip when
      performing a full handshake.
    <p class="Pp">This is currently only implemented in the Secure Transport (on
        iOS 7.0 or later, or OS X 10.9 or later) backend.</p>

  <dt id="form"><a class="permalink" href="#form">--form-escape</a></dt>
  <dd>(HTTP) Tells curl to pass on names of multipart form fields and files
      using backslash-escaping instead of percent-encoding.
    <p class="Pp">If --form-escape is provided several times, the last set value
        is used.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Example:</p>
    <pre>
<br/>
 curl --form-escape -F 'field\name=curl' -F 'file=@load&quot;this' https://example.com</pre>
    <p class="Pp">See also <i>-F, --form</i>. Added in 7.81.0.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="form~2"><a class="permalink" href="#form~2">--form-string
    &lt;name=string&gt;</a></dt>
  <dd>(HTTP SMTP IMAP) Similar to <i>-F, --form</i> except that the value string
      for the named parameter is used literally. Leading '@' and '&lt;'
      characters, and the ';type=' string in the value have no special meaning.
      Use this in preference to <i>-F, --form</i> if there is any possibility
      that the string value may accidentally trigger the '@' or '&lt;' features
      of <i>-F, --form</i>.
    <p class="Pp">--form-string can be used several times in a command line</p>
    <p class="Pp">Example:</p>
    <pre>
<br/>
 curl --form-string &quot;data&quot; https://example.com</pre>
    <p class="Pp">See also <i>-F, --form</i>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="F,"><a class="permalink" href="#F,">-F, --form
    &lt;name=content&gt;</a></dt>
  <dd>(HTTP SMTP IMAP) For HTTP protocol family, this lets curl emulate a
      filled-in form in which a user has pressed the submit button. This causes
      curl to POST data using the Content-Type multipart/form-data according to
      RFC 2388.
    <p class="Pp">For SMTP and IMAP protocols, this is the means to compose a
        multipart mail message to transmit.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This enables uploading of binary files etc. To force the
        'content' part to be a file, prefix the file name with an @ sign. To
        just get the content part from a file, prefix the file name with the
        symbol &lt;. The difference between @ and &lt; is then that @ makes a
        file get attached in the post as a file upload, while the &lt; makes a
        text field and just get the contents for that text field from a
      file.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Tell curl to read content from stdin instead of a file by
        using - as filename. This goes for both @ and &lt; constructs. When
        stdin is used, the contents is buffered in memory first by curl to
        determine its size and allow a possible resend. Defining a part's data
        from a named non-regular file (such as a named pipe or similar) is not
        subject to buffering and is instead read at transmission time; since the
        full size is unknown before the transfer starts, such data is sent as
        chunks by HTTP and rejected by IMAP.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Example: send an image to an HTTP server, where 'profile' is
        the name of the form-field to which the file <b>portrait.jpg</b> is the
        input:</p>
    <pre>
curl -F profile=@portrait.jpg https://example.com/upload.cgi</pre>
    <p class="Pp">Example: send your name and shoe size in two text fields to
        the server:</p>
    <pre>
curl -F name=John -F shoesize=11 https://example.com/</pre>
    <p class="Pp">Example: send your essay in a text field to the server. Send
        it as a plain text field, but get the contents for it from a local
      file:</p>
    <pre>
curl -F &quot;story=&lt;hugefile.txt&quot; https://example.com/</pre>
    <p class="Pp">You can also tell curl what Content-Type to use by using
        'type=', in a manner similar to:</p>
    <pre>
curl -F &quot;web=@index.html;type=text/html&quot; example.com</pre>
    <p class="Pp">or</p>
    <pre>
curl -F &quot;name=daniel;type=text/foo&quot; example.com</pre>
    <p class="Pp">You can also explicitly change the name field of a file upload
        part by setting filename=, like this:</p>
    <pre>
curl -F &quot;file=@localfile;filename=nameinpost&quot; example.com</pre>
    <p class="Pp">If filename/path contains ',' or ';', it must be quoted by
        double-quotes like:</p>
    <pre>
curl -F &quot;file=@\&quot;local,file\&quot;;filename=\&quot;name;in;post\&quot;&quot; example.com</pre>
    <p class="Pp">or</p>
    <pre>
curl -F 'file=@&quot;local,file&quot;;filename=&quot;name;in;post&quot;' example.com</pre>
    <p class="Pp">Note that if a filename/path is quoted by double-quotes, any
        double-quote or backslash within the filename must be escaped by
        backslash.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Quoting must also be applied to non-file data if it contains
        semicolons, leading/trailing spaces or leading double quotes:</p>
    <pre>
curl -F 'colors=&quot;red; green; blue&quot;;type=text/x-myapp' example.com</pre>
    <p class="Pp">You can add custom headers to the field by setting headers=,
        like</p>
    <pre>
curl -F &quot;submit=OK;headers=\&quot;X-submit-type: OK\&quot;&quot; example.com</pre>
    <p class="Pp">or</p>
    <pre>
curl -F &quot;submit=OK;headers=@headerfile&quot; example.com</pre>
    <p class="Pp">The headers= keyword may appear more that once and above notes
        about quoting apply. When headers are read from a file, Empty lines and
        lines starting with '#' are comments and ignored; each header can be
        folded by splitting between two words and starting the continuation line
        with a space; embedded carriage-returns and trailing spaces are
        stripped. Here is an example of a header file contents:</p>
    <pre>
# This file contain two headers.
X-header-1: this is a header
# The following header is folded.
X-header-2: this is
<br/>
 another header</pre>
    <p class="Pp">To support sending multipart mail messages, the syntax is
        extended as follows:</p>
    <p class="Pp">- name can be omitted: the equal sign is the first character
        of the argument,</p>
    <p class="Pp">- if data starts with '(', this signals to start a new
        multipart: it can be followed by a content type specification.</p>
    <p class="Pp">- a multipart can be terminated with a '=)' argument.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Example: the following command sends an SMTP mime email
        consisting in an inline part in two alternative formats: plain text and
        HTML. It attaches a text file:</p>
    <pre>
curl -F '=(;type=multipart/alternative' \
<br/>
     -F '=plain text message' \
<br/>
     -F '= &lt;body&gt;HTML message&lt;/body&gt;;type=text/html' \
<br/>
     -F '=)' -F '=@textfile.txt' ...  smtp://example.com</pre>
    <p class="Pp">Data can be encoded for transfer using encoder=. Available
        encodings are <i>binary</i> and <i>8bit</i> that do nothing else than
        adding the corresponding Content-Transfer-Encoding header, <i>7bit</i>
        that only rejects 8-bit characters with a transfer error,
        <i>quoted-printable</i> and <i>base64</i> that encodes data according to
        the corresponding schemes, limiting lines length to 76 characters.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Example: send multipart mail with a quoted-printable text
        message and a base64 attached file:</p>
    <pre>
curl -F '=text message;encoder=quoted-printable' \

      specified number of milliseconds. If the IPv6 address cannot be connected
      to within that time, then a connection attempt is made to the IPv4 address
      in parallel. The first connection to be established is the one that is

    <p class="Pp">The range of suggested useful values is limited. Happy
        Eyeballs RFC 6555 says &quot;It is RECOMMENDED that connection attempts

  <dd>(HTTP IMAP SMTP) Extra header to include in information sent. When used

    <p class="Pp">For an IMAP or SMTP MIME uploaded mail built with <i>-F,
        --form</i> options, it is prepended to the resulting MIME document,
        effectively including it at the mail global level. It does not affect
        raw uploaded mails (Added in 7.56.0).</p>
    <p class="Pp">You may specify any number of extra headers. Note that if you
        should add a custom header that has the same name as one of the internal
        ones curl would use, your externally set header is used instead of the
        internal one. This allows you to make even trickier stuff than curl
        would normally do. You should not replace internally set headers without
        knowing perfectly well what you are doing. Remove an internal header by
        giving a replacement without content on the right side of the colon, as
        in: -H &quot;Host:&quot;. If you send the custom header with no-value
        then its header must be terminated with a semicolon, such as \-H
        &quot;X-Custom-Header;&quot; to send &quot;X-Custom-Header:&quot;.</p>
    <p class="Pp">curl makes sure that each header you add/replace is sent with
        the proper end-of-line marker, you should thus <b>not</b> add that as a
        part of the header content: do not add newlines or carriage returns,
        they only mess things up for you. curl passes on the verbatim string you
        give it without any filter or other safe guards. That includes white
        space and control characters.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This option can take an argument in @filename style, which
        then adds a header for each line in the input file. Using @- makes curl
        read the header file from stdin. Added in 7.55.0.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Please note that most anti-spam utilities check the presence
        and value of several MIME mail headers: these are &quot;From:&quot;,
        &quot;To:&quot;, &quot;Date:&quot; and &quot;Subject:&quot; among others
        and should be added with this option.</p>
    <p class="Pp">You need <i>--proxy-header</i> to send custom headers intended
        for an HTTP proxy. Added in 7.37.0.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Passing on a &quot;Transfer-Encoding: chunked&quot; header
        when doing an HTTP request with a request body, makes curl send the data
        using chunked encoding.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><b>WARNING</b>: headers set with this option are set in all
        HTTP requests - even after redirects are followed, like when told with
        <i>-L, --location</i>. This can lead to the header being sent to other

  <dd>(TLS SFTP SCP) By default, every secure connection curl makes is verified
      to be secure before the transfer takes place. This option makes curl skip
      the verification step and proceed without checking.
    <p class="Pp">When this option is not used for protocols using TLS, curl
        verifies the server's TLS certificate before it continues: that the
        certificate contains the right name which matches the host name used in
        the URL and that the certificate has been signed by a CA certificate
        present in the cert store. See this online resource for further details:
        <b>https://curl.se/docs/sslcerts.html</b></p>
    <p class="Pp">For SFTP and SCP, this option makes curl skip the
        <i>known_hosts</i> verification. <i>known_hosts</i> is a file normally
        stored in the user's home directory in the &quot;.ssh&quot;
        subdirectory, which contains host names and their public keys.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><b>WARNING</b>: using this option makes the transfer
      insecure.</p>
    <p class="Pp">When curl uses secure protocols it trusts responses and allows
        for example HSTS and Alt-Svc information to be stored and used
        subsequently. Using <i>-k, --insecure</i> can make curl trust and use
        such information from malicious servers.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Providing --insecure multiple times has no extra effect.
        Disable it again with --no-insecure.</p>

      exists.
    <p class="Pp">If you run a local IPFS node, this gateway is by default

        potentially be a malicious actor returning you data that does not match
        the request you made, inspect or even interfere with the request. You
        will not notice this when using curl. A mitigation could be to go for a

  <dt>--json &lt;data&gt;</dt>
  <dd>(HTTP) Sends the specified JSON data in a POST request to the HTTP server.
      <i>--json</i> works as a shortcut for passing on these three options:
    <pre>
--data [arg]
--header &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot;
--header &quot;Accept: application/json&quot;</pre>
    <p class="Pp">There is <b>no verification</b> that the passed in data is
        actual JSON or that the syntax is correct.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you start the data with the letter @, the rest should be a
        file name to read the data from, or a single dash (-) if you want curl
        to read the data from stdin. Posting data from a file named 'foobar'
        would thus be done with <i>--json</i> @foobar and to instead read the
        data from stdin, use <i>--json</i> @-.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If this option is used more than once on the same command
        line, the additional data pieces are concatenated to the previous before
        sending.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The headers this option sets can be overridden with <i>-H,

    --junk-session-cookies</a></dt>
  <dd>(HTTP) When curl is told to read cookies from a given file, this option
      makes it discard all &quot;session cookies&quot;. This has the same effect
      as if a new session is started. Typical browsers discard session cookies
      when they are closed down.
    <p class="Pp">Providing --junk-session-cookies multiple times has no extra

  <dd>This option sets the time a connection needs to remain idle before sending

      currently effective on operating systems offering the
      &quot;TCP_KEEPIDLE&quot; and &quot;TCP_KEEPINTVL&quot; socket options
      (meaning Linux, recent AIX, HP-UX and more). Keepalive is used by the TCP
      stack to detect broken networks on idle connections. The number of missed
      keepalive probes before declaring the connection down is OS dependent and
      is commonly 9 or 10. This option has no effect if <i>--no-keepalive</i> is
      used.
    <p class="Pp">If unspecified, the option defaults to 60 seconds.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If --keepalive-time is provided several times, the last set

  <dd>(TLS) Private key file type. Specify which type your <i>--key</i> provided
      private key is. DER, PEM, and ENG are supported. If not specified, PEM is
      assumed.
    <p class="Pp">If --key-type is provided several times, the last set value is

  <dd>(TLS SSH) Private key file name. Allows you to provide your private key in
      this separate file. For SSH, if not specified, curl tries the following
      candidates in order: &quot;~/.ssh/id_rsa&quot;, &quot;~/.ssh/id_dsa&quot;,
      &quot;./id_rsa&quot;, &quot;./id_dsa&quot;.
    <p class="Pp">If curl is built against OpenSSL library, and the engine
        pkcs11 is available, then a PKCS#11 URI (RFC 7512) can be used to
        specify a private key located in a PKCS#11 device. A string beginning
        with &quot;pkcs11:&quot; is interpreted as a PKCS#11 URI. If a PKCS#11
        URI is provided, then the <i>--engine</i> option is set as
        &quot;pkcs11&quot; if none was provided and the <i>--key-type</i> option
        is set as &quot;ENG&quot; if none was provided.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If curl is built against Secure Transport or Schannel then
        this option is ignored for TLS protocols (HTTPS, etc). Those backends
        expect the private key to be already present in the keychain or PKCS#12
        file containing the certificate.</p>

      it slower than it otherwise would be.
    <p class="Pp">The given speed is measured in bytes/second, unless a suffix
        is appended. Appending 'k' or 'K' counts the number as kilobytes, 'm' or
        'M' makes it megabytes, while 'g' or 'G' makes it gigabytes. The
        suffixes (k, M, G, T, P) are 1024 based. For example 1k is 1024.
        Examples: 200K, 3m and 1G.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The rate limiting logic works on averaging the transfer speed
        to no more than the set threshold over a period of multiple seconds.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you also use the <i>-Y, --speed-limit</i> option, that

      machine-parse the contents of an FTP directory since the normal directory
      view does not use a standard look or format. When used like this, the
      option causes an NLST command to be sent to the server instead of LIST.
    <p class="Pp">Note: Some FTP servers list only files in their response to
        NLST; they do not include sub-directories and symbolic links.</p>
    <p class="Pp">(SFTP) When listing an SFTP directory, this switch forces a
        name-only view, one per line. This is especially useful if the user
        wants to machine-parse the contents of an SFTP directory since the
        normal directory view provides more information than just file
      names.</p>
    <p class="Pp">(POP3) When retrieving a specific email from POP3, this switch
        forces a LIST command to be performed instead of RETR. This is
        particularly useful if the user wants to see if a specific message-id
        exists on the server and what size it is.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note: When combined with <i>-X, --request</i>, this option can
        be used to send a UIDL command instead, so the user may use the email's
        unique identifier rather than its message-id to make the request.</p>

  <dd>(HTTP) If the server reports that the requested page has moved to a

      code), this option makes curl redo the request on the new place. If used
      together with <i>-i, --include</i> or <i>-I, --head</i>, headers from all
      requested pages are shown.
    <p class="Pp">When authentication is used, curl only sends its credentials
        to the initial host. If a redirect takes curl to a different host, it
        does not get the user+password pass on. See also
        <i>--location-trusted</i> on how to change this.</p>

        sends the following request with a GET if the HTTP response was 301,
        302, or 303. If the response code was any other 3xx code, curl resends
        the following request using the same unmodified method.</p>
    <p class="Pp">You can tell curl to not change POST requests to GET after a
        30x response by using the dedicated options for that: <i>--post301</i>,
        <i>--post302</i> and <i>--post303</i>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The method set with <i>-X, --request</i> overrides the method
        curl would otherwise select to use.</p>

  <dd>Makes curl scan the <i>.netrc</i> file in the user's home directory for
      login name and password. This is typically used for FTP on Unix. If used
      with HTTP, curl enables user authentication. See <i>netrc(5)</i> and
      <i>ftp(1)</i> for details on the file format. Curl does not complain if
      that file does not have the right permissions (it should be neither world-
      nor group-readable). The environment variable &quot;HOME&quot; is used to
      find the home directory.
    <p class="Pp">On Windows two filenames in the home directory are checked:
        <i>.netrc</i> and <i>_netrc</i>, preferring the former. Older versions
        on Windows checked for <i>_netrc</i> only.</p>
    <p class="Pp">A quick and simple example of how to setup a <i>.netrc</i> to
        allow curl to FTP to the machine host.domain.com with user name 'myself'
        and password 'secret' could look similar to:</p>
    <pre>

Providing --netrc multiple times has no extra effect.

  </dd>
  <dt>-:, --next</dt>
  <dd>Tells curl to use a separate operation for the following URL and
      associated options. This allows you to send several URL requests, each
      with their own specific options, for example, such as different user names
      or custom requests for each.
    <p class="Pp"><i>-:, --next</i> resets all local options and only global
        ones have their values survive over to the operation following the
        <i>-:, --next</i> instruction. Global options include <i>-v,
        --verbose</i>, <i>--trace</i>, <i>--trace-ascii</i> and
        <i>--fail-early</i>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">For example, you can do both a GET and a POST in a single

  <dt id="N,"><a class="permalink" href="#N,">-N, --no-buffer</a></dt>
  <dd>Disables the buffering of the output stream. In normal work situations,

  <dd>Use the specified proxy.
    <p class="Pp">The proxy string can be specified with a protocol:// prefix.
        No protocol specified or http:// it is treated as an HTTP proxy. Use
        socks4://, socks4a://, socks5:// or socks5h:// to request a specific
        SOCKS version to be used.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Unix domain sockets are supported for socks proxy. Set
        localhost for the host part. e.g.
        socks5h://localhost/path/to/socket.sock</p>
    <p class="Pp">HTTPS proxy support works set with the https:// protocol
        prefix for OpenSSL and GnuTLS (added in 7.52.0). It also works for
        BearSSL, mbedTLS, rustls, Schannel, Secure Transport and wolfSSL (added
        in 7.87.0).</p>
    <p class="Pp">Unrecognized and unsupported proxy protocols cause an error
        (added in 7.52.0). Ancient curl versions ignored unknown schemes and
        used http:// instead.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If the port number is not specified in the proxy string, it is
        assumed to be 1080.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This option overrides existing environment variables that set
        the proxy to use. If there is an environment variable setting a proxy,
        you can set proxy to &quot;&quot; to override it.</p>
    <p class="Pp">All operations that are performed over an HTTP proxy are
        transparently converted to HTTP. It means that certain protocol specific
        operations might not be available. This is not the case if you can
        tunnel through the proxy, as one with the <i>-p, --proxytunnel</i>
        option.</p>
    <p class="Pp">User and password that might be provided in the proxy string
        are URL decoded by curl. This allows you to pass in special characters
        such as @ by using %40 or pass in a colon with %3a.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The proxy host can be specified the same way as the proxy
        environment variables, including the protocol prefix (http://) and the
        embedded user + password.</p>
    <p class="Pp">When a proxy is used, the active FTP mode as set with <i>-P,
        --ftp-port</i>, cannot be used.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If --proxy is provided several times, the last set value is

    <p class="Pp">The only difference between this and the HTTP proxy option
        <i>-x, --proxy</i>, is that attempts to use CONNECT through the proxy
        specifies an HTTP 1.0 protocol instead of the default HTTP 1.1.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Providing --proxy1.0 multiple times has no extra effect.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Example:</p>
    <pre>
<br/>
 curl --proxy1.0 -x http://proxy https://example.com</pre>

  <dd>When an HTTP proxy is used <i>-x, --proxy</i>, this option makes curl
      tunnel the traffic through the proxy. The tunnel approach is made with the
      HTTP proxy CONNECT request and requires that the proxy allows direct

      '-'.
    <p class="Pp">(FTP only) To make commands be sent after curl has changed the
        working directory, just before the file transfer command(s), prefix the

        performed.</p>
    <p class="Pp">You may specify any number of commands.</p>
    <p class="Pp">By default curl stops at first failure. To make curl continue
        even if the command fails, prefix the command with an asterisk (*).
        Otherwise, if the server returns failure for one of the commands, the
        entire operation is aborted.</p>
    <p class="Pp">You must send syntactically correct FTP commands as RFC 959
        defines to FTP servers, or one of the commands listed below to SFTP
        servers.</p>
    <p class="Pp">SFTP is a binary protocol. Unlike for FTP, curl interprets
        SFTP quote commands itself before sending them to the server. File names

    <p class="Pp">Many HTTP/1.1 servers do not have this feature enabled, so

    <p class="Pp">If given several URLs and a transfer completes faster than the
        allowed rate, curl waits until the next transfer is started to maintain
        the requested rate. This option has no effect when <i>-Z, --parallel</i>
        is used.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The request rate is provided as &quot;N/U&quot; where N is an
        integer number and U is a time unit. Supported units are 's' (second),
        'm' (minute), 'h' (hour) and 'd' /(day, as in a 24 hour unit). The
        default time unit, if no &quot;/U&quot; is provided, is number of

        start the next request until 6 seconds have elapsed since the previous
        transfer was started.</p>

        current working directory before invoking curl with this option or use
        <i>--output-dir</i>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The remote file name to use for saving is extracted from the
        given URL, nothing else, and if it already exists it is overwritten. If
        you want the server to be able to choose the file name refer to <i>-J,
        --remote-header-name</i> which can be used in addition to this option.
        If the server chooses a file name and that name already exists it is not
        overwritten.</p>
    <p class="Pp">There is no URL decoding done on the file name. If it has %20

      name.</p>
    <p class="Pp">You may use this option as many times as the number of URLs

  <dd>Specifies a custom request method to use when communicating with the HTTP
      server. The specified request method is used instead of the method
      otherwise used (which defaults to <i>GET</i>). Read the HTTP 1.1
      specification for details and explanations. Common additional HTTP
      requests include <i>PUT</i> and <i>DELETE</i>, while related technologies
      like WebDAV offers <i>PROPFIND</i>, <i>COPY</i>, <i>MOVE</i> and more.
    <p class="Pp">Normally you do not need this option. All sorts of <i>GET</i>,
        <i>HEAD</i>, <i>POST</i> and <i>PUT</i> requests are rather invoked by
        using dedicated command line options.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This option only changes the actual word used in the HTTP

        need to use the <i>-I, --head</i> option.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The method string you set with <i>-X, --request</i> is used
        for all requests, which if you for example use <i>-L, --location</i> may

  <dd>Provide a custom address for a specific host and port pair. Using this,

      otherwise normally resolved address to be used. Consider it a sort of
      /etc/hosts alternative provided on the command line. The port number
      should be the number used for the specific protocol the host is used for.
      It means you need several entries if you want to provide address for the
      same host but different ports.
    <p class="Pp">By specifying '*' as host you can tell curl to resolve any
        host and specific port pair to the specified address. Wildcard is
        resolved last so any <i>--resolve</i> with a specific host and port is
        used first.</p>

        --ipv4</i> or <i>-6, --ipv6</i> is set to make curl use another IP
        version.</p>
    <p class="Pp">By prefixing the host with a '+' you can make the entry time
        out after curl's default timeout (1 minute). Note that this only makes
        sense for long running parallel transfers with a lot of files. In such
        cases, if this option is used curl tries to resolve the host as it
        normally would once the timeout has expired.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Support for providing the IP address within [brackets] was

        not use this option by default (for example in your <b>curlrc</b>),
        there may be unintended consequences such as sending or receiving
        duplicate data. Do not use with redirected input or output. You'd be
        much better off handling your unique problems in shell script. Please
        read the example below.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><b>WARNING</b>: For server compatibility curl attempts to
        retry failed flaky transfers as close as possible to how they were
        started, but this is not possible with redirected input or output. For
        example, before retrying it removes output data from a failed partial
        transfer that was written to an output file. However this is not true of
        data redirected to a | pipe or &gt; file, which are not reset. We
        strongly suggest you do not parse or record output via redirect in
        combination with this option, since you may receive duplicate data.</p>
    <p class="Pp">By default curl does not return error for transfers with an
        HTTP response code that indicates an HTTP error, if the transfer was
        successful. For example, if a server replies 404 Not Found and the reply
        is fully received then that is not an error. When <i>--retry</i> is used
        then curl retries on some HTTP response codes that indicate transient
        HTTP errors, but that does not include most 4xx response codes such as
        404. If you want to retry on all response codes that indicate HTTP
        errors (4xx and 5xx) then combine with <i>-f, --fail</i>.</p>

      request is made and while performing, it may take longer than this given
      time period. To limit a single request's maximum time, use <i>-m,

  <dd>If a transient error is returned when curl tries to perform a transfer, it

      either: a timeout, an FTP 4xx response code or an HTTP 408, 429, 500, 502,
      503 or 504 response code.
    <p class="Pp">When curl is about to retry a transfer, it first waits one
        second and then for all forthcoming retries it doubles the waiting time
        until it reaches 10 minutes which then remains delay between the rest of
        the retries. By using <i>--retry-delay</i> you disable this exponential

  <dd>This transfers the specified local file to the remote URL.
    <p class="Pp">If there is no file part in the specified URL, curl appends
        the local file name to the end of the URL before the operation starts.
        You must use a trailing slash (/) on the last directory to prove to curl
        that there is no file name or curl thinks that your last directory name
        is the remote file name to use.</p>
    <p class="Pp">When putting the local file name at the end of the URL, curl
        ignores what is on the left side of any slash (/) or backslash (\) used
        in the file name and only appends what is on the right side of the
        rightmost such character.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Use the file name &quot;-&quot; (a single dash) to use stdin
        instead of a given file. Alternately, the file name &quot;.&quot; (a
        single period) may be specified instead of &quot;-&quot; to use stdin in

        the <i>-T, --upload-file</i> argument, meaning that you can upload
        multiple files to a single URL by using the same URL globbing style
        supported in the URL.</p>
    <p class="Pp">When uploading to an SMTP server: the uploaded data is assumed
        to be RFC 5322 formatted. It has to feature the necessary set of headers

    <p class="Pp">If the given URL is missing a scheme name (such as
        &quot;http://&quot; or &quot;ftp://&quot; etc) then curl makes a guess
        based on the host. If the outermost subdomain name matches DICT, FTP,
        IMAP, LDAP, POP3 or SMTP then that protocol is used, otherwise HTTP is
        used. Guessing can be avoided by providing a full URL including the
        scheme, or disabled by setting a default protocol (added in 7.45.0), see
        <i>--proto-default</i> for details.</p>
    <p class="Pp">To control where this URL is written, use the <i>-o,

  </dd>
  <dt id="A,"><a class="permalink" href="#A,">-A, --user-agent
    &lt;name&gt;</a></dt>
  <dd>(HTTP) Specify the User-Agent string to send to the HTTP server. To encode
      blanks in the string, surround the string with single quote marks. This
      header can also be set with the <i>-H, --header</i> or the
      <i>--proxy-header</i> options.
    <p class="Pp">If you give an empty argument to <i>-A, --user-agent</i>
        (&quot;&quot;), it removes the header completely from the request. If
        you prefer a blank header, you can set it to a single space (&quot;
        &quot;).</p>
    <p class="Pp">If --user-agent is provided several times, the last set value
        is used.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Example:</p>
    <pre>
<br/>
 curl -A &quot;Agent 007&quot; https://example.com</pre>
    <p class="Pp">See also <i>-H, --header</i> and <i>--proxy-header</i>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="u,"><a class="permalink" href="#u,">-u, --user
    &lt;user:password&gt;</a></dt>
  <dd>Specify the user name and password to use for server authentication.
      Overrides <i>-n, --netrc</i> and <i>--netrc-optional</i>.
    <p class="Pp">If you simply specify the user name, curl prompts for a
        password.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The user name and passwords are split up on the first colon,
        which makes it impossible to use a colon in the user name with this
        option. The password can, still.</p>
    <p class="Pp">On systems where it works, curl hides the given option
        argument from process listings. This is not enough to protect
        credentials from possibly getting seen by other users on the same system
        as they still are visible for a moment before cleared. Such sensitive
        data should be retrieved from a file instead or similar and never used
        in clear text in a command line.</p>
    <p class="Pp">When using Kerberos V5 with a Windows based server you should
        include the Windows domain name in the user name, in order for the
        server to successfully obtain a Kerberos Ticket. If you do not, then the
        initial authentication handshake may fail.</p>
    <p class="Pp">When using NTLM, the user name can be specified simply as the
        user name, without the domain, if there is a single domain and forest in
        your setup for example.</p>
    <p class="Pp">To specify the domain name use either Down-Level Logon Name or
        UPN (User Principal Name) formats. For example, EXAMPLE\user and
        user@example.com respectively.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you use a Windows SSPI-enabled curl binary and perform
        Kerberos V5, Negotiate, NTLM or Digest authentication then you can tell
        curl to select the user name and password from your environment by
        specifying a single colon with this option: &quot;-u :&quot;.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If --user is provided several times, the last set value is
        used.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Example:</p>
    <pre>
<br/>
 curl -u user:secret https://example.com</pre>
    <p class="Pp">See also <i>-n, --netrc</i> and <i>-K, --config</i>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="variable"><a class="permalink" href="#variable">--variable
    &lt;[%]name=text/@file&gt;</a></dt>
  <dd>Set a variable with &quot;name=content&quot; or &quot;name@file&quot;
      (where &quot;file&quot; can be stdin if set to a single dash (-)). The
      name is a case sensitive identifier that must consist of no other letters
      than a-z, A-Z, 0-9 or underscore. The specified content is then associated
      with this identifier.
    <p class="Pp">Setting the same variable name again overwrites the old
        contents with the new.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The contents of a variable can be referenced in a later
        command line option when that option name is prefixed with
        &quot;--expand-&quot;, and the name is used as &quot;{{name}}&quot;
        (without the quotes).</p>
    <p class="Pp"><i>--variable</i> can import environment variables into the
        name space. Opt to either require the environment variable to be set or
        provide a default value for the variable in case it is not already
      set.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><i>--variable</i> %name imports the variable called 'name' but
        exits with an error if that environment variable is not already set. To
        provide a default value if the environment variable is not set, use
        <i>--variable</i> %name=content or <i>--variable</i> %name@content. Note
        that on some systems - but not all - environment variables are case
        insensitive.</p>
    <p class="Pp">When expanding variables, curl supports a set of functions
        that can make the variable contents more convenient to use. You apply a
        function to a variable expansion by adding a colon and then list the
        desired functions in a comma-separated list that is evaluated in a
        left-to-right order. Variable content holding null bytes that are not
        encoded when expanded, causes an error.</p>

  <dt id="v,"><a class="permalink" href="#v,">-v, --verbose</a></dt>
  <dd>Makes curl verbose during the operation. Useful for debugging and seeing
      what's going on &quot;under the hood&quot;. A line starting with '&gt;'
      means &quot;header data&quot; sent by curl, '&lt;' means &quot;header
      data&quot; received by curl that is hidden in normal cases, and a line
      starting with '*' means additional info provided by curl.
    <p class="Pp">If you only want HTTP headers in the output, <i>-i,
        --include</i> or <i>-D, --dump-header</i> might be more suitable
        options.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you think this option still does not give you enough
        details, consider using <i>--trace</i> or <i>--trace-ascii</i>
      instead.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that verbose output of curl activities and network
        traffic might contain sensitive data, including user names, credentials
        or secret data content. Be aware and be careful when sharing trace logs
        with others.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This option is global and does not need to be specified for
        each use of --next.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Providing --verbose multiple times has no extra effect.

  <dt id="w,"><a class="permalink" href="#w,">-w, --write-out
    &lt;format&gt;</a></dt>
  <dd>Make curl display information on stdout after a completed transfer. The
      format is a string that may contain plain text mixed with any number of
      variables. The format can be specified as a literal &quot;string&quot;, or
      you can have curl read the format from a file with &quot;@filename&quot;
      and to tell curl to read the format from stdin you write &quot;@-&quot;.
    <p class="Pp">The variables present in the output format are substituted by
        the value or text that curl thinks fit, as described below. All
        variables are specified as %{variable_name} and to output a normal % you
        just write them as %%. You can output a newline by using \n, a carriage
        return with \r and a tab space with \t.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The output is by default written to standard output, but can
        be changed with %{stderr} and %output{}.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Output HTTP headers from the most recent request by using
        <i>%header{name}</i> where <i>name</i> is the case insensitive name of
        the header (without the trailing colon). The header contents are exactly
        as sent over the network, with leading and trailing whitespace trimmed
        (added in 7.84.0).</p>
    <p class="Pp">Select a specific target destination file to write the output
        to, by using <i>%output{name}</i> (added in curl 8.3.0) where
        <i>name</i> is the full file name. The output following that instruction
        is then written to that file. More than one <i>%output{}</i> instruction
        can be specified in the same write-out argument. If the file name cannot
        be created, curl leaves the output destination to the one used prior to
        the <i>%output{}</i> instruction. Use <i>%output{&gt;&gt;name}</i> to
        append data to an existing file.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><b>NOTE:</b> In Windows the %-symbol is a special symbol used
        to expand environment variables. In batch files all occurrences of %
        must be doubled when using this option to properly escape. If this
        option is used at the command prompt then the % cannot be escaped and
        unintended expansion is possible.</p>

  <dt id="xattr"><a class="permalink" href="#xattr">--xattr</a></dt>
  <dd>When saving output to a file, this option tells curl to store certain file
      metadata in extended file attributes. Currently, the URL is stored in the
      &quot;xdg.origin.url&quot; attribute and, for HTTP, the content type is
      stored in the &quot;mime_type&quot; attribute. If the file system does not
      support extended attributes, a warning is issued.

<p class="Pp">The environment variables can be specified in lower case or upper
    case. The lower case version has precedence. &quot;http_proxy&quot; is an
    exception as it is only available in lower case.</p>
<p class="Pp">Using an environment variable to set the proxy has the same effect
    as using the <i>-x, --proxy</i> option.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>`http_proxy` [protocol://]&lt;host&gt;[:port]</dt>
  <dd>Sets the proxy server to use for HTTP.</dd>
  <dt>`HTTPS_PROXY` [protocol://]&lt;host&gt;[:port]</dt>
  <dd>Sets the proxy server to use for HTTPS.</dd>
  <dt>`[url-protocol]_PROXY` [protocol://]&lt;host&gt;[:port]</dt>
  <dd>Sets the proxy server to use for [url-protocol], where the protocol is a
      protocol that curl supports and as specified in a URL. FTP, FTPS, POP3,
      IMAP, SMTP, LDAP, etc.</dd>
  <dt>`ALL_PROXY` [protocol://]&lt;host&gt;[:port]</dt>
  <dd>Sets the proxy server to use if no protocol-specific proxy is set.</dd>
  <dt>`NO_PROXY` &lt;comma-separated list of hosts/domains&gt;</dt>
  <dd>list of host names that should not go through any proxy. If set to an
      asterisk '*' only, it matches all hosts. Each name in this list is matched
      as either a domain name which contains the hostname, or the hostname
      itself.
    <p class="Pp">This environment variable disables use of the proxy even when
        specified with the <i>-x, --proxy</i> option. That is</p>
    <pre>
NO_PROXY=direct.example.com curl -x http://proxy.example.com
http://direct.example.com</pre>
    <p class="Pp">accesses the target URL directly, and</p>
    <pre>
NO_PROXY=direct.example.com curl -x http://proxy.example.com
http://somewhere.example.com</pre>
    <p class="Pp">accesses the target URL through the proxy.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The list of host names can also be include numerical IP
        addresses, and IPv6 versions should then be given without enclosing
        brackets.</p>
    <p class="Pp">IP addresses can be specified using CIDR notation: an appended
        slash and number specifies the number of &quot;network bits&quot; out of
        the address to use in the comparison (added in 7.86.0). For example
        &quot;192.168.0.0/16&quot; would match all addresses starting with
        &quot;192.168&quot;.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>`APPDATA` &lt;dir&gt;</dt>
  <dd>On Windows, this variable is used when trying to find the home directory.
      If the primary home variable are all unset.</dd>
  <dt>`COLUMNS` &lt;terminal width&gt;</dt>
  <dd>If set, the specified number of characters is used as the terminal width
      when the alternative progress-bar is shown. If not set, curl tries to
      figure it out using other ways.</dd>
  <dt>`CURL_CA_BUNDLE` &lt;file&gt;</dt>
  <dd>If set, it is used as the <i>--cacert</i> value. This environment variable
      is ignored if Schannel is used as the TLS backend.</dd>
  <dt>`CURL_HOME` &lt;dir&gt;</dt>
  <dd>If set, is the first variable curl checks when trying to find its home
      directory. If not set, it continues to check <i>XDG_CONFIG_HOME</i></dd>
  <dt>`CURL_SSL_BACKEND` &lt;TLS backend&gt;</dt>
  <dd>If curl was built with support for &quot;MultiSSL&quot;, meaning that it
      has built-in support for more than one TLS backend, this environment
      variable can be set to the case insensitive name of the particular backend
      to use when curl is invoked. Setting a name that is not a built-in
      alternative makes curl stay with the default.
    <p class="Pp">SSL backend names (case-insensitive): <b>bearssl</b>,
        <b>gnutls</b>, <b>mbedtls</b>, <b>openssl</b>, <b>rustls</b>,
        <b>schannel</b>, <b>secure-transport</b>, <b>wolfssl</b></p>
  </dd>
  <dt>`HOME` &lt;dir&gt;</dt>
  <dd>If set, this is used to find the home directory when that is needed. Like
      when looking for the default .curlrc. <i>CURL_HOME</i> and
      <i>XDG_CONFIG_HOME</i> have preference.</dd>
  <dt>`QLOGDIR` &lt;directory name&gt;</dt>
  <dd>If curl was built with HTTP/3 support, setting this environment variable
      to a local directory makes curl produce <b>qlogs</b> in that directory,
      using file names named after the destination connection id (in hex). Do
      note that these files can become rather large. Works with the ngtcp2 and
      quiche QUIC backends.</dd>
  <dt>`SHELL`</dt>
  <dd>Used on VMS when trying to detect if using a <b>DCL</b> or a <b>unix</b>
      shell.</dd>
  <dt>`SSL_CERT_DIR` &lt;dir&gt;</dt>
  <dd>If set, it is used as the <i>--capath</i> value. This environment variable
      is ignored if Schannel is used as the TLS backend.</dd>
  <dt>`SSL_CERT_FILE` &lt;path&gt;</dt>
  <dd>If set, it is used as the <i>--cacert</i> value. This environment variable
      is ignored if Schannel is used as the TLS backend.</dd>
  <dt>`SSLKEYLOGFILE` &lt;file name&gt;</dt>
  <dd>If you set this environment variable to a file name, curl stores TLS
      secrets from its connections in that file when invoked to enable you to
      analyze the TLS traffic in real time using network analyzing tools such as
      Wireshark. This works with the following TLS backends: OpenSSL, libressl,
      BoringSSL, GnuTLS and wolfSSL.</dd>
  <dt>`USERPROFILE` &lt;dir&gt;</dt>
  <dd>On Windows, this variable is used when trying to find the home directory.
      If the other, primary, variable are all unset. If set, curl uses the path
      <b>&quot;$USERPROFILE\Application Data&quot;</b>.</dd>
  <dt>`XDG_CONFIG_HOME` &lt;dir&gt;</dt>
  <dd>If <i>CURL_HOME</i> is not set, this variable is checked when looking for
      a default .curlrc file.</dd>
