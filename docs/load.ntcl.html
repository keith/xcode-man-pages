   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

<p class="Pp">This command loads binary code from a file into the application's
    address space and calls an initialization procedure in the package to
    incorporate it into an interpreter. <i>fileName</i> is the name of the file
    containing the code; its exact form varies from system to system but on most
    systems it is a shared library, such as a <b>.so</b> file under Solaris or a
    DLL under Windows. <i>packageName</i> is the name of the package, and is
    used to compute the name of an initialization procedure. <i>interp</i> is
    the path name of the interpreter into which to load the package (see the
    <b>interp</b> manual entry for details); if <i>interp</i> is omitted, it
    defaults to the interpreter in which the <b>load</b> command was
  invoked.</p>
<p class="Pp">Once the file has been loaded into the application's address
    space, one of two initialization procedures will be invoked in the new code.
    Typically the initialization procedure will add new commands to a Tcl
    interpreter. The name of the initialization procedure is determined by
    <i>packageName</i> and whether or not the target interpreter is a safe one.
    For normal interpreters the name of the initialization procedure will have
    the form <i>pkg</i><b>_Init</b>, where <i>pkg</i> is the same as
    <i>packageName</i> except that the first letter is converted to upper case
    and all other letters are converted to lower case. For example, if
    <i>packageName</i> is <b>foo</b> or <b>FOo</b>, the initialization
    procedure's name will be <b>Foo_Init</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the target interpreter is a safe interpreter, then the name of
    the initialization procedure will be <i>pkg</i><b>_SafeInit</b> instead of
    <i>pkg</i><b>_Init</b>. The <i>pkg</i><b>_SafeInit</b> function should be
    written carefully, so that it initializes the safe interpreter only with
    partial functionality provided by the package that is safe for use by
    untrusted code. For more information on Safe-Tcl, see the <b>safe</b> manual
    entry.</p>
<p class="Pp">The initialization procedure must match the following
  prototype:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
typedef int Tcl_PackageInitProc(Tcl_Interp *<i>interp</i>);</pre>
</div>
The <i>interp</i> argument identifies the interpreter in which the package is to
  be loaded. The initialization procedure must return <b>TCL_OK</b> or
  <b>TCL_ERROR</b> to indicate whether or not it completed successfully; in the
  event of an error it should set the interpreter's result to point to an error
  message. The result of the <b>load</b> command will be the result returned by
  the initialization procedure.
<p class="Pp">The actual loading of a file will only be done once for each
    <i>fileName</i> in an application. If a given <i>fileName</i> is loaded into
    multiple interpreters, then the first <b>load</b> will load the code and
    call the initialization procedure; subsequent <b>load</b>s will call the
    initialization procedure without loading the code again. For Tcl versions
    lower than 8.5, it is not possible to unload or reload a package. From
    version 8.5 however, the <b>unload</b> command allows the unloading of
    libraries loaded with <b>load</b>, for libraries that are aware of the Tcl's
    unloading mechanism.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>load</b> command also supports packages that are statically
    linked with the application, if those packages have been registered by
    calling the <b>Tcl_StaticPackage</b> procedure. If <i>fileName</i> is an
    empty string, then <i>packageName</i> must be specified.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <i>packageName</i> is omitted or specified as an empty string,
    Tcl tries to guess the name of the package. This may be done differently on
    different platforms. The default guess, which is used on most UNIX
    platforms, is to take the last element of <i>fileName</i>, strip off the
    first three characters if they are <b>lib</b>, and use any following
    alphabetic and underline characters as the module name. For example, the
    command <b>load libxyz4.2.so</b> uses the module name <b>xyz</b> and the
    command <b>load bin/last.so {}</b> uses the module name <b>last</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <i>fileName</i> is an empty string, then <i>packageName</i>
    must be specified. The <b>load</b> command first searches for a statically
    loaded package (one that has been registered by calling the
    <b>Tcl_StaticPackage</b> procedure) by that name; if one is found, it is
    used. Otherwise, the <b>load</b> command searches for a dynamically loaded
    package by that name, and uses it if it is found. If several different files
    have been <b>load</b>ed with different versions of the package, Tcl picks
    the file that was loaded first.</p>

  <dd>When a load fails with &#x201C;library not found&#x201D; error, it is also
      possible that a dependent library was not found. To see the dependent
      libraries, type &#x201C;dumpbin -imports &lt;dllname&gt;&#x201D; in a DOS
      console to see what the library must import. When loading a DLL in the
      current directory, Windows will ignore &#x201C;./&#x201D; as a path
      specifier and use a search heuristic to find the DLL instead. To avoid
      this, load the DLL with:</dd>
