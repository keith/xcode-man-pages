   Set up some character translations and predefined strings.  \*(-- will
   give an unbreakable dash, \*(PI will give pi, \*(L" will give a left
   double quote, and \*(R" will give a right double quote.  \*(C+ will
   give a nicer C++.  Capital omega is used to do unbreakable dashes and
   therefore won't be available.  \*(C` and \*(C' expand to `' in nroff,
   nothing in troff, for use with C<>.

perl5123delta - what is new for perl v5.12.3
</section>

<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
This document describes differences between the 5.12.2 release and the 5.12.3
  release.
<p class="Pp">If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.12.1, first
    read perl5122delta, which describes differences between 5.12.1 and 5.12.2.
    The major changes made in 5.12.0 are described in perl5120delta.</p>

<pre>
    There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.12.2. If any
    exist, they are bugs and reports are welcome.

You can now use the <span class="Li">&quot;keys&quot;</span>,
  <span class="Li">&quot;values&quot;</span>,
  <span class="Li">&quot;each&quot;</span> builtin functions on arrays
  (previously you could only use them on hashes). See perlfunc for details. This
  is actually a change introduced in perl 5.12.0, but it was missed from that
  release's perldelta.

&quot;no VERSION&quot; will now correctly deparse with B::Deparse, as will
  certain constant expressions.
<p class="Pp">Module::Build should be more reliably pass its tests under
  cygwin.</p>
<p class="Pp">Lvalue subroutines are again able to return copy-on-write scalars.
    This had been broken since version 5.10.0.</p>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>Solaris</dt>
  <dd>A separate DTrace is now build for miniperl, which means that perl can be
      compiled with -Dusedtrace on Solaris again.</dd>
  <dt>VMS</dt>
  <dd>A number of regressions on VMS have been fixed. In addition to minor
      cleanup of questionable expressions in <i>vms.c</i>, file permissions
      should no longer be garbled by the PerlIO layer, and spurious record
      boundaries should no longer be introduced by the PerlIO layer during
      output.
    <p class="Pp">For more details and discussion on the latter, see:</p>

  <dt>VOS</dt>
  <dd>A few very small changes were made to the build process on VOS to better
      support the platform. Longer-than-32-character filenames are now supported
      on OpenVOS, and build properly without IPv6 support.</dd>

<h1 class="Sh" id="Reporting_Bugs"><a class="permalink" href="#Reporting_Bugs">Reporting
  Bugs</a></h1>
If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
  posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
  http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ . There may also be information at
  http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.
<p class="Pp">If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the
    <b>perlbug</b> program included with your release. Be sure to trim your bug
    down to a tiny but sufficient test case. Your bug report, along with the
    output of <span class="Li">&quot;perl -V&quot;</span>, will be sent off to
    perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make
    it inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please
    send it to perl5-security-report@perl.org. This points to a closed
    subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core
    committers, who will be able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out
    a resolution, and help co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix
    the problem across all platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use
    this address for security issues in the Perl core, not for modules
    independently distributed on CPAN.</p>
