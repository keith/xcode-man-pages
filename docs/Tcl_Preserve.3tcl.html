   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

  .b

  	# BS - start boxed text
  	# ^y = starting y location

  	# BE - end boxed text (draw box now)
  	Draw four-sided box normally, but don't draw top of
  	box if the box started on an earlier page.
  	# VS - start vertical sidebar
  	# ^Y = starting y location
  	# ^v = 1 (for troff;  for nroff this doesn't matter)
  	# VE - end of vertical sidebar
  	# Special macro to handle page bottom:  finish off current
  	# box/sidebar if in box/sidebar mode, then invoked standard
  	# page bottom macro.
  	Draw three-sided box if this is the box's first page,
  	draw two sides but no top otherwise.
  	# DS - begin display

These three procedures help implement a simple reference count mechanism for
  managing storage. They are designed to solve a problem having to do with
  widget deletion, but are also useful in many other situations. When a widget
  is deleted, its widget record (the structure holding information specific to
  the widget) must be returned to the storage allocator. However, it is possible
  that the widget record is in active use by one of the procedures on the stack
  at the time of the deletion. This can happen, for example, if the command
  associated with a button widget causes the button to be destroyed: an X event
  causes an event-handling C procedure in the button to be invoked, which in
  turn causes the button's associated Tcl command to be executed, which in turn
  causes the button to be deleted, which in turn causes the button's widget
  record to be de-allocated. Unfortunately, when the Tcl command returns, the
  button's event-handling procedure will need to reference the button's widget
  record. Because of this, the widget record must not be freed as part of the
  deletion, but must be retained until the event-handling procedure has finished
  with it. In other situations where the widget is deleted, it may be possible
  to free the widget record immediately.
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_Preserve</b> and <b>Tcl_Release</b> implement short-term
    reference counts for their <i>clientData</i> argument. The <i>clientData</i>
    argument identifies an object and usually consists of the address of a
    structure. The reference counts guarantee that an object will not be freed
    until each call to <b>Tcl_Preserve</b> for the object has been matched by
    calls to <b>Tcl_Release</b>. There may be any number of unmatched
    <b>Tcl_Preserve</b> calls in effect at once.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_EventuallyFree</b> is invoked to free up its
    <i>clientData</i> argument. It checks to see if there are unmatched
    <b>Tcl_Preserve</b> calls for the object. If not, then
    <b>Tcl_EventuallyFree</b> calls <i>freeProc</i> immediately. Otherwise
    <b>Tcl_EventuallyFree</b> records the fact that <i>clientData</i> needs
    eventually to be freed. When all calls to <b>Tcl_Preserve</b> have been
    matched with calls to <b>Tcl_Release</b> then <i>freeProc</i> will be called
    by <b>Tcl_Release</b> to do the cleanup.</p>
<p class="Pp">All the work of freeing the object is carried out by
    <i>freeProc</i>. <i>FreeProc</i> must have arguments and result that match
    the type <b>Tcl_FreeProc</b>:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
typedef void Tcl_FreeProc(char *<i>blockPtr</i>);
</pre>
</div>
The <i>blockPtr</i> argument to <i>freeProc</i> will be the same as the
  <i>clientData</i> argument to <b>Tcl_EventuallyFree</b>. The type of
  <i>blockPtr</i> (<b>char *</b>) is different than the type of the
  <i>clientData</i> argument to <b>Tcl_EventuallyFree</b> for historical
  reasons, but the value is the same.
<p class="Pp">When the <i>clientData</i> argument to <b>Tcl_EventuallyFree</b>
    refers to storage allocated and returned by a prior call to
    <b>Tcl_Alloc</b>, <b>ckalloc</b>, or another function of the Tcl library,
    then the <i>freeProc</i> argument should be given the special value of
    <b>TCL_DYNAMIC</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">This mechanism can be used to solve the problem described above by
    placing <b>Tcl_Preserve</b> and <b>Tcl_Release</b> calls around actions that
    may cause undesired storage re-allocation. The mechanism is intended only
    for short-term use (i.e. while procedures are pending on the stack); it will
    not work efficiently as a mechanism for long-term reference counts. The
    implementation does not depend in any way on the internal structure of the
    objects being freed; it keeps the reference counts in a separate
  structure.</p>
