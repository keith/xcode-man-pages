<p class="Pp">The <b>sudoers</b> policy plugin determines a user's <b>sudo</b>
    privileges. It is the default <b>sudo</b> policy plugin. The policy is
    driven by the <i>/private/etc/sudoers</i> file or, optionally in LDAP. The
    policy format is described in detail in the <i>SUDOERS FILE FORMAT</i>
    section. For information on storing <b>sudoers</b> policy information in
    LDAP, please see sudoers.ldap(5).</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Configuring_sudo.conf_for_sudoers"><a class="permalink" href="#Configuring_sudo.conf_for_sudoers">Configuring
  sudo.conf for sudoers</a></h2>
<p class="Pp"><b>sudo</b> consults the sudo.conf(5) file to determine which
    policy and I/O logging plugins to load. If no sudo.conf(5) file is present,
    or if it contains no Plugin lines, <b>sudoers</b> will be used for policy
    decisions and I/O logging. To explicitly configure sudo.conf(5) to use the
    <b>sudoers</b> plugin, the following configuration can be used.</p>
<pre>
</pre>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>Plugin sudoers_audit sudoers.so
Plugin sudoers_policy sudoers.so
Plugin sudoers_io sudoers.so</pre>
</div>
<pre></pre>
<p class="Pp">Starting with <b>sudo</b> 1.8.5, it is possible to specify
    optional arguments to the <b>sudoers</b> plugin in the sudo.conf(5) file.
    Plugin arguments, if any, should be listed after the path to the plugin
    (i.e., after <i>sudoers.so</i>). The arguments are only effective for the
    plugin that opens (and parses) the <i>sudoers</i> file.</p>
<p class="Pp">For <b>sudo</b> version 1.9.1 and higher, this is the
    <i>sudoers_audit</i> plugin. For older versions, it is the
    <i>sudoers_policy</i> plugin. Multiple arguments may be specified, separated
    by white space. For example:</p>
<pre>
</pre>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>Plugin sudoers_audit sudoers.so sudoers_mode=0400 error_recovery=false</pre>
</div>
<pre></pre>
<p class="Pp">The following plugin arguments are supported:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="error_recovery=bool"><a class="permalink" href="#error_recovery=bool">error_recovery=bool</a></dt>
  <dd>The <i>error_recovery</i> argument can be used to control whether
      <b>sudoers</b> should attempt to recover from syntax errors in the
      <i>sudoers</i> file. If set to <i>true</i> (the default), <b>sudoers</b>
      will try to recover from a syntax error by discarding the portion of the
      line that contains the error until the end of the line. A value of
      <i>false</i> will disable error recovery. Prior to version 1.9.3, no error
      recovery was performed.</dd>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="User_Authentication"><a class="permalink" href="#User_Authentication">User
  Authentication</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The <b>sudoers</b> security policy requires that most users
    authenticate themselves before they can use <b>sudo</b>. A password is not
    required if the invoking user is root, if the target user is the same as the
    invoking user, or if the policy has disabled authentication for the user or
    command. Unlike su(1), when <b>sudoers</b> requires authentication, it
    validates the invoking user's credentials, not the target user's (or root's)
    credentials. This can be changed via the <i>rootpw</i>, <i>targetpw</i> and
    <i>runaspw</i> flags, described later.</p>
<p class="Pp">If a user who is not listed in the policy tries to run a command
    via <b>sudo</b>, mail is sent to the proper authorities. The address used
    for such mail is configurable via the <i>mailto</i> Defaults entry
    (described later) and defaults to root.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that no mail will be sent if an unauthorized user tries to
    run <b>sudo</b> with the <b>-l</b> or <b>-v</b> option unless there is an
    authentication error and either the <i>mail_always</i> or
    <i>mail_badpass</i> flags are enabled. This allows users to determine for
    themselves whether or not they are allowed to use <b>sudo</b>. By default,
    all attempts to run <b>sudo</b> (successful or not) are logged, regardless
    of whether or not mail is sent.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <b>sudo</b> is run by root and the SUDO_USER environment
    variable is set, the <b>sudoers</b> policy will use this value to determine
    who the actual user is. This can be used by a user to log commands through
    sudo even when a root shell has been invoked. It also allows the <b>-e</b>
    option to remain useful even when invoked via a sudo-run script or program.
    Note, however, that the <i>sudoers</i> file lookup is still done for root,
    not the user specified by SUDO_USER.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>sudoers</b> uses per-user time stamp files for credential
    caching. Once a user has been authenticated, a record is written containing
    the user-ID that was used to authenticate, the terminal session ID, the
    start time of the session leader (or parent process) and a time stamp (using
    a monotonic clock if one is available). The user may then use <b>sudo</b>
    without a password for a short period of time (5 minutes unless overridden
    by the <i>timestamp_timeout</i> option) . By default, <b>sudoers</b> uses a
    separate record for each terminal, which means that a user's login sessions
    are authenticated separately. The <i>timestamp_type</i> option can be used
    to select the type of time stamp record <b>sudoers</b> will use.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Logging"><a class="permalink" href="#Logging">Logging</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">By default, <b>sudoers</b> logs both successful and unsuccessful
    attempts (as well as errors). The <i>log_allowed</i> and <i>log_denied</i>
    flags can be used to control this behavior. Messages can be logged to
    syslog(3), a log file, or both. The default is to log to syslog(3) but this
    is configurable via the <i>syslog</i> and <i>logfile</i> settings. See
    <i>LOG FORMAT</i> for a description of the log file format.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>sudoers</b> is also capable of running a command in a
    pseudo-terminal and logging all input and/or output. The standard input,
    standard output and standard error can be logged even when not associated
    with a terminal. I/O logging is not on by default but can be enabled using
    the <i>log_input</i> and <i>log_output</i> options as well as the LOG_INPUT
    and LOG_OUTPUT command tags. See <i>I/O LOG FILES</i> for details on how I/O
    log files are stored.</p>
<p class="Pp">Starting with version 1.9, the <i>log_servers</i> setting may be
    used to send event and I/O log data to a remote server running
    <b>sudo_logsrvd</b> or another service that implements the protocol
    described by sudo_logsrv.proto(5).</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Command_environment"><a class="permalink" href="#Command_environment">Command
  environment</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Since environment variables can influence program behavior,
    <b>sudoers</b> provides a means to restrict which variables from the user's
    environment are inherited by the command to be run. There are two distinct
    ways <b>sudoers</b> can deal with environment variables.</p>
<p class="Pp">By default, the <i>env_reset</i> flag is enabled. This causes
    commands to be executed with a new, minimal environment. On AIX (and Linux
    systems without PAM), the environment is initialized with the contents of
    the <i>/etc/environment</i> file. The HOME, MAIL, SHELL, LOGNAME and USER
    environment variables are initialized based on the target user and the
    SUDO_* variables are set based on the invoking user. Additional variables,
    such as DISPLAY, PATH and TERM, are preserved from the invoking user's
    environment if permitted by the <i>env_check</i> or <i>env_keep</i> options.
    A few environment variables are treated specially. If the PATH and TERM
    variables are not preserved from the user's environment, they will be set to
    default values. The LOGNAME and USER are handled as a single entity. If one
    of them is preserved (or removed) from the user's environment, the other
    will be as well. If LOGNAME and USER are to be preserved but only one of
    them is present in the user's environment, the other will be set to the same
    value. This avoids an inconsistent environment where one of the variables
    describing the user name is set to the invoking user and one is set to the
    target user. Environment variables with a value beginning with () are
    removed unless both the name and value parts are matched by <i>env_keep</i>
    or <i>env_check</i>, as they may be interpreted as functions by the
    <b>bash</b> shell. Prior to version 1.8.11, such variables were always
    removed.</p>
<p class="Pp">If, however, the <i>env_reset</i> flag is disabled, any variables
    not explicitly denied by the <i>env_check</i> and <i>env_delete</i> options
    are allowed and their values are inherited from the invoking process. Prior
    to version 1.8.21, environment variables with a value beginning with () were
    always removed. Beginning with version 1.8.21, a pattern in
    <i>env_delete</i> is used to match <b>bash</b> shell functions instead.
    Since it is not possible to block all potentially dangerous environment
    variables, use of the default <i>env_reset</i> behavior is encouraged.</p>
<p class="Pp">Environment variables specified by <i>env_check</i>,
    <i>env_delete</i>, or <i>env_keep</i> may include one or more
    &#x2018;*&#x2019; characters which will match zero or more characters. No
    other wildcard characters are supported.</p>
<p class="Pp">By default, environment variables are matched by name. However, if
    the pattern includes an equal sign (&#x2018;=&#x2019;), both the variables
    name and value must match. For example, a <b>bash</b> shell function could
    be matched as follows:</p>
<pre>
</pre>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>env_keep += &quot;BASH_FUNC_my_func%%=()*&quot;</pre>
</div>
<pre></pre>
<p class="Pp">Without the &#x201C;=()*&#x201D; suffix, this would not match, as
    <b>bash</b> shell functions are not preserved by default.</p>
<p class="Pp">The complete list of environment variables that are preserved or
    removed, as modified by global Defaults parameters in <i>sudoers</i>, is
    displayed when <b>sudo</b> is run by root with the <b>-V</b> option. Please
    note that the list of environment variables to remove varies based on the
    operating system <b>sudo</b> is running on.</p>
<p class="Pp">Other <b>sudoers</b> options may influence the command
    environment, such as <i>always_set_home</i>, <i>secure_path</i>,
    <i>set_logname</i>, and <i>set_home</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">On systems that support PAM where the <b>pam_env</b> module is
    enabled for <b>sudo</b>, variables in the PAM environment may be merged in
    to the environment. If a variable in the PAM environment is already present
    in the user's environment, the value will only be overridden if the variable
    was not preserved by <b>sudoers</b>. When <i>env_reset</i> is enabled,
    variables preserved from the invoking user's environment by the
    <i>env_keep</i> list take precedence over those in the PAM environment. When
    <i>env_reset</i> is disabled, variables present the invoking user's
    environment take precedence over those in the PAM environment unless they
    match a pattern in the <i>env_delete</i> list.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that the dynamic linker on most operating systems will remove
    variables that can control dynamic linking from the environment of
    set-user-ID executables, including <b>sudo</b>. Depending on the operating
    system this may include _RLD*, DYLD_*, LD_*, LDR_*, LIBPATH, SHLIB_PATH, and
    others. These type of variables are removed from the environment before
    <b>sudo</b> even begins execution and, as such, it is not possible for
    <b>sudo</b> to preserve them.</p>
<p class="Pp">As a special case, if the <b>-i</b> option (initial login) is
    specified, <b>sudoers</b> will initialize the environment regardless of the
    value of <i>env_reset</i>. The DISPLAY, PATH and TERM variables remain
    unchanged; HOME, MAIL, SHELL, USER, and LOGNAME are set based on the target
    user. On AIX (and Linux systems without PAM), the contents of
    <i>/etc/environment</i> are also included. All other environment variables
    are removed unless permitted by <i>env_keep</i> or <i>env_check</i>,
    described above.</p>
<p class="Pp">Finally, the <i>restricted_env_file</i> and <i>env_file</i> files
    are applied, if present. The variables in <i>restricted_env_file</i> are
    applied first and are subject to the same restrictions as the invoking
    user's environment, as detailed above. The variables in <i>env_file</i> are
    applied last and are not subject to these restrictions. In both cases,
    variables present in the files will only be set to their specified values if
    they would not conflict with an existing environment variable.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="SUDOERS_FILE_FORMAT"><a class="permalink" href="#SUDOERS_FILE_FORMAT">SUDOERS

<p class="Pp">The <i>sudoers</i> file is composed of two types of entries:
    aliases (basically variables) and user specifications (which specify who may
    run what).</p>
<p class="Pp">When multiple entries match for a user, they are applied in order.
    Where there are multiple matches, the last match is used (which is not
    necessarily the most specific match).</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>sudoers</i> file grammar will be described below in
    Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF). Don't despair if you are unfamiliar with
    EBNF; it is fairly simple, and the definitions below are annotated.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Quick_guide_to_EBNF"><a class="permalink" href="#Quick_guide_to_EBNF">Quick
  guide to EBNF</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">EBNF is a concise and exact way of describing the grammar of a
    language. Each EBNF definition is made up of <i>production rules</i>.
  E.g.,</p>
<p class="Pp">symbol ::= definition | alternate1 | alternate2 ...</p>
<p class="Pp">Each <i>production rule</i> references others and thus makes up a
    grammar for the language. EBNF also contains the following operators, which
    many readers will recognize from regular expressions. Do not, however,
    confuse them with &#x201C;wildcard&#x201D; characters, which have different
    meanings.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>?</dt>
  <dd>Means that the preceding symbol (or group of symbols) is optional. That
      is, it may appear once or not at all.</dd>
  <dt>*</dt>
  <dd>Means that the preceding symbol (or group of symbols) may appear zero or
      more times.</dd>
  <dt>+</dt>
  <dd>Means that the preceding symbol (or group of symbols) may appear one or
      more times.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Parentheses may be used to group symbols together. For clarity, we
    will use single quotes ('') to designate what is a verbatim character string
    (as opposed to a symbol name).</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Aliases"><a class="permalink" href="#Aliases">Aliases</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">There are four kinds of aliases: User_Alias, Runas_Alias,

</div>
<pre></pre>
<p class="Pp">A User_List is made up of one or more user names, user-IDs
    (prefixed with &#x2018;#&#x2019;), system group names and IDs (prefixed with
    &#x2018;%&#x2019; and &#x2018;%#&#x2019; respectively), netgroups (prefixed
    with &#x2018;+&#x2019;), non-Unix group names and IDs (prefixed with
    &#x2018;%:&#x2019; and &#x2018;%:#&#x2019; respectively) and User_Aliases.
    Each list item may be prefixed with zero or more &#x2018;!&#x2019;
    operators. An odd number of &#x2018;!&#x2019; operators negate the value of
    the item; an even number just cancel each other out. User netgroups are
    matched using the user and domain members only; the host member is not used
    when matching.</p>
<p class="Pp">A user name, uid, group, gid, netgroup, nonunix_group or
    nonunix_gid may be enclosed in double quotes to avoid the need for escaping
    special characters. Alternately, special characters may be specified in
    escaped hex mode, e.g., \x20 for space. When using double quotes, any prefix
    characters must be included inside the quotes.</p>
<p class="Pp">The actual nonunix_group and nonunix_gid syntax depends on the
    underlying group provider plugin. For instance, the QAS AD plugin supports
    the following formats:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>&#x2022;</b></dt>
  <dd>Group in the same domain: &quot;%:Group Name&quot;</dd>
  <dt><b>&#x2022;</b></dt>

</dl>
<p class="Pp">See <i>GROUP PROVIDER PLUGINS</i> for more information.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that quotes around group names are optional. Unquoted strings
    must use a backslash (&#x2018;\&#x2019;) to escape spaces and special
    characters. See <i>Other special characters and reserved words</i> for a
    list of characters that need to be escaped.</p>

    User_Aliases it can contain Runas_Aliases. Note that user names and groups
    are matched as strings. In other words, two users (groups) with the same
    user (group) ID are considered to be distinct. If you wish to match all user
    names with the same user-ID (e.g., root and toor), you can use a user-ID
    instead of a name (#0 in the example given). Note that the user-ID or
    group-ID specified in a Runas_Member need not be listed in the password or
    group database.</p>

<p class="Pp">A Host_List is made up of one or more host names, IP addresses,
    network numbers, netgroups (prefixed with &#x2018;+&#x2019;) and other
    aliases. Again, the value of an item may be negated with the
    &#x2018;!&#x2019; operator. Host netgroups are matched using the host (both
    qualified and unqualified) and domain members only; the user member is not
    used when matching. If you specify a network number without a netmask,
    <b>sudo</b> will query each of the local host's network interfaces and, if
    the network number corresponds to one of the hosts's network interfaces,
    will use the netmask of that interface. The netmask may be specified either
    in standard IP address notation (e.g., 255.255.255.0 or
    ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff::), or CIDR notation (number of bits, e.g., 24 or 64). A
    host name may include shell-style wildcards (see the <i>Wildcards</i>
    section below), but unless the host name command on your machine returns the
    fully qualified host name, you'll need to use the <i>fqdn</i> flag for
    wildcards to be useful. Note that <b>sudo</b> only inspects actual network
    interfaces; this means that IP address 127.0.0.1 (localhost) will never
    match. Also, the host name &#x201C;localhost&#x201D; will only match if that
    is the actual host name, which is usually only the case for non-networked
    systems.</p>

<p class="Pp">A Cmnd_List is a list of one or more command names, directories,
    and other aliases. A command name is a fully qualified file name which may
    include shell-style wildcards (see the <i>Wildcards</i> section below). A
    simple file name allows the user to run the command with any arguments they
    wish. However, you may also specify command line arguments (including
    wildcards). Alternately, you can specify &quot;&quot; to indicate that the
    command may only be run <b>without</b> command line arguments. A directory
    is a fully qualified path name ending in a &#x2018;/&#x2019;. When you
    specify a directory in a Cmnd_List, the user will be able to run any file
    within that directory (but not in any sub-directories therein).</p>
<p class="Pp">If a Cmnd has associated command line arguments, then the
    arguments in the Cmnd must match exactly those given by the user on the
    command line (or match the wildcards if there are any). Note that the
    following characters must be escaped with a &#x2018;\&#x2019; if they are
    used in command arguments: &#x2018;,&#x2019;, &#x2018;:&#x2019;,
    &#x2018;=&#x2019;, &#x2018;\&#x2019;. The built-in command
    &#x201C;sudoedit&#x201D; is used to permit a user to run <b>sudo</b> with
    the <b>-e</b> option (or as <b>sudoedit</b>). It may take command line
    arguments just as a normal command does. Note that &#x201C;sudoedit&#x201D;
    is a command built into <b>sudo</b> itself and must be specified in the
    <i>sudoers</i> file <b>without</b> a leading path. If a leading path is
    present, for example <i>/usr/bin/sudoedit</i>, the path name will be
    silently converted to &#x201C;sudoedit&#x201D;. A fully-qualified path for
    <b>sudoedit</b> is treated as an error by <b>visudo</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">A command name may be preceded by a Digest_List, a comma-separated
    list of one or more Digest_Spec entries. If a Digest_List is present, the
    command will only match successfully if it can be verified using one of the
    SHA-2 digests in the list. Starting with version 1.9.0, the <b>ALL</b>
    reserved word can be used in conjunction with a Digest_List. The following
    digest formats are supported: sha224, sha256, sha384 and sha512. The string
    may be specified in either hex or base64 format (base64 is more compact).
    There are several utilities capable of generating SHA-2 digests in hex
    format such as openssl, shasum, sha224sum, sha256sum, sha384sum,
  sha512sum.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, using openssl:</p>
<pre>
</pre>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ openssl dgst -sha224 /bin/ls
SHA224(/bin/ls)= 118187da8364d490b4a7debbf483004e8f3e053ec954309de2c41a25</pre>
</div>
<pre></pre>
<p class="Pp">It is also possible to use openssl to generate base64 output:</p>
<pre>
</pre>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ openssl dgst -binary -sha224 /bin/ls | openssl base64
EYGH2oNk1JC0p9679IMATo8+BT7JVDCd4sQaJQ==</pre>
</div>
<pre></pre>
<p class="Pp">Warning, if the user has write access to the command itself
    (directly or via a <b>sudo</b> command), it may be possible for the user to
    replace the command after the digest check has been performed but before the
    command is executed. A similar race condition exists on systems that lack
    the fexecve(2) system call when the directory in which the command is
    located is writable by the user. See the description of the <i>fdexec</i>
    setting for more information on how <b>sudo</b> executes commands that have
    an associated digest.</p>
<p class="Pp">Command digests are only supported by version 1.8.7 or higher.</p>

<p class="Pp">A <b>user specification</b> determines which commands a user may
    run (and as what user) on specified hosts. By default, commands are run as
    <b>root</b>, but this can be changed on a per-command basis.</p>
<p class="Pp">The basic structure of a user specification is &#x201C;who where =
    (as_whom) what&#x201D;. Let's break that down into its constituent
  parts:</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Runas_Spec"><a class="permalink" href="#Runas_Spec">Runas_Spec</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">A Runas_Spec determines the user and/or the group that a command
    may be run as. A fully-specified Runas_Spec consists of two Runas_Lists (as
    defined above) separated by a colon (&#x2018;:&#x2019;) and enclosed in a
    set of parentheses. The first Runas_List indicates which users the command
    may be run as via the <b>-u</b> option. The second defines a list of groups
    that can be specified via the <b>-g</b> option in addition to any of the
    target user's groups. If both Runas_Lists are specified, the command may be
    run with any combination of users and groups listed in their respective
    Runas_Lists. If only the first is specified, the command may be run as any
    user in the list but no <b>-g</b> option may be specified. If the first
    Runas_List is empty but the second is specified, the command may be run as
    the invoking user with the group set to any listed in the Runas_List. If
    both Runas_Lists are empty, the command may only be run as the invoking
    user. If no Runas_Spec is specified the command may be run as <b>root</b>
    and no group may be specified.</p>
<p class="Pp">A Runas_Spec sets the default for the commands that follow it.
    What this means is that for the entry:</p>
<pre>
</pre>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>dgb	boulder = (operator) /bin/ls, /bin/kill, /usr/bin/lprm</pre>
</div>
<pre></pre>
<p class="Pp">The user <b>dgb</b> may run <i>/bin/ls</i>, <i>/bin/kill</i>, and
    <i>/usr/bin/lprm</i> on the host boulder&#x2014;but only as <b>operator</b>.
    E.g.,</p>
<pre>
</pre>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ sudo -u operator /bin/ls</pre>
</div>
<pre></pre>
<p class="Pp">It is also possible to override a Runas_Spec later on in an entry.
    If we modify the entry like so:</p>
<pre>
</pre>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>dgb	boulder = (operator) /bin/ls, (root) /bin/kill, /usr/bin/lprm</pre>
</div>
<pre></pre>
<p class="Pp">Then user <b>dgb</b> is now allowed to run <i>/bin/ls</i> as
    <b>operator</b>, but <i>/bin/kill</i> and <i>/usr/bin/lprm</i> as
    <b>root</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">We can extend this to allow <b>dgb</b> to run /bin/ls with either
    the user or group set to <b>operator</b>:</p>
<pre>
</pre>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>dgb	boulder = (operator : operator) /bin/ls, (root) /bin/kill,\
	/usr/bin/lprm</pre>
</div>
<pre></pre>
<p class="Pp">Note that while the group portion of the Runas_Spec permits the
    user to run as command with that group, it does not force the user to do so.
    If no group is specified on the command line, the command will run with the
    group listed in the target user's password database entry. The following
    would all be permitted by the sudoers entry above:</p>
<pre>
</pre>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ sudo -u operator /bin/ls
$ sudo -u operator -g operator /bin/ls
$ sudo -g operator /bin/ls</pre>
</div>
<pre></pre>
<p class="Pp">In the following example, user <b>tcm</b> may run commands that
    access a modem device file with the dialer group.</p>
<pre>
</pre>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>tcm	boulder = (:dialer) /usr/bin/tip, /usr/bin/cu,\
	/usr/local/bin/minicom</pre>
</div>
<pre></pre>
<p class="Pp">Note that in this example only the group will be set, the command

<pre>
</pre>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ sudo -g dialer /usr/bin/cu</pre>
</div>
<pre></pre>
<p class="Pp">Multiple users and groups may be present in a Runas_Spec, in which
    case the user may select any combination of users and groups via the
    <b>-u</b> and <b>-g</b> options. In this example:</p>

</pre>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>alan	ALL = (root, bin : operator, system) ALL</pre>

    yyyymmddHHMMSSZ where the minutes and seconds are optional. The
    &#x2018;Z&#x2019; suffix indicates that the time stamp is in Coordinated
    Universal Time (UTC). It is also possible to specify a timezone offset from
    UTC in hours and minutes instead of a &#x2018;Z&#x2019;. For example,
    &#x2018;-0500&#x2019; would correspond to Eastern Standard time in the US.

        the commands that follow it in the Cmnd_Spec_List. Conversely, the
        PASSWD tag can be used to reverse things. For example:</p>
    <pre>

    <i>/bin/ls</i>, and <i>/usr/bin/lprm</i> as <b>root</b> on the machine
    rushmore without authenticating himself. If we only want <b>ray</b> to be
    able to run <i>/bin/kill</i> without a password the entry would be:</p>

</pre>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>ray	rushmore = NOPASSWD: /bin/kill, PASSWD: /bin/ls, /usr/bin/lprm</pre>

<p class="Pp">Note, however, that the PASSWD tag has no effect on users who are
    in the group specified by the <i>exempt_group</i> setting.</p>
<p class="Pp">By default, if the NOPASSWD tag is applied to any of a user's
    entries for the current host, the user will be able to run &#x201C;sudo
    -l&#x201D; without a password. Additionally, a user may only run
    &#x201C;sudo -v&#x201D; without a password if all of the user's entries for

<p class="Pp"><b>sudo</b> allows shell-style <i>wildcards</i> (aka meta or glob
    characters) to be used in host names, path names and command line arguments
    in the <i>sudoers</i> file. Wildcard matching is done via the glob(3) and
    fnmatch(3) functions as specified by IEEE Std 1003.1
    (&#x201C;POSIX.1&#x201D;).</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">

  <dd>For any character &#x2018;x&#x2019;, evaluates to &#x2018;x&#x2019;. This

      &#x2018;?&#x2019;, &#x2018;[&#x2019;, and &#x2018;]&#x2019;.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp"><b>Note that these are not regular expressions.</b> Unlike a
    regular expression there is no way to match one or more characters within a
    range.</p>
<p class="Pp">Character classes may be used if your system's glob(3) and
    fnmatch(3) functions support them. However, because the &#x2018;:&#x2019;
    character has special meaning in <i>sudoers</i>, it must be escaped. For
    example:</p>
<pre>
</pre>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>/bin/ls [[\:alpha\:]]*</pre>
</div>
<pre></pre>
<p class="Pp">Would match any file name beginning with a letter.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that a forward slash (&#x2018;/&#x2019;) will <i>not</i> be
    matched by wildcards used in the file name portion of the command. This is
    to make a path like:</p>
<pre>
</pre>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>/usr/bin/*</pre>
</div>
<pre></pre>
<p class="Pp">match <i>/usr/bin/who</i> but not <i>/usr/bin/X11/xterm</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">When matching the command line arguments, however, a slash
    <i>does</i> get matched by wildcards since command line arguments may
    contain arbitrary strings and not just path names.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Wildcards in command line arguments should be used with
    care.</b>
  <br/>
  Command line arguments are matched as a single, concatenated string. This mean
    a wildcard character such as &#x2018;?&#x2019; or &#x2018;*&#x2019; will
    match across word boundaries, which may be unexpected. For example, while a
    sudoers entry like:</p>
<pre>
</pre>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>%operator ALL = /bin/cat /var/log/messages*</pre>
</div>
<pre></pre>
<p class="Pp">will allow command like:</p>

<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ sudo cat /var/log/messages /etc/shadow</pre>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Including_other_files_from_within_sudoers"><a class="permalink" href="#Including_other_files_from_within_sudoers">Including
  other files from within sudoers</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">It is possible to include other <i>sudoers</i> files from within
    the <i>sudoers</i> file currently being parsed using the @include and
    @includedir directives. For compatibility with sudo versions prior to 1.9.1,
    #include and #includedir are also accepted.</p>
<p class="Pp">An include file can be used, for example, to keep a site-wide
    <i>sudoers</i> file in addition to a local, per-machine file. For the sake
    of this example the site-wide <i>sudoers</i> file will be
    <i>/etc/sudoers</i> and the per-machine one will be
    <i>/etc/sudoers.local</i>. To include <i>/etc/sudoers.local</i> from within
    <i>/etc/sudoers</i> one would use the following line in
  <i>/etc/sudoers</i>:</p>
<pre>
</pre>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>@include /etc/sudoers.local</pre>
</div>
<pre></pre>
<p class="Pp">When <b>sudo</b> reaches this line it will suspend processing of
    the current file (<i>/etc/sudoers</i>) and switch to
    <i>/etc/sudoers.local</i>. Upon reaching the end of
    <i>/etc/sudoers.local</i>, the rest of <i>/etc/sudoers</i> will be
    processed. Files that are included may themselves include other files. A
    hard limit of 128 nested include files is enforced to prevent include file
    loops.</p>
<p class="Pp">The path to the include file may contain white space if it is
    escaped with a backslash (&#x2018;\&#x2019;). Alternately, the entire path
    may be enclosed in double quotes (&quot;&quot;), in which case no escaping
    is necessary. To include a literal backslash in the path, &#x2018;\\&#x2019;
    should be used.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the path to the include file is not fully-qualified (does not
    begin with a &#x2018;/&#x2019;), it must be located in the same directory as
    the sudoers file it was included from. For example, if <i>/etc/sudoers</i>
    contains the line:</p>
<pre>
</pre>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>@include sudoers.local</pre>
</div>
<pre></pre>
<p class="Pp">the file that will be included is <i>/etc/sudoers.local</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The file name may also include the %h escape, signifying the short
    form of the host name. In other words, if the machine's host name is
    &#x201C;xerxes&#x201D;, then</p>
<pre>
</pre>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>@include /etc/sudoers.%h</pre>
</div>
<pre></pre>
<p class="Pp">will cause <b>sudo</b> to include the file
    <i>/etc/sudoers.xerxes</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The @includedir directive can be used to create a <i>sudoers.d</i>
    directory that the system package manager can drop <i>sudoers</i> file rules
    into as part of package installation. For example, given:</p>
<pre>
</pre>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>@includedir /etc/sudoers.d</pre>
</div>
<pre></pre>
<p class="Pp"><b>sudo</b> will suspend processing of the current file and read
    each file in <i>/etc/sudoers.d</i>, skipping file names that end in
    &#x2018;~&#x2019; or contain a &#x2018;.&#x2019; character to avoid causing
    problems with package manager or editor temporary/backup files. Files are
    parsed in sorted lexical order. That is, <i>/etc/sudoers.d/01_first</i> will
    be parsed before <i>/etc/sudoers.d/10_second</i>. Be aware that because the
    sorting is lexical, not numeric, <i>/etc/sudoers.d/1_whoops</i> would be
    loaded <i>after</i> <i>/etc/sudoers.d/10_second</i>. Using a consistent
    number of leading zeroes in the file names can be used to avoid such
    problems. After parsing the files in the directory, control returns to the
    file that contained the @includedir directive.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that unlike files included via @include, <b>visudo</b> will
    not edit the files in a @includedir directory unless one of them contains a
    syntax error. It is still possible to run <b>visudo</b> with the <b>-f</b>
    flag to edit the files directly, but this will not catch the redefinition of
    an <i>alias</i> that is also present in a different file.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Other_special_characters_and_reserved_words"><a class="permalink" href="#Other_special_characters_and_reserved_words">Other
  special characters and reserved words</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The pound sign (&#x2018;#&#x2019;) is used to indicate a comment
    (unless it is part of a #include directive or unless it occurs in the
    context of a user name and is followed by one or more digits, in which case
    it is treated as a user-ID). Both the comment character and any text after
    it, up to the end of the line, are ignored.</p>
<p class="Pp">The reserved word <b>ALL</b> is a built-in <i>alias</i> that
    always causes a match to succeed. It can be used wherever one might
    otherwise use a Cmnd_Alias, User_Alias, Runas_Alias, or Host_Alias.
    Attempting to define an <i>alias</i> named <b>ALL</b> will result in a
    syntax error. Please note that using <b>ALL</b> can be dangerous since in a
    command context, it allows the user to run <i>any</i> command on the
  system.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following option names permitted in an Option_Spec are also
    considered reserved words: CHROOT, TIMEOUT, CWD, NOTBEFORE and NOTAFTER.
    Attempting to define an <i>alias</i> with the same name as one of the
    options will result in a syntax error.</p>
<p class="Pp">An exclamation point (&#x2018;!&#x2019;) can be used as a logical
    <i>not</i> operator in a list or <i>alias</i> as well as in front of a Cmnd.
    This allows one to exclude certain values. For the &#x2018;!&#x2019;
    operator to be effective, there must be something for it to exclude. For
    example, to match all users except for root one would use:</p>
<pre>
</pre>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>ALL,!root</pre>
</div>
<pre></pre>
<p class="Pp">If the <b>ALL</b>, is omitted, as in:</p>
<pre>
</pre>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>!root</pre>
</div>
<pre></pre>
<p class="Pp">it would explicitly deny root but not match any other users. This
    is different from a true &#x201C;negation&#x201D; operator.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note, however, that using a &#x2018;!&#x2019; in conjunction with
    the built-in <b>ALL</b> alias to allow a user to run &#x201C;all but a
    few&#x201D; commands rarely works as intended (see <i>SECURITY NOTES</i>
    below).</p>
<p class="Pp">Long lines can be continued with a backslash (&#x2018;\&#x2019;)
    as the last character on the line.</p>
<p class="Pp">White space between elements in a list as well as special
    syntactic characters in a <i>User Specification</i> (&#x2018;=&#x2019;,
    &#x2018;:&#x2019;, &#x2018;(&#x2019;, &#x2018;)&#x2019;) is optional.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following characters must be escaped with a backslash
    (&#x2018;\&#x2019;) when used as part of a word (e.g., a user name or host
    name): &#x2018;!&#x2019;, &#x2018;=&#x2019;, &#x2018;:&#x2019;,

      the <i>env_reset</i> flag has been disabled or HOME is present in the

      default.</dd>
  <dt id="case_insensitive_group"><a class="permalink" href="#case_insensitive_group">case_insensitive_group</a></dt>

      This flag is <i>off</i> by default.</dd>
  <dt id="compress_io"><a class="permalink" href="#compress_io">compress_io</a></dt>
  <dd>If set, and <b>sudo</b> is configured to log a command's input or output,
      the I/O logs will be compressed using <b>zlib</b>. This flag is <i>on</i>
      by default when <b>sudo</b> is compiled with <b>zlib</b> support.</dd>
  <dt id="exec_background"><a class="permalink" href="#exec_background">exec_background</a></dt>
  <dd>By default, <b>sudo</b> runs a command as the foreground process as long
      as <b>sudo</b> itself is running in the foreground. When the
      <i>exec_background</i> flag is enabled and the command is being run in a
      pseudo-terminal (due to I/O logging or the <i>use_pty</i> flag), the
      command will be run as a background process. Attempts to read from the
      controlling terminal (or to change terminal settings) will result in the
      command being suspended with the SIGTTIN signal (or SIGTTOU in the case of
      terminal settings). If this happens when <b>sudo</b> is a foreground
      process, the command will be granted the controlling terminal and resumed
      in the foreground with no user intervention required. The advantage of
      initially running the command in the background is that <b>sudo</b> need
      not read from the terminal unless the command explicitly requests it.
      Otherwise, any terminal input must be passed to the command, whether it
      has required it or not (the kernel buffers terminals so it is not possible
      to tell whether the command really wants the input). This is different
      from historic <i>sudo</i> behavior or when the command is not being run in
      a pseudo-terminal.
    <p class="Pp">For this to work seamlessly, the operating system must support
        the automatic restarting of system calls. Unfortunately, not all
        operating systems do this by default, and even those that do may have
        bugs. For example, macOS fails to restart the <b>tcgetattr</b>() and
        <b>tcsetattr</b>() system calls (this is a bug in macOS). Furthermore,
        because this behavior depends on the command stopping with the SIGTTIN
        or SIGTTOU signals, programs that catch these signals and suspend
        themselves with a different signal (usually SIGTOP) will not be
        automatically foregrounded. Some versions of the linux su(1) command
        behave this way. This flag is <i>off</i> by default.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This setting is only supported by version 1.8.7 or higher. It
        has no effect unless I/O logging is enabled or the <i>use_pty</i> flag
        is enabled.</p>

  <dt id="env_editor"><a class="permalink" href="#env_editor">env_editor</a></dt>
  <dd>If set, <b>visudo</b> will use the value of the SUDO_EDITOR, VISUAL or
      EDITOR environment variables before falling back on the default editor
      list. Note that <b>visudo</b> is typically run as root so this flag may
      allow a user with <b>visudo</b> privileges to run arbitrary commands as
      root without logging. An alternative is to place a colon-separated list of
      &#x201C;safe&#x201D; editors int the <i>editor</i> variable. <b>visudo</b>
      will then only use SUDO_EDITOR, VISUAL or EDITOR if they match a value
      specified in <i>editor</i>. If the <i>env_reset</i> flag is enabled, the
      SUDO_EDITOR, VISUAL and/or EDITOR environment variables must be present in
      the <i>env_keep</i> list for the <i>env_editor</i> flag to function when
      <b>visudo</b> is invoked via <b>sudo</b>. This flag is <i>on</i> by
      default.</dd>
  <dt id="env_reset"><a class="permalink" href="#env_reset">env_reset</a></dt>
  <dd>If set, <b>sudo</b> will run the command in a minimal environment
      containing the TERM, PATH, HOME, MAIL, SHELL, LOGNAME, USER and SUDO_*
      variables. Any variables in the caller's environment or in the file
      specified by the <i>restricted_env_file</i> setting that match the
      env_keep and env_check lists are then added, followed by any variables
      present in the file specified by the <i>env_file</i> setting (if any). The
      contents of the env_keep and env_check lists, as modified by global
      Defaults parameters in <i>sudoers</i>, are displayed when <b>sudo</b> is
      run by root with the <b>-V</b> option. If the <i>secure_path</i> setting
      is enabled, its value will be used for the PATH environment variable. This
      flag is <i>on</i> by default.</dd>
  <dt id="fast_glob"><a class="permalink" href="#fast_glob">fast_glob</a></dt>
  <dd>Normally, <b>sudo</b> uses the glob(3) function to do shell-style globbing
      when matching path names. However, since it accesses the file system,
      glob(3) can take a long time to complete for some patterns, especially
      when the pattern references a network file system that is mounted on
      demand (auto mounted). The <i>fast_glob</i> flag causes <b>sudo</b> to use
      the fnmatch(3) function, which does not access the file system to do its
      matching. The disadvantage of <i>fast_glob</i> is that it is unable to
      match relative path names such as <i>./ls</i> or <i>../bin/ls</i>. This
      has security implications when path names that include globbing characters
      are used with the negation operator, &#x2018;!&#x2019;, as such rules can
      be trivially bypassed. As such, this flag should not be used when the
      <i>sudoers</i> file contains rules that contain negated path names which
      include globbing characters. This flag is <i>off</i> by default.</dd>
  <dt id="fqdn"><a class="permalink" href="#fqdn">fqdn</a></dt>
  <dd>Set this flag if you want to put fully qualified host names in the
      <i>sudoers</i> file when the local host name (as returned by the hostname
      command) does not contain the domain name. In other words, instead of
      myhost you would use myhost.mydomain.edu. You may still use the short form
      if you wish (and even mix the two). This flag is only effective when the
      &#x201C;canonical&#x201D; host name, as returned by the
      <b>getaddrinfo</b>() or <b>gethostbyname</b>() function, is a
      fully-qualified domain name. This is usually the case when the system is
      configured to use DNS for host name resolution.
    <p class="Pp">If the system is configured to use the <i>/etc/hosts</i> file
        in preference to DNS, the &#x201C;canonical&#x201D; host name may not be
        fully-qualified. The order that sources are queried for host name
        resolution is usually specified in the <i>/etc/nsswitch.conf</i>,
        <i>/etc/netsvc.conf</i>, <i>/etc/host.conf</i>, or, in some cases,

      small, it may be prohibitively expensive and running commands via

      to use the <i>match_group_by_gid</i> flag to avoid resolving the user's
      group-IDs to group names. In this case, <b>sudoers</b> must look up any
      group name listed in the <i>sudoers</i> file and use the group-ID instead
      of the group name when determining whether the user is a member of the

  LOG FILES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">When I/O logging is enabled, <b>sudo</b> will run the command in a
    pseudo-terminal and log all user input and/or output, depending on which
    options are enabled. I/O can be logged either to the local machine or to a
    remote log server. For local logs, I/O is logged to the directory specified
    by the <i>iolog_dir</i> option (<i>/var/log/sudo-io</i> by default) using a
    unique session ID that is included in the <b>sudo</b> log line, prefixed
    with &#x201C;TSID=&#x201D;. The <i>iolog_file</i> option may be used to
    control the format of the session ID. For remote logs, the
    <i>log_servers</i> setting is used to specify one or more log servers
    running <b>sudo_logsrvd</b> or another server that implements the protocol
    described by sudo_logsrv.proto(5).</p>
<p class="Pp">For both local and remote I/O logs, each log is stored in a
    separate directory that contains the following files:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="log"><a class="permalink" href="#log"><i>log</i></a></dt>
  <dd>A text file containing information about the command. The first line
      consists of the following colon-delimited fields: the time the command was
      run, the name of the user who ran <b>sudo</b>, the name of the target
      user, the name of the target group (optional), the terminal that
      <b>sudo</b> was run from, and the number of lines and columns of the
      terminal. The second and third lines contain the working directory the
      command was run from and the path name of the command itself (with
      arguments if present).</dd>
  <dt id="log.json"><a class="permalink" href="#log.json"><i>log.json</i></a></dt>
  <dd>A JSON-formatted file containing information about the command. This is

<p class="Pp">All files other than <i>log</i> are compressed in gzip format
    unless the <i>compress_io</i> flag has been disabled. Due to buffering, it
    is not normally possible to display the I/O logs in real-time as the program
    is executing. The I/O log data will not be complete until the program run by
    <b>sudo</b> has exited or has been terminated by a signal. The
    <i>iolog_flush</i> flag can be used to disable buffering, in which case I/O
    log data is written to disk as soon as it is available. The output portion
    of an I/O log file can be viewed with the sudoreplay(8) utility, which can
    also be used to list or search the available logs.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that user input may contain sensitive information such as
    passwords (even if they are not echoed to the screen), which will be stored
    in the log file unencrypted. In most cases, logging the command output via
    <i>log_output</i> or LOG_OUTPUT is all that is required.</p>
<p class="Pp">Since each session's I/O logs are stored in a separate directory,
    traditional log rotation utilities cannot be used to limit the number of I/O
    logs. The simplest way to limit the number of I/O is by setting the
    <i>maxseq</i> option to the maximum number of logs you wish to store. Once
    the I/O log sequence number reaches <i>maxseq</i>, it will be reset to zero
    and <b>sudoers</b> will truncate and re-use any existing I/O logs.</p>

  of the &#x2018;!&#x2019; operator</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">It is generally not effective to &#x201C;subtract&#x201D; commands
    from <b>ALL</b> using the &#x2018;!&#x2019; operator. A user can trivially
    circumvent this by copying the desired command to a different name and then
    executing that. For example:</p>
<pre>
</pre>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>bill	ALL = ALL, !SU, !SHELLS</pre>
</div>
<pre></pre>
<p class="Pp">Doesn't really prevent <b>bill</b> from running the commands
    listed in <i>SU</i> or <i>SHELLS</i> since he can simply copy those commands
    to a different name, or use a shell escape from an editor or other program.
    Therefore, these kind of restrictions should be considered advisory at best
    (and reinforced by policy).</p>
<p class="Pp">In general, if a user has sudo <b>ALL</b> there is nothing to
    prevent them from creating their own program that gives them a root shell
    (or making their own copy of a shell) regardless of any &#x2018;!&#x2019;
    elements in the user specification.</p>

<p class="Pp">If the <i>fast_glob</i> option is in use, it is not possible to
    reliably negate commands where the path name includes globbing (aka
    wildcard) characters. This is because the C library's fnmatch(3) function
    cannot resolve relative paths. While this is typically only an inconvenience
    for rules that grant privileges, it can result in a security issue for rules
    that subtract or revoke privileges.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, given the following <i>sudoers</i> file entry:</p>
<pre>
</pre>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>john	ALL = /usr/bin/passwd [a-zA-Z0-9]*, /usr/bin/chsh [a-zA-Z0-9]*,\

<pre></pre>
<p class="Pp">User <b>john</b> can still run /usr/bin/passwd root if

    issue since it is not uncommon for a program to allow shell escapes, which
    lets a user bypass <b>sudo</b>'s access control and logging. Common programs
    that permit shell escapes include shells (obviously), editors, paginators,
    mail and terminal programs.</p>
<p class="Pp">There are two basic approaches to this problem:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="restrict"><a class="permalink" href="#restrict">restrict</a></dt>
  <dd>Avoid giving users access to commands that allow the user to run arbitrary
      commands. Many editors have a restricted mode where shell escapes are
      disabled, though <b>sudoedit</b> is a better solution to running editors
      via <b>sudo</b>. Due to the large number of programs that offer shell
      escapes, restricting users to the set of programs that do not is often
      unworkable.</dd>
  <dt id="noexec~2"><a class="permalink" href="#noexec~2">noexec</a></dt>
  <dd>Many systems that support shared libraries have the ability to override
      default library functions by pointing an environment variable (usually
      LD_PRELOAD) to an alternate shared library. On such systems, <b>sudo</b>'s
      <i>noexec</i> functionality can be used to prevent a program run by
      <b>sudo</b> from executing any other programs. Note, however, that this
      applies only to dynamically-linked executables. Statically-linked
      executables and executables running under binary emulation are not
      affected.
    <p class="Pp">The <i>noexec</i> feature is known to work on SunOS, Solaris,
        *BSD, Linux, IRIX, Tru64 UNIX, macOS, HP-UX 11.x and AIX 5.3 and above.
        It should be supported on most operating systems that support the
        LD_PRELOAD environment variable. Check your operating system's manual
        pages for the dynamic linker (usually ld.so, ld.so.1, dyld, dld.sl, rld,
        or loader) to see if LD_PRELOAD is supported.</p>
    <p class="Pp">On Solaris 10 and higher, <i>noexec</i> uses Solaris
        privileges instead of the LD_PRELOAD environment variable.</p>
    <p class="Pp">To enable <i>noexec</i> for a command, use the NOEXEC tag as
        documented in the User Specification section above. Here is that example
        again:</p>
    <pre>
    </pre>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>aaron	shanty = NOEXEC: /usr/bin/more, /usr/bin/vi</pre>
</div>
<pre></pre>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">This allows user <b>aaron</b> to run <i>/usr/bin/more</i> and
    <i>/usr/bin/vi</i> with <i>noexec</i> enabled. This will prevent those two
    commands from executing other commands (such as a shell). If you are unsure
    whether or not your system is capable of supporting <i>noexec</i> you can
    always just try it out and check whether shell escapes work when
    <i>noexec</i> is enabled.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Note that restricting shell escapes is not a panacea. Programs
    running as root are still capable of many potentially hazardous operations
    (such as changing or overwriting files) that could lead to unintended
    privilege escalation. In the specific case of an editor, a safer approach is
    to give the user permission to run <b>sudoedit</b> (see below).</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Secure_editing"><a class="permalink" href="#Secure_editing">Secure
  editing</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The <b>sudoers</b> plugin includes <b>sudoedit</b> support which
    allows users to securely edit files with the editor of their choice. As
    <b>sudoedit</b> is a built-in command, it must be specified in the
    <i>sudoers</i> file without a leading path. However, it may take command
    line arguments just as a normal command does. Wildcards used in
    <i>sudoedit</i> command line arguments are expected to be path names, so a
    forward slash (&#x2018;/&#x2019;) will not be matched by a wildcard.</p>
<p class="Pp">Unlike other <b>sudo</b> commands, the editor is run with the
    permissions of the invoking user and with the environment unmodified. More
    information may be found in the description of the <b>-e</b> option in
    sudo(8).</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, to allow user operator to edit the &#x201C;message of
    the day&#x201D; file:</p>
<pre>
</pre>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>operator	sudoedit /etc/motd</pre>
</div>
<pre></pre>
<p class="Pp">The operator user then runs <b>sudoedit</b> as follows:</p>
<pre>
</pre>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ sudoedit /etc/motd</pre>
</div>
<pre></pre>
<p class="Pp">The editor will run as the operator user, not root, on a temporary
    copy of <i>/etc/motd</i>. After the file has been edited, <i>/etc/motd</i>
    will be updated with the contents of the temporary copy.</p>
<p class="Pp">Users should <i>never</i> be granted <b>sudoedit</b> permission to
    edit a file that resides in a directory the user has write access to, either
    directly or via a wildcard. If the user has write access to the directory it
    is possible to replace the legitimate file with a link to another file,
    allowing the editing of arbitrary files. To prevent this, starting with
    version 1.8.16, symbolic links will not be followed in writable directories
    and <b>sudoedit</b> will refuse to edit a file located in a writable
    directory unless the <i>sudoedit_checkdir</i> option has been disabled or
    the invoking user is root. Additionally, in version 1.8.15 and higher,
    <b>sudoedit</b> will refuse to open a symbolic link unless either the
    <i>sudoedit_follow</i> option is enabled or the <i>sudoedit</i> command is
    prefixed with the FOLLOW tag in the <i>sudoers</i> file.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Time_stamp_file_checks"><a class="permalink" href="#Time_stamp_file_checks">Time
  stamp file checks</a></h2>
<p class="Pp"><b>sudoers</b> will check the ownership of its time stamp
    directory (<i>/var/db/sudo/ts</i> by default) and ignore the directory's
    contents if it is not owned by root or if it is writable by a user other
    than root. Older versions of <b>sudo</b> stored time stamp files in
    <i>/tmp</i>; this is no longer recommended as it may be possible for a user
    to create the time stamp themselves on systems that allow unprivileged users
    to change the ownership of files they create.</p>
<p class="Pp">While the time stamp directory <i>should</i> be cleared at reboot
    time, not all systems contain a <i>/run</i> or <i>/var/run</i> directory. To
    avoid potential problems, <b>sudoers</b> will ignore time stamp files that
    date from before the machine booted on systems where the boot time is
    available.</p>
<p class="Pp">Some systems with graphical desktop environments allow
    unprivileged users to change the system clock. Since <b>sudoers</b> relies
    on the system clock for time stamp validation, it may be possible on such
    systems for a user to run <b>sudo</b> for longer than
    <i>timestamp_timeout</i> by setting the clock back. To combat this,
    <b>sudoers</b> uses a monotonic clock (which never moves backwards) for its
    time stamps if the system supports it.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>sudoers</b> will not honor time stamps set far in the future.
    Time stamps with a date greater than current_time + 2 * TIMEOUT will be
    ignored and <b>sudoers</b> will log and complain.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the <i>timestamp_type</i> option is set to &#x201C;tty&#x201D;,
    the time stamp record includes the device number of the terminal the user
    authenticated with. This provides per-terminal granularity but time stamp
    records may still outlive the user's session.</p>
<p class="Pp">Unless the <i>timestamp_type</i> option is set to
    &#x201C;global&#x201D;, the time stamp record also includes the session ID
    of the process that last authenticated. This prevents processes in different
    terminal sessions from using the same time stamp record. On systems where a
    process's start time can be queried, the start time of the session leader is
    recorded in the time stamp record. If no terminal is present or the
    <i>timestamp_type</i> option is set to &#x201C;ppid&#x201D;, the start time
    of the parent process is used instead. In most cases this will prevent a
    time stamp record from being re-used without the user entering a password
    when logging out and back in again.</p>

<p class="Pp">Versions 1.8.4 and higher of the <b>sudoers</b> plugin support a

<p class="Pp">The priorities used by <b>sudoers</b>, in order of decreasing
    severity, are: <i>crit</i>, <i>err</i>, <i>warn</i>, <i>notice</i>,
    <i>diag</i>, <i>info</i>, <i>trace</i> and <i>debug</i>. Each priority, when
    specified, also includes all priorities higher than it. For example, a
    priority of <i>notice</i> would include debug messages logged at

<p class="Pp">The <i>sudoers</i> file should <b>always</b> be edited by the
    <b>visudo</b> utility which locks the file and checks for syntax errors. If
    <i>sudoers</i> contains syntax errors, <b>sudo</b> may refuse to run, which
    is a serious problem if <b>sudo</b> is your only method of obtaining
    superuser privileges. Recent versions of <b>sudoers</b> will attempt to
    recover after a syntax error by ignoring the rest of the line after
    encountering an error. Older versions of <b>sudo</b> will not run if
    <i>sudoers</i> contains a syntax error.</p>
<p class="Pp">When using netgroups of machines (as opposed to users), if you
