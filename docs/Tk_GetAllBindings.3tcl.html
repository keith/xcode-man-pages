   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

<p class="Pp">These procedures provide a general-purpose mechanism for creating
    and invoking bindings. Bindings are organized in terms of <i>binding
    tables</i>. A binding table consists of a collection of bindings plus a
    history of recent events. Within a binding table, bindings are associated
    with <i>objects</i>. The meaning of an object is defined by clients of the
    binding package. For example, Tk keeps uses one binding table to hold all of
    the bindings created by the <b>bind</b> command. For this table, objects are
    pointers to strings such as window names, class names, or other binding tags
    such as <b>all</b>. Tk also keeps a separate binding table for each canvas
    widget, which manages bindings created by the canvas's <b>bind</b> widget
    command; within this table, an object is either a pointer to the internal
    structure for a canvas item or a Tk_Uid identifying a tag.</p>
<p class="Pp">The procedure <b>Tk_CreateBindingTable</b> creates a new binding
    table and associates <i>interp</i> with it (when bindings in the table are
    invoked, the scripts will be evaluated in <i>interp</i>).
    <b>Tk_CreateBindingTable</b> returns a token for the table, which must be
    used in calls to other procedures such as <b>Tk_CreateBinding</b> or
    <b>Tk_BindEvent</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tk_DeleteBindingTable</b> frees all of the state associated
    with a binding table. Once it returns the caller should not use the
    <i>bindingTable</i> token again.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tk_CreateBinding</b> adds a new binding to an existing table.
    The <i>object</i> argument identifies the object with which the binding is
    to be associated, and it may be any one-word value. Typically it is a
    pointer to a string or data structure. The <i>eventString</i> argument
    identifies the event or sequence of events for the binding; see the
    documentation for the <b>bind</b> command for a description of its format.
    <i>script</i> is the Tcl script to be evaluated when the binding triggers.
    <i>append</i> indicates what to do if there already exists a binding for
    <i>object</i> and <i>eventString</i>: if <i>append</i> is zero then
    <i>script</i> replaces the old script; if <i>append</i> is non-zero then the
    new script is appended to the old one. <b>Tk_CreateBinding</b> returns an X
    event mask for all the events associated with the bindings. This information
    may be useful to invoke <b>XSelectInput</b> to select relevant events, or to
    disallow the use of certain events in bindings. If an error occurred while
    creating the binding (e.g., <i>eventString</i> refers to a non-existent
    event), then 0 is returned and an error message is left in
    <i>interp-&gt;result</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tk_DeleteBinding</b> removes from <i>bindingTable</i> the
    binding given by <i>object</i> and <i>eventString</i>, if such a binding
    exists. <b>Tk_DeleteBinding</b> always returns <b>TCL_OK</b>. In some cases
    it may reset <i>interp-&gt;result</i> to the default empty value.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tk_GetBinding</b> returns a pointer to the script associated
    with <i>eventString</i> and <i>object</i> in <i>bindingTable</i>. If no such
    binding exists then NULL is returned and an error message is left in
    <i>interp-&gt;result</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tk_GetAllBindings</b> returns in <i>interp-&gt;result</i> a
    list of all the event strings for which there are bindings in
    <i>bindingTable</i> associated with <i>object</i>. If there are no bindings
    for <i>object</i> then an empty string is returned in
    <i>interp-&gt;result</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tk_DeleteAllBindings</b> deletes all of the bindings in
    <i>bindingTable</i> that are associated with <i>object</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tk_BindEvent</b> is called to process an event. It makes a copy
    of the event in an internal history list associated with the binding table,
    then it checks for bindings that match the event. <b>Tk_BindEvent</b>
    processes each of the objects pointed to by <i>objectPtr</i> in turn. For
    each object, it finds all the bindings that match the current event history,
    selects the most specific binding using the priority mechanism described in
    the documentation for <b>bind</b>, and invokes the script for that binding.
    If there are no matching bindings for a particular object, then the object
    is skipped. <b>Tk_BindEvent</b> continues through all of the objects,
    handling exceptions such as errors, <b>break</b>, and <b>continue</b> as
    described in the documentation for <b>bind</b>.</p>
