<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">A (very) lightweight introduction in the use of the perl debugger,
    and a pointer to existing, deeper sources of information on the subject of
    debugging perl programs.</p>
<p class="Pp">There's an extraordinary number of people out there who don't
    appear to know anything about using the perl debugger, though they use the
    language every day. This is for them.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="use_strict"><a class="permalink" href="#use_strict">use
  strict</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">First of all, there's a few things you can do to make your life a
    lot more straightforward when it comes to debugging perl programs, without
    using the debugger at all. To demonstrate, here's a simple script, named
    &quot;hello&quot;, with a problem:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        #!/usr/bin/perl
        $var1 = 'Hello World'; # always wanted to do that :-)
        $var2 = &quot;$varl\n&quot;;
        print $var2; 
        exit;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">While this compiles and runs happily, it probably won't do what's
    expected, namely it doesn't print &quot;Hello World\n&quot; at all; It will
    on the other hand do exactly what it was told to do, computers being a bit
    that way inclined. That is, it will print out a newline character, and
    you'll get what looks like a blank line. It looks like there's 2 variables
    when (because of the typo) there's really 3:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        $var1 = 'Hello World';
        $varl = undef;
        $var2 = &quot;\n&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">To catch this kind of problem, we can force each variable to be
    declared before use by pulling in the strict module, by putting 'use
    strict;' after the first line of the script.</p>
<p class="Pp">Now when you run it, perl complains about the 3 undeclared
    variables and we get four error messages because one variable is referenced
    twice:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre> Global symbol &quot;$var1&quot; requires explicit package name at ./t1 line 4.
 Global symbol &quot;$var2&quot; requires explicit package name at ./t1 line 5.
 Global symbol &quot;$varl&quot; requires explicit package name at ./t1 line 5.
 Global symbol &quot;$var2&quot; requires explicit package name at ./t1 line 7.
 Execution of ./hello aborted due to compilation errors.
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Luvverly! and to fix this we declare all variables explicitly and
    now our script looks like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        #!/usr/bin/perl
        use strict;
        my $var1 = 'Hello World';
        my $varl = undef;
        my $var2 = &quot;$varl\n&quot;;
        print $var2; 
        exit;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">We then do (always a good idea) a syntax check before we try to
    run it again:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        &gt; perl -c hello
        hello syntax OK
</pre>
<p class="Pp">And now when we run it, we get &quot;\n&quot; still, but at least
    we know why. Just getting this script to compile has exposed the '$varl'
    (with the letter 'l') variable, and simply changing
    <span class="Li">$varl</span> to <span class="Li">$var1</span> solves the
    problem.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="Looking_at_data_and_"><a class="permalink" href="#Looking_at_data_and_">Looking
  at data and -w and v</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Ok, but how about when you want to really see your data, what's in
    that dynamic variable, just before using it?</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        #!/usr/bin/perl 
        use strict;
        my $key = 'welcome';
        my %data = (
                'this' =&gt; qw(that), 
                'tom' =&gt; qw(and jerry),
                'welcome' =&gt; q(Hello World),
                'zip' =&gt; q(welcome),
        );
        my @data = keys %data;
        print &quot;$data{$key}\n&quot;;
        exit;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Looks OK, after it's been through the syntax check (perl -c
    scriptname), we run it and all we get is a blank line again! Hmmmm.</p>
<p class="Pp">One common debugging approach here, would be to liberally sprinkle
    a few print statements, to add a check just before we print out our data,
    and another just after:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        print &quot;All OK\n&quot; if grep($key, keys %data);
        print &quot;$data{$key}\n&quot;;
        print &quot;done: '$data{$key}'\n&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">And try again:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        &gt; perl data
        All OK     
        done: ''
</pre>
<p class="Pp">After much staring at the same piece of code and not seeing the
    wood for the trees for some time, we get a cup of coffee and try another
    approach. That is, we bring in the cavalry by giving perl the '<b>-d</b>'
    switch on the command line:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        &gt; perl -d data 
        Default die handler restored.

        Enter h or `h h' for help, or `man perldebug' for more help.
        main::(./data:4):     my $key = 'welcome';
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Now, what we've done here is to launch the built-in perl debugger
    on our script. It's stopped at the first line of executable code and is
    waiting for input.</p>
<p class="Pp">Before we go any further, you'll want to know how to quit the
    debugger: use just the letter '<b>q</b>', not the words 'quit' or
  'exit':</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        DB&lt;1&gt; q
        &gt;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">That's it, you're back on home turf again.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="help"><a class="permalink" href="#help">help</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Fire the debugger up again on your script and we'll look at the
    help menu. There's a couple of ways of calling help: a simple '<b>h</b>'
    will get the summary help list, '<b>|h</b>' (pipe-h) will pipe the help
    through your pager (which is (probably 'more' or 'less'), and finally, '<b>h
    h</b>' (h-space-h) will give you the entire help screen. Here is the summary
    page:</p>

<p class="Pp">More confusing options than you can shake a big stick at! It's not
    as bad as it looks and it's very useful to know more about all of it, and
    fun too!</p>
<p class="Pp">There's a couple of useful ones to know about straight away. You
    wouldn't think we're using any libraries at all at the moment, but
    '<b>M</b>' will show which modules are currently loaded, and their version
    number, while '<b>m</b>' will show the methods, and '<b>S</b>' shows all
    subroutines (by pattern) as shown below. '<b>V</b>' and '<b>X</b>' show
    variables in the program by package scope and can be constrained by
  pattern.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        DB&lt;2&gt;S str 
        dumpvar::stringify
        strict::bits
        strict::import
        strict::unimport
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Using 'X' and cousins requires you not to use the type identifiers
    ($@%), just the 'name':</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        DM&lt;3&gt;X ~err
        FileHandle(stderr) =&gt; fileno(2)
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Remember we're in our tiny program with a problem, we should have
    a look at where we are, and what our data looks like. First of all let's
    view some code at our present position (the first line of code in this
    case), via '<b>v</b>':</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        DB&lt;4&gt; v
        1       #!/usr/bin/perl
        2:      use strict;
        3
        4==&gt;    my $key = 'welcome';
        5:      my %data = (
        6               'this' =&gt; qw(that),
        7               'tom' =&gt; qw(and jerry),
        8               'welcome' =&gt; q(Hello World),
        9               'zip' =&gt; q(welcome),
        10      );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">At line number 4 is a helpful pointer, that tells you where you
    are now. To see more code, type 'v' again:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        DB&lt;4&gt; v
        8               'welcome' =&gt; q(Hello World),
        9               'zip' =&gt; q(welcome),
        10      );
        11:     my @data = keys %data;
        12:     print &quot;All OK\n&quot; if grep($key, keys %data);
        13:     print &quot;$data{$key}\n&quot;;
        14:     print &quot;done: '$data{$key}'\n&quot;;
        15:     exit;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">And if you wanted to list line 5 again, type 'l 5', (note the
    space):</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        DB&lt;4&gt; l 5
        5:      my %data = (
</pre>
<p class="Pp">In this case, there's not much to see, but of course normally
    there's pages of stuff to wade through, and 'l' can be very useful. To reset
    your view to the line we're about to execute, type a lone period '.':</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        DB&lt;5&gt; .
        main::(./data_a:4):     my $key = 'welcome';
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The line shown is the one that is about to be executed
    <b>next</b>, it hasn't happened yet. So while we can print a variable with
    the letter '<b>p</b>', at this point all we'd get is an empty (undefined)
    value back. What we need to do is to step through the next executable
    statement with an '<b>s</b>':</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        DB&lt;6&gt; s
        main::(./data_a:5):     my %data = (
        main::(./data_a:6):             'this' =&gt; qw(that),
        main::(./data_a:7):             'tom' =&gt; qw(and jerry),
        main::(./data_a:8):             'welcome' =&gt; q(Hello World),
        main::(./data_a:9):             'zip' =&gt; q(welcome),
        main::(./data_a:10):    );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Now we can have a look at that first ($key) variable:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        DB&lt;7&gt; p $key 
        welcome
</pre>
<p class="Pp">line 13 is where the action is, so let's continue down to there
    via the letter '<b>c</b>', which by the way, inserts a 'one-time-only'
    breakpoint at the given line or sub routine:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        DB&lt;8&gt; c 13
        All OK
        main::(./data_a:13):    print &quot;$data{$key}\n&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">We've gone past our check (where 'All OK' was printed) and have
    stopped just before the meat of our task. We could try to print out a couple
    of variables to see what is happening:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        DB&lt;9&gt; p $data{$key}
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Not much in there, lets have a look at our hash:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        DB&lt;10&gt; p %data
        Hello Worldziptomandwelcomejerrywelcomethisthat 
        DB&lt;11&gt; p keys %data
        Hello Worldtomwelcomejerrythis
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Well, this isn't very easy to read, and using the helpful manual
    (<b>h h</b>), the '<b>x</b>' command looks promising:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        DB&lt;12&gt; x %data
        0  'Hello World'
        1  'zip'
        2  'tom'
        3  'and'
        4  'welcome'
        5  undef
        6  'jerry'
        7  'welcome'
        8  'this'
        9  'that'
</pre>
<p class="Pp">That's not much help, a couple of welcomes in there, but no
    indication of which are keys, and which are values, it's just a listed array
    dump and, in this case, not particularly helpful. The trick here, is to use
    a <b>reference</b> to the data structure:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        DB&lt;13&gt; x \%data
        0  HASH(0x8194bc4)
           'Hello World' =&gt; 'zip'
           'jerry' =&gt; 'welcome'
           'this' =&gt; 'that'
           'tom' =&gt; 'and'
           'welcome' =&gt; undef
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The reference is truly dumped and we can finally see what we're
    dealing with. Our quoting was perfectly valid but wrong for our purposes,
    with 'and jerry' being treated as 2 separate words rather than a phrase,
    thus throwing the evenly paired hash structure out of alignment.</p>
<p class="Pp">The '<b>-w</b>' switch would have told us about this, had we used
    it at the start, and saved us a lot of trouble:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        &gt; perl -w data
        Odd number of elements in hash assignment at ./data line 5.
</pre>
<p class="Pp">We fix our quoting: 'tom' =&gt; q(and jerry), and run it again,
    this time we get our expected output:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        &gt; perl -w data
        Hello World
</pre>
<p class="Pp">While we're here, take a closer look at the '<b>x</b>' command,
    it's really useful and will merrily dump out nested references, complete
    objects, partial objects - just about whatever you throw at it:</p>
<p class="Pp">Let's make a quick object and x-plode it, first we'll start the
    debugger: it wants some form of input from STDIN, so we give it something
    non-committal, a zero:</p>

        }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">For some reason, the Fahrenheit to Celsius conversion fails to
    return the expected output. This is what it does:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        &gt; temp -c0.72
        33.30 f
        &gt; temp -f33.3
        162.94 c
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Not very consistent! We'll set a breakpoint in the code manually
    and run it under the debugger to see what's going on. A breakpoint is a
    flag, to which the debugger will run without interruption, when it reaches
    the breakpoint, it will stop execution and offer a prompt for further
    interaction. In normal use, these debugger commands are completely ignored,
    and they are safe - if a little messy, to leave in production code.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        my ($in, $out) = ($num, $num);
        $DB::single=2; # insert at line 9!

        main::(temp:4): my $arg = $ARGV[0] || '-c100';
</pre>
<p class="Pp">We'll simply continue down to our pre-set breakpoint with a
    '<b>c</b>':</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        DB&lt;1&gt; c
        main::(temp:10):                if ($deg eq 'c') {
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Followed by a view command to see where we are:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        DB&lt;1&gt; v
        7:              my ($deg, $num) = ($1, $2);
        8:              my ($in, $out) = ($num, $num);
        9:              $DB::single=2;
        10==&gt;           if ($deg eq 'c') {
        11:                     $deg = 'f';
        12:                     $out = &amp;c2f($num);
        13              } else {
        14:                     $deg = 'c';
        15:                     $out = &amp;f2c($num);
        16              }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">And a print to show what values we're currently using:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        DB&lt;1&gt; p $deg, $num
        f33.3
</pre>
<p class="Pp">We can put another break point on any line beginning with a colon,
    we'll use line 17 as that's just as we come out of the subroutine, and we'd
    like to pause there later on:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        DB&lt;2&gt; b 17
</pre>
<p class="Pp">There's no feedback from this, but you can see what breakpoints
    are set by using the list 'L' command:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        DB&lt;3&gt; L
        temp:
                17:            print &quot;$out $deg\n&quot;;
                break if (1)
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Note that to delete a breakpoint you use 'B'.</p>
<p class="Pp">Now we'll continue down into our subroutine, this time rather than
    by line number, we'll use the subroutine name, followed by the now familiar
    'v':</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        DB&lt;3&gt; c f2c
        main::f2c(temp:30):             my $f = shift;  
        DB&lt;4&gt; v
        24:     exit;
        25
        26      sub f2c {
        27==&gt;           my $f = shift;
        28:             my $c = 5 * $f - 32 / 9; 
        29:             return $c;
        30      }
        31
        32      sub c2f {
        33:             my $c = shift;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Note that if there was a subroutine call between us and line 29,
    and we wanted to <b>single-step</b> through it, we could use the '<b>s</b>'
    command, and to step over it we would use '<b>n</b>' which would execute the
    sub, but not descend into it for inspection. In this case though, we simply
    continue down to line 29:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        DB&lt;4&gt; c 29  
        main::f2c(temp:29):             return $c;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">And have a look at the return value:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        DB&lt;5&gt; p $c
        162.944444444444
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This is not the right answer at all, but the sum looks correct. I
    wonder if it's anything to do with operator precedence? We'll try a couple
    of other possibilities with our sum:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        DB&lt;6&gt; p (5 * $f - 32 / 9)
        162.944444444444
        DB&lt;7&gt; p 5 * $f - (32 / 9) 
        162.944444444444
        DB&lt;8&gt; p (5 * $f) - 32 / 9
        162.944444444444
        DB&lt;9&gt; p 5 * ($f - 32) / 9
        0.722222222222221
</pre>
<p class="Pp">:-) that's more like it! Ok, now we can set our return variable
    and we'll return out of the sub with an 'r':</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        DB&lt;10&gt; $c = 5 * ($f - 32) / 9
        DB&lt;11&gt; r
        scalar context return from main::f2c: 0.722222222222221
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Looks good, let's just continue off the end of the script:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        DB&lt;12&gt; c
        0.72 c 
        Debugged program terminated.  Use q to quit or R to restart,
        use O inhibit_exit to avoid stopping after program termination,
        h q, h R or h O to get additional info.
</pre>
<p class="Pp">A quick fix to the offending line (insert the missing parentheses)
    in the actual program and we're finished.</p>

<p class="Pp">To get all the output from your error log, and not miss any
    messages via helpful operating system buffering, insert a line like this, at
    the start of your script:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        $|=1;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">To watch the tail of a dynamically growing logfile, (from the
    command line):</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        tail -f $error_log
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Wrapping all die calls in a handler routine can be useful to see
    how, and from where, they're being called, perlvar has more information:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        BEGIN { $SIG{__DIE__} = sub { require Carp; Carp::confess(@_) } }

<p class="Pp">The command line interface is tightly integrated with an
    <b>emacs</b> extension and there's a <b>vi</b> interface too.</p>
<p class="Pp">You don't have to do this all on the command line, though, there
    are a few GUI options out there. The nice thing about these is you can wave
    a mouse over a variable and a dump of its data will appear in an appropriate
    window, or in a popup balloon, no more tiresome typing of 'x
    <span class="Li">$varname</span>' :-)</p>
<p class="Pp">In particular have a hunt around for the following:</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>ptkdb</b> perlTK based wrapper for the built-in debugger</p>

<p class="Pp">We've seen how to encourage good coding practices with <b>use
    strict</b> and <b>-w</b>. We can run the perl debugger <b>perl -d
    scriptname</b> to inspect your data from within the perl debugger with the
    <b>p</b> and <b>x</b> commands. You can walk through your code, set
    breakpoints with <b>b</b> and step through that code with <b>s</b> or
    <b>n</b>, continue with <b>c</b> and return from a sub with <b>r</b>. Fairly
    intuitive stuff when you get down to it.</p>
<p class="Pp">There is of course lots more to find out about, this has just
    scratched the surface. The best way to learn more is to use perldoc to find
    out more about the language, to read the on-line help (perldebug is probably
    the next place to go), and of course, experiment.</p>
