   Set up some character translations and predefined strings.  \*(-- will
   give an unbreakable dash, \*(PI will give pi, \*(L" will give a left
   double quote, and \*(R" will give a right double quote.  \*(C+ will
   give a nicer C++.  Capital omega is used to do unbreakable dashes and
   therefore won't be available.  \*(C` and \*(C' expand to `' in nroff,
   nothing in troff, for use with C<>.

Due to the sheer size of its problem domain, DBIx::Class is a relatively complex
  framework. After you start using DBIx::Class questions will inevitably arise.

  # Connect to your database.

  my $schema = MyApp::Schema-&gt;connect($dbi_dsn, $user, $pass, \%dbi_params);

  # $artist here is a DBIx::Class::Row, which has accessors

  # This does not query the DB.

<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
This is an SQL to OO mapper with an object API inspired by Class::DBI (with a
  compatibility layer as a springboard for porting) and a resultset API that
  allows abstract encapsulation of database operations. It aims to make
  representing queries in your code as perl-ish as possible while still
  providing access to as many of the capabilities of the database as possible,
  including retrieving related records from multiple tables in a single query,
  <span class="Li">&quot;JOIN&quot;</span>, <span class="Li">&quot;LEFT
  JOIN&quot;</span>, <span class="Li">&quot;COUNT&quot;</span>,
  <span class="Li">&quot;DISTINCT&quot;</span>, <span class="Li">&quot;GROUP
  BY&quot;</span>, <span class="Li">&quot;ORDER BY&quot;</span> and
  <span class="Li">&quot;HAVING&quot;</span> support.
<p class="Pp">DBIx::Class can handle multi-column primary and foreign keys,
    complex queries and database-level paging, and does its best to only query
    the database in order to return something you've directly asked for. If a
    resultset is used as an iterator it only fetches rows off the statement
    handle as requested in order to minimise memory usage. It has auto-increment
    support for SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server and DB2 and is
    known to be used in production on at least the first four, and is fork- and
    thread-safe out of the box (although your DBD may not be).</p>
<p class="Pp">This project is still under rapid development, so large new
    features may be marked <b>experimental</b> - such APIs are still usable but
    may have edge bugs. Failing test cases are <i>always</i> welcome and point
    releases are put out rapidly as bugs are found and fixed.</p>
<p class="Pp">We do our best to maintain full backwards compatibility for
    published APIs, since DBIx::Class is used in production in many
    organisations, and even backwards incompatible changes to non-published APIs
    will be fixed if they're reported and doing so doesn't cost the codebase
    anything.</p>
<p class="Pp">The test suite is quite substantial, and several developer
    releases are generally made to CPAN before the branch for the next release
    is merged back to trunk for a major release.</p>

Even though a large portion of the source <i>appears</i> to be written by just a
  handful of people, this library continues to remain a collaborative effort -
  perhaps one of the most successful such projects on CPAN
  &lt;http://cpan.org&gt;. It is important to remember that ideas do not always
  result in a direct code contribution, but deserve acknowledgement just the
  same. Time and time again the seemingly most insignificant questions and
  suggestions have been shown to catalyze monumental improvements in
  consistency, accuracy and performance.
