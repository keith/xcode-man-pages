The <code class="Nm">services</code> file contains information regarding the
  known services available in the DARPA Internet. For each service a single line
  should be present with the following information:
<div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent">
<pre>
official service name
port number
protocol name
aliases
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Items are separated by any number of blanks and/or tab characters.
    The port number and protocol name are considered a single
    <i class="Em">item</i>; a ``/'' is used to separate the port and protocol
    (e.g. ``512/tcp''). A ``#'' indicates the beginning of a comment; subsequent
    characters up to the end of the line are not interpreted by the routines
    which search the file.</p>
<p class="Pp">Service names may contain any printable character other than a
    field delimiter, newline, or comment character.</p>

Processes generally find service records using one of the
  <a class="Xr">getservent(3)</a> family of functions, or using
  <a class="Xr">getaddrinfo(3)</a>. On Mac OS X, these functions interact with
  the <a class="Xr">DirectoryService(8)</a> daemon, which reads the
  /etc/services file as well as searching other directory information services
  to determine service name, protocol, and port information.
