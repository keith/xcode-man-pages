</section>

The <span class="Li">&quot;use warnings&quot;</span> pragma enables to control
  precisely what warnings are to be enabled in which parts of a Perl program.
  It's a more flexible alternative for both the command line flag <b>-w</b> and
  the equivalent Perl variable, <span class="Li">$^W</span>.
<p class="Pp">This pragma works just like the
    <span class="Li">&quot;strict&quot;</span> pragma. This means that the scope
    of the warning pragma is limited to the enclosing block. It also means that
    the pragma setting will not leak across files (via
    <span class="Li">&quot;use&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;require&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;do&quot;</span>). This allows authors to
    independently define the degree of warning checks that will be applied to
    their module.</p>
<p class="Pp">By default, optional warnings are disabled, so any legacy code
    that doesn't attempt to control the warnings will work unchanged.</p>
<p class="Pp">All warnings are enabled in a block by either of these:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    use warnings;
    use warnings 'all';
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Similarly all warnings are disabled in a block by either of
  these:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    no warnings;
    no warnings 'all';
</pre>
<p class="Pp">For example, consider the code below:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    use warnings;
    my @a;
    {
        no warnings;
        my $b = @a[0];
    }
    my $c = @a[0];
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The code in the enclosing block has warnings enabled, but the
    inner block has them disabled. In this case that means the assignment to the
    scalar <span class="Li">$c</span> will trip the
    <span class="Li">&quot;Scalar value @a[0] better written as
    $a[0]&quot;</span> warning, but the assignment to the scalar
    <span class="Li">$b</span> will not.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Default_Warnings_and_Optional_Warnings"><a class="permalink" href="#Default_Warnings_and_Optional_Warnings">Default
  Warnings and Optional Warnings</a></h2>
Before the introduction of lexical warnings, Perl had two classes of warnings:
  mandatory and optional.
<p class="Pp">As its name suggests, if your code tripped a mandatory warning,
    you would get a warning whether you wanted it or not. For example, the code
    below would always produce an <span class="Li">&quot;isn't
    numeric&quot;</span> warning about the &quot;2:&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    my $a = &quot;2:&quot; + 3;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">With the introduction of lexical warnings, mandatory warnings now
    become <i>default</i> warnings. The difference is that although the
    previously mandatory warnings are still enabled by default, they can then be
    subsequently enabled or disabled with the lexical warning pragma. For
    example, in the code below, an <span class="Li">&quot;isn't
    numeric&quot;</span> warning will only be reported for the
    <span class="Li">$a</span> variable.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    my $a = &quot;2:&quot; + 3;
    no warnings;
    my $b = &quot;2:&quot; + 3;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Note that neither the <b>-w</b> flag or the
    <span class="Li">$^W</span> can be used to disable/enable default warnings.
    They are still mandatory in this case.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="What's_wrong_with__fB_-w_fP_and_$_W"><a class="permalink" href="#What's_wrong_with__fB_-w_fP_and_$_W">What's
  wrong with <b>-w</b> and $^W</a></h2>
Although very useful, the big problem with using <b>-w</b> on the command line
  to enable warnings is that it is all or nothing. Take the typical scenario
  when you are writing a Perl program. Parts of the code you will write
  yourself, but it's very likely that you will make use of pre-written Perl
  modules. If you use the <b>-w</b> flag in this case, you end up enabling
  warnings in pieces of code that you haven't written.
<p class="Pp">Similarly, using <span class="Li">$^W</span> to either disable or
    enable blocks of code is fundamentally flawed. For a start, say you want to
    disable warnings in a block of code. You might expect this to be enough to
    do the trick:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
     {
         local ($^W) = 0;
         my $a =+ 2;
         my $b; chop $b;
     }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">When this code is run with the <b>-w</b> flag, a warning will be
    produced for the <span class="Li">$a</span> line:
    <span class="Li">&quot;Reversed += operator&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The problem is that Perl has both compile-time and run-time
    warnings. To disable compile-time warnings you need to rewrite the code like
    this:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
     {
         BEGIN { $^W = 0 }
         my $a =+ 2;
         my $b; chop $b;
     }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The other big problem with <span class="Li">$^W</span> is the way
    you can inadvertently change the warning setting in unexpected places in
    your code. For example, when the code below is run (without the <b>-w</b>
    flag), the second call to <span class="Li">&quot;doit&quot;</span> will trip
    a <span class="Li">&quot;Use of uninitialized value&quot;</span> warning,
    whereas the first will not.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    sub doit
    {
        my $b; chop $b;
    }

    doit();

    {
        local ($^W) = 1;
        doit()
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This is a side-effect of <span class="Li">$^W</span> being
    dynamically scoped.</p>
<p class="Pp">Lexical warnings get around these limitations by allowing finer
    control over where warnings can or can't be tripped.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Controlling_Warnings_from_the_Command_Line"><a class="permalink" href="#Controlling_Warnings_from_the_Command_Line">Controlling
  Warnings from the Command Line</a></h2>
There are three Command Line flags that can be used to control when warnings are
  (or aren't) produced:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>-w</b></dt>
  <dd>This is the existing flag. If the lexical warnings pragma is <b>not</b>
      used in any of you code, or any of the modules that you use, this flag
      will enable warnings everywhere. See &quot;Backward Compatibility&quot;
      for details of how this flag interacts with lexical warnings.</dd>
  <dt><b>-W</b></dt>
  <dd>If the <b>-W</b> flag is used on the command line, it will enable all
      warnings throughout the program regardless of whether warnings were
      disabled locally using <span class="Li">&quot;no warnings&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;$^W =0&quot;</span>. This includes all files that
      get included via <span class="Li">&quot;use&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;require&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;do&quot;</span>. Think of it as the Perl equivalent
      of the &quot;lint&quot; command.</dd>
  <dt><b>-X</b></dt>
  <dd>Does the exact opposite to the <b>-W</b> flag, i.e. it disables all
      warnings.</dd>
</dl>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Backward_Compatibility"><a class="permalink" href="#Backward_Compatibility">Backward
  Compatibility</a></h2>
If you are used to working with a version of Perl prior to the introduction of
  lexically scoped warnings, or have code that uses both lexical warnings and
  <span class="Li">$^W</span>, this section will describe how they interact.
<p class="Pp">How Lexical Warnings interact with
    <b>-w</b>/<span class="Li">$^W</span>:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>1.</dt>
  <dd>If none of the three command line flags (<b>-w</b>, <b>-W</b> or
      <b>-X</b>) that control warnings is used and neither
      <span class="Li">$^W</span> nor the
      <span class="Li">&quot;warnings&quot;</span> pragma are used, then default
      warnings will be enabled and optional warnings disabled. This means that
      legacy code that doesn't attempt to control the warnings will work
      unchanged.</dd>
  <dt>2.</dt>
  <dd>The <b>-w</b> flag just sets the global <span class="Li">$^W</span>
      variable as in 5.005. This means that any legacy code that currently
      relies on manipulating <span class="Li">$^W</span> to control warning
      behavior will still work as is.</dd>
  <dt>3.</dt>
  <dd>Apart from now being a boolean, the <span class="Li">$^W</span> variable
      operates in exactly the same horrible uncontrolled global way, except that
      it cannot disable/enable default warnings.</dd>
  <dt>4.</dt>
  <dd>If a piece of code is under the control of the
      <span class="Li">&quot;warnings&quot;</span> pragma, both the
      <span class="Li">$^W</span> variable and the <b>-w</b> flag will be
      ignored for the scope of the lexical warning.</dd>
  <dt>5.</dt>
  <dd>The only way to override a lexical warnings setting is with the <b>-W</b>
      or <b>-X</b> command line flags.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The combined effect of 3 &amp; 4 is that it will allow code which
    uses the <span class="Li">&quot;warnings&quot;</span> pragma to control the
    warning behavior of $^W-type code (using a <span class="Li">&quot;local
    $^W=0&quot;</span>) if it really wants to, but not vice-versa.</p>

The presence of the word &quot;FATAL&quot; in the category list will escalate
  any warnings detected from the categories specified in the lexical scope into
  fatal errors. In the code below, the use of
  <span class="Li">&quot;time&quot;</span>,
  <span class="Li">&quot;length&quot;</span> and
  <span class="Li">&quot;join&quot;</span> can all produce a

<p class="Pp">To explicitly turn off a &quot;FATAL&quot; warning you just
    disable the warning it is associated with. So, for example, to disable the
    &quot;void&quot; warning in the example above, either of these will do the

<p class="Pp">If you want to downgrade a warning that has been escalated into a

    deprecated, so code has been included to display a warning message whenever
    the calling module has (at least) the &quot;deprecated&quot; warnings
    category enabled. Something like this, say.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    use warnings 'deprecated';
    use MyMod::Abc;
    ...
    MyMod::Abc::open($filename);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Either the <span class="Li">&quot;warnings::warn&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;warnings::warnif&quot;</span> function should be used
    to actually display the warnings message. This is because they can make use
    of the feature that allows warnings to be escalated into fatal errors. So in
    this case</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    use MyMod::Abc;
    use warnings FATAL =&gt; 'MyMod::Abc';
    ...
    MyMod::Abc::open('../fred.txt');
</pre>
<p class="Pp">the <span class="Li">&quot;warnings::warnif&quot;</span> function
    will detect this and die after displaying the warning message.</p>
<p class="Pp">The three warnings functions,
    <span class="Li">&quot;warnings::warn&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;warnings::warnif&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;warnings::enabled&quot;</span> can optionally take an
    object reference in place of a category name. In this case the functions
    will use the class name of the object as the warnings category.</p>
<p class="Pp">Consider this example:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    package Original;

    no warnings;
    use warnings::register;

    sub new
    {
        my $class = shift;
        bless [], $class;
    }

    sub check
    {
        my $self = shift;
        my $value = shift;

        if ($value % 2 &amp;&amp; warnings::enabled($self))
          { warnings::warn($self, &quot;Odd numbers are unsafe&quot;) }
    }

    sub doit
    {
        my $self = shift;
        my $value = shift;
        $self-&gt;check($value);
        # ...
    }

    1;

    package Derived;

    use warnings::register;
    use Original;
    our @ISA = qw( Original );
    sub new
    {
        my $class = shift;
        bless [], $class;
    }


    1;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The code below makes use of both modules, but it only enables
    warnings from <span class="Li">&quot;Derived&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    use Original;
    use Derived;
    use warnings 'Derived';
    my $a = Original-&gt;new();
    $a-&gt;doit(1);
    my $b = Derived-&gt;new();
    $a-&gt;doit(1);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">When this code is run only the
    <span class="Li">&quot;Derived&quot;</span> object,
    <span class="Li">$b</span>, will generate a warning.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    Odd numbers are unsafe at main.pl line 7
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Notice also that the warning is reported at the line where the
    object is first used.</p>
<p class="Pp">When registering new categories of warning, you can supply more
    names to warnings::register like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    package MyModule;
    use warnings::register qw(format precision);

    ...

    warnings::warnif('MyModule::format', '...');
