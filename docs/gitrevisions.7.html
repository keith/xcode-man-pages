Many Git commands take revision parameters as arguments. Depending on the
  command, they denote a specific commit or, for commands which walk the
  revision graph (such as <b>git-log</b>(1)), all commits which are reachable
  from that commit. For commands that walk the revision graph one can also
  specify a range of revisions explicitly.
<p class="Pp">In addition, some Git commands (such as <b>git-show</b>(1) and
    <b>git-push</b>(1)) can also take revision parameters which denote other
    objects than commits, e.g. blobs (&quot;files&quot;) or trees
    (&quot;directories of files&quot;).</p>

  REVISIONS</a></h1>
A revision parameter <i>&lt;rev&gt;</i> typically, but not necessarily, names a
  commit object. It uses what is called an <i>extended SHA-1</i> syntax. Here
  are various ways to spell object names. The ones listed near the end of this
  list name trees and blobs contained in a commit.
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<br/>
<b>Note</b>
<p class="Pp">This document shows the &quot;raw&quot; syntax as seen by git. The
    shell and other UIs might require additional quoting to protect special
    characters and to avoid word splitting.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>&lt;sha1&gt;</i>, e.g.
    <i>dae86e1950b1277e545cee180551750029cfe735</i>, <i>dae86e</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The full SHA-1 object name (40-byte hexadecimal string),
  or a leading substring that is unique within the repository. E.g.
  dae86e1950b1277e545cee180551750029cfe735 and dae86e both name the same commit
  object if there is no other object in your repository whose object name starts
  with dae86e.</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>&lt;describeOutput&gt;</i>, e.g.
  <i>v1.7.4.2-679-g3bee7fb</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Output from <b>git describe</b>; i.e. a closest tag,
  optionally followed by a dash and a number of commits, followed by a dash, a
  <i>g</i>, and an abbreviated object name.</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>&lt;refname&gt;</i>, e.g. <i>master</i>, <i>heads/master</i>,
    <i>refs/heads/master</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A symbolic ref name. E.g. <i>master</i> typically means
  the commit object referenced by <i>refs/heads/master</i>. If you happen to
  have both <i>heads/master</i> and <i>tags/master</i>, you can explicitly say
  <i>heads/master</i> to tell Git which one you mean. When ambiguous, a
  <i>&lt;refname&gt;</i> is disambiguated by taking the first match in the
  following rules:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 1.If <i>$GIT_DIR/&lt;refname&gt;</i> exists, that is
  what you mean (this is usually useful only for <b>HEAD</b>, <b>FETCH_HEAD</b>,
  <b>ORIG_HEAD</b>, <b>MERGE_HEAD</b> and <b>CHERRY_PICK_HEAD</b>);</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 2.otherwise, <i>refs/&lt;refname&gt;</i> if it
  exists;</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 3.otherwise, <i>refs/tags/&lt;refname&gt;</i> if it
  exists;</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 4.otherwise, <i>refs/heads/&lt;refname&gt;</i> if it
  exists;</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 5.otherwise, <i>refs/remotes/&lt;refname&gt;</i> if it
  exists;</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 6.otherwise, <i>refs/remotes/&lt;refname&gt;/HEAD</i> if
  it exists.
<p class="Pp"><b>HEAD</b> names the commit on which you based the changes in the
    working tree. <b>FETCH_HEAD</b> records the branch which you fetched from a
    remote repository with your last <b>git fetch</b> invocation.
    <b>ORIG_HEAD</b> is created by commands that move your <b>HEAD</b> in a
    drastic way, to record the position of the <b>HEAD</b> before their
    operation, so that you can easily change the tip of the branch back to the
    state before you ran them. <b>MERGE_HEAD</b> records the commit(s) which you
    are merging into your branch when you run <b>git merge</b>.
    <b>CHERRY_PICK_HEAD</b> records the commit which you are cherry-picking when
    you run <b>git cherry-pick</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that any of the <i>refs/*</i> cases above may come either
    from the <b>$GIT_DIR/refs</b> directory or from the
    <b>$GIT_DIR/packed-refs</b> file. While the ref name encoding is
    unspecified, UTF-8 is preferred as some output processing may assume ref
    names in UTF-8.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>@</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"><i>@</i> alone is a shortcut for <b>HEAD</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>[&lt;refname&gt;]@{&lt;date&gt;}</i>, e.g.
    <i>master@{yesterday}</i>, <i>HEAD@{5 minutes ago}</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A ref followed by the suffix <i>@</i> with a date
  specification enclosed in a brace pair (e.g. <i>{yesterday}</i>, <i>{1 month 2
  weeks 3 days 1 hour 1 second ago}</i> or <i>{1979-02-26 18:30:00}</i>)
  specifies the value of the ref at a prior point in time. This suffix may only
  be used immediately following a ref name and the ref must have an existing log
  (<i>$GIT_DIR/logs/&lt;ref&gt;</i>). Note that this looks up the state of your
  <b>local</b> ref at a given time; e.g., what was in your local <i>master</i>
  branch last week. If you want to look at commits made during certain times,
  see <b>--since</b> and <b>--until</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>&lt;refname&gt;@{&lt;n&gt;}</i>, e.g. <i>master@{1}</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A ref followed by the suffix <i>@</i> with an ordinal
  specification enclosed in a brace pair (e.g. <i>{1}</i>, <i>{15}</i>)
  specifies the n-th prior value of that ref. For example <i>master@{1}</i> is
  the immediate prior value of <i>master</i> while <i>master@{5}</i> is the 5th
  prior value of <i>master</i>. This suffix may only be used immediately
  following a ref name and the ref must have an existing log
  (<i>$GIT_DIR/logs/&lt;refname&gt;</i>).</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>@{&lt;n&gt;}</i>, e.g. <i>@{1}</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">You can use the <i>@</i> construct with an empty ref part
  to get at a reflog entry of the current branch. For example, if you are on
  branch <i>blabla</i> then <i>@{1}</i> means the same as
  <i>blabla@{1}</i>.</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>@{-&lt;n&gt;}</i>, e.g. <i>@{-1}</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The construct <i>@{-&lt;n&gt;}</i> means the &lt;n&gt;th
  branch/commit checked out before the current one.</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>[&lt;branchname&gt;]@{upstream}</i>, e.g.
    <i>master@{upstream}</i>, <i>@{u}</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The suffix <i>@{upstream}</i> to a branchname (short form
  <i>&lt;branchname&gt;@{u}</i>) refers to the branch that the branch specified
  by branchname is set to build on top of (configured with
  <b>branch.&lt;name&gt;.remote</b> and <b>branch.&lt;name&gt;.merge</b>). A
  missing branchname defaults to the current one. These suffixes are also
  accepted when spelled in uppercase, and they mean the same thing no matter the
  case.</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>[&lt;branchname&gt;]@{push}</i>, e.g. <i>master@{push}</i>,
    <i>@{push}</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The suffix <i>@{push}</i> reports the branch &quot;where
  we would push to&quot; if <b>git push</b> were run while <b>branchname</b> was
  checked out (or the current <b>HEAD</b> if no branchname is specified). Since
  our push destination is in a remote repository, of course, we report the local
  tracking branch that corresponds to that branch (i.e., something in
  <b>refs/remotes/</b>).
<p class="Pp">Here&#x2019;s an example to make it more clear:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ git config push.default current
$ git config remote.pushdefault myfork
$ git switch -c mybranch origin/master
$ git rev-parse --symbolic-full-name @{upstream}
refs/remotes/origin/master
$ git rev-parse --symbolic-full-name @{push}
refs/remotes/myfork/mybranch
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Note in the example that we set up a triangular workflow, where we
    pull from one location and push to another. In a non-triangular workflow,
    <i>@{push}</i> is the same as <i>@{upstream}</i>, and there is no need for
    it.</p>
<p class="Pp">This suffix is also accepted when spelled in uppercase, and means
    the same thing no matter the case.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>&lt;rev&gt;^[&lt;n&gt;]</i>, e.g. <i>HEAD^, v1.5.1^0</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A suffix <i>^</i> to a revision parameter means the first
  parent of that commit object. <i>^&lt;n&gt;</i> means the &lt;n&gt;th parent
  (i.e. <i>&lt;rev&gt;^</i> is equivalent to <i>&lt;rev&gt;^1</i>). As a special
  rule, <i>&lt;rev&gt;^0</i> means the commit itself and is used when
  <i>&lt;rev&gt;</i> is the object name of a tag object that refers to a commit
  object.</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>&lt;rev&gt;~[&lt;n&gt;]</i>, e.g. <i>HEAD~, master~3</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A suffix <i>~</i> to a revision parameter means the first
  parent of that commit object. A suffix <i>~&lt;n&gt;</i> to a revision
  parameter means the commit object that is the &lt;n&gt;th generation ancestor
  of the named commit object, following only the first parents. I.e.
  <i>&lt;rev&gt;~3</i> is equivalent to <i>&lt;rev&gt;^^^</i> which is
  equivalent to <i>&lt;rev&gt;^1^1^1</i>. See below for an illustration of the
  usage of this form.</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>&lt;rev&gt;^{&lt;type&gt;}</i>, e.g.
  <i>v0.99.8^{commit}</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A suffix <i>^</i> followed by an object type name
  enclosed in brace pair means dereference the object at <i>&lt;rev&gt;</i>
  recursively until an object of type <i>&lt;type&gt;</i> is found or the object
  cannot be dereferenced anymore (in which case, barf). For example, if
  <i>&lt;rev&gt;</i> is a commit-ish, <i>&lt;rev&gt;^{commit}</i> describes the
  corresponding commit object. Similarly, if <i>&lt;rev&gt;</i> is a tree-ish,
  <i>&lt;rev&gt;^{tree}</i> describes the corresponding tree object.
  <i>&lt;rev&gt;^0</i> is a short-hand for <i>&lt;rev&gt;^{commit}</i>.
<p class="Pp"><i>&lt;rev&gt;^{object}</i> can be used to make sure
    <i>&lt;rev&gt;</i> names an object that exists, without requiring
    <i>&lt;rev&gt;</i> to be a tag, and without dereferencing
    <i>&lt;rev&gt;</i>; because a tag is already an object, it does not have to
    be dereferenced even once to get to an object.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>&lt;rev&gt;^{tag}</i> can be used to ensure that
    <i>&lt;rev&gt;</i> identifies an existing tag object.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>&lt;rev&gt;^{}</i>, e.g. <i>v0.99.8^{}</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A suffix <i>^</i> followed by an empty brace pair means
  the object could be a tag, and dereference the tag recursively until a non-tag
  object is found.</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>&lt;rev&gt;^{/&lt;text&gt;}</i>, e.g. <i>HEAD^{/fix nasty
    bug}</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A suffix <i>^</i> to a revision parameter, followed by a
  brace pair that contains a text led by a slash, is the same as the <i>:/fix
  nasty bug</i> syntax below except that it returns the youngest matching commit
  which is reachable from the <i>&lt;rev&gt;</i> before <i>^</i>.</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>:/&lt;text&gt;</i>, e.g. <i>:/fix nasty bug</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A colon, followed by a slash, followed by a text, names a
  commit whose commit message matches the specified regular expression. This
  name returns the youngest matching commit which is reachable from any ref,
  including HEAD. The regular expression can match any part of the commit
  message. To match messages starting with a string, one can use e.g.
  <i>:/^foo</i>. The special sequence <i>:/!</i> is reserved for modifiers to
  what is matched. <i>:/!-foo</i> performs a negative match, while
  <i>:/!!foo</i> matches a literal <i>!</i> character, followed by <i>foo</i>.
  Any other sequence beginning with <i>:/!</i> is reserved for now. Depending on
  the given text, the shell&#x2019;s word splitting rules might require
  additional quoting.</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>&lt;rev&gt;:&lt;path&gt;</i>, e.g. <i>HEAD:README</i>,
    <i>master:./README</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A suffix <i>:</i> followed by a path names the blob or
  tree at the given path in the tree-ish object named by the part before the
  colon. A path starting with <i>./</i> or <i>../</i> is relative to the current
  working directory. The given path will be converted to be relative to the
  working tree&#x2019;s root directory. This is most useful to address a blob or
  tree from a commit or tree that has the same tree structure as the working
  tree.</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>:[&lt;n&gt;:]&lt;path&gt;</i>, e.g. <i>:0:README</i>,
    <i>:README</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A colon, optionally followed by a stage number (0 to 3)
  and a colon, followed by a path, names a blob object in the index at the given
  path. A missing stage number (and the colon that follows it) names a stage 0
  entry. During a merge, stage 1 is the common ancestor, stage 2 is the target
  branch&#x2019;s version (typically the current branch), and stage 3 is the
  version from the branch which is being merged.</div>
<p class="Pp">Here is an illustration, by Jon Loeliger. Both commit nodes B and
    C are parents of commit node A. Parent commits are ordered
  left-to-right.</p>

  RANGES</a></h1>
History traversing commands such as <b>git log</b> operate on a set of commits,
  not just a single commit.
<p class="Pp">For these commands, specifying a single revision, using the
    notation described in the previous section, means the set of commits
    <b>reachable</b> from the given commit.</p>
<p class="Pp">A commit&#x2019;s reachable set is the commit itself and the
    commits in its ancestry chain.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Commit_Exclusions"><a class="permalink" href="#Commit_Exclusions">Commit
  Exclusions</a></h2>
<i>^&lt;rev&gt;</i> (caret) Notation
<div class="Bd-indent">To exclude commits reachable from a commit, a prefix
  <i>^</i> notation is used. E.g. <i>^r1 r2</i> means commits reachable from
  <i>r2</i> but exclude the ones reachable from <i>r1</i> (i.e. <i>r1</i> and
  its ancestors).</div>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Dotted_Range_Notations"><a class="permalink" href="#Dotted_Range_Notations">Dotted
  Range Notations</a></h2>
The <i>..</i> (two-dot) Range Notation
<div class="Bd-indent">The <i>^r1 r2</i> set operation appears so often that
  there is a shorthand for it. When you have two commits <i>r1</i> and <i>r2</i>
  (named according to the syntax explained in SPECIFYING REVISIONS above), you
  can ask for commits that are reachable from r2 excluding those that are
  reachable from r1 by <i>^r1 r2</i> and it can be written as
  <i>r1..r2</i>.</div>
<p class="Pp">The <i>...</i> (three-dot) Symmetric Difference Notation</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A similar notation <i>r1...r2</i> is called symmetric
  difference of <i>r1</i> and <i>r2</i> and is defined as <i>r1 r2 --not $(git
  merge-base --all r1 r2)</i>. It is the set of commits that are reachable from
  either one of <i>r1</i> (left side) or <i>r2</i> (right side) but not from
  both.</div>
<p class="Pp">In these two shorthand notations, you can omit one end and let it
    default to HEAD. For example, <i>origin..</i> is a shorthand for
    <i>origin..HEAD</i> and asks &quot;What did I do since I forked from the
    origin branch?&quot; Similarly, <i>..origin</i> is a shorthand for
    <i>HEAD..origin</i> and asks &quot;What did the origin do since I forked
    from them?&quot; Note that <i>..</i> would mean <i>HEAD..HEAD</i> which is
    an empty range that is both reachable and unreachable from HEAD.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Other__rev___Parent_Shorthand_Notations"><a class="permalink" href="#Other__rev___Parent_Shorthand_Notations">Other
  &lt;rev&gt;^ Parent Shorthand Notations</a></h2>
Three other shorthands exist, particularly useful for merge commits, for naming
  a set that is formed by a commit and its parent commits.
<p class="Pp">The <i>r1^@</i> notation means all parents of <i>r1</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>r1^!</i> notation includes commit <i>r1</i> but excludes
    all of its parents. By itself, this notation denotes the single commit
    <i>r1</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>&lt;rev&gt;^-[&lt;n&gt;]</i> notation includes
    <i>&lt;rev&gt;</i> but excludes the &lt;n&gt;th parent (i.e. a shorthand for
    <i>&lt;rev&gt;^&lt;n&gt;..&lt;rev&gt;</i>), with <i>&lt;n&gt;</i> = 1 if not
    given. This is typically useful for merge commits where you can just pass
    <i>&lt;commit&gt;^-</i> to get all the commits in the branch that was merged
    in merge commit <i>&lt;commit&gt;</i> (including <i>&lt;commit&gt;</i>
    itself).</p>
<p class="Pp">While <i>&lt;rev&gt;^&lt;n&gt;</i> was about specifying a single
    commit parent, these three notations also consider its parents. For example
    you can say <i>HEAD^2^@</i>, however you cannot say <i>HEAD^@^2</i>.</p>
