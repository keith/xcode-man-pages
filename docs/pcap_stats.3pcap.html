<p class="Pp"><b>pcap_stats</b>() fills in the <b>struct pcap_stat</b> pointed
    to by its second argument. The values represent packet statistics from the
    start of the run to the time of the call.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>pcap_stats</b>() is supported only on live captures, not on
    ``savefiles''; no statistics are stored in ``savefiles'', so no statistics
    are available when reading from a ``savefile''.</p>
<p class="Pp">A <b>struct pcap_stat</b> has the following members:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="ps_recv"><a class="permalink" href="#ps_recv"><b>ps_recv</b></a></dt>
  <dd>number of packets received;</dd>
  <dt id="ps_drop"><a class="permalink" href="#ps_drop"><b>ps_drop</b></a></dt>
  <dd>number of packets dropped because there was no room in the operating
      system's buffer when they arrived, because packets weren't being read fast
      enough;</dd>
  <dt id="ps_ifdrop"><a class="permalink" href="#ps_ifdrop"><b>ps_ifdrop</b></a></dt>
  <dd>number of packets dropped by the network interface or its driver.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The statistics do not behave the same way on all platforms.
    <b>ps_recv</b> might count packets whether they passed any filter set with
    <b>pcap_setfilter</b>(3PCAP) or not, or it might count only packets that
    pass the filter. It also might, or might not, count packets dropped because
    there was no room in the operating system's buffer when they arrived.
    <b>ps_drop</b> is not available on all platforms; it is zero on platforms
    where it's not available. If packet filtering is done in libpcap, rather
    than in the operating system, it would count packets that don't pass the
    filter. Both <b>ps_recv</b> and <b>ps_drop</b> might, or might not, count
    packets not yet read from the operating system and thus not yet seen by the
    application. <b>ps_ifdrop</b> might, or might not, be implemented; if it's
    zero, that might mean that no packets were dropped by the interface, or it
    might mean that the statistic is unavailable, so it should not be treated as
    an indication that the interface did not drop any packets.</p>

<p class="Pp"><b>pcap_stats</b>() returns <b>0</b> on success and returns

    statistics. If <b>PCAP_ERROR</b> is returned, <b>pcap_geterr</b>(3PCAP) or
    <b>pcap_perror</b>(3PCAP) may be called with <i>p</i> as an argument to
    fetch or display the error text.</p>
