   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

<h1 class="Sh" id="INTRODUCTION"><a class="permalink" href="#INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The interfaces described here are used to customize the Tcl event
    loop. The two most common customizations are to add new sources of events
    and to merge Tcl's event loop with some other event loop, such as one
    provided by an application in which Tcl is embedded. Each of these tasks is
    described in a separate section below.</p>
<p class="Pp">The procedures in this manual entry are the building blocks out of
    which the Tcl event notifier is constructed. The event notifier is the
    lowest layer in the Tcl event mechanism. It consists of three things:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>[1]</dt>
  <dd>Event sources: these represent the ways in which events can be generated.
      For example, there is a timer event source that implements the
      <b>Tcl_CreateTimerHandler</b> procedure and the <b>after</b> command, and
      there is a file event source that implements the
      <b>Tcl_CreateFileHandler</b> procedure on Unix systems. An event source
      must work with the notifier to detect events at the right times, record
      them on the event queue, and eventually notify higher-level software that
      they have occurred. The procedures <b>Tcl_CreateEventSource</b>,
      <b>Tcl_DeleteEventSource</b>, and <b>Tcl_SetMaxBlockTime</b>,
      <b>Tcl_QueueEvent</b>, and <b>Tcl_DeleteEvents</b> are used primarily by
      event sources.</dd>
  <dt>[2]</dt>
  <dd>The event queue: for non-threaded applications, there is a single queue
      for the whole application, containing events that have been detected but
      not yet serviced. Event sources place events onto the queue so that they
      may be processed in order at appropriate times during the event loop. The
      event queue guarantees a fair discipline of event handling, so that no
      event source can starve the others. It also allows events to be saved for
      servicing at a future time. Threaded applications work in a similar
      manner, except that there is a separate event queue for each thread
      containing a Tcl interpreter. <b>Tcl_QueueEvent</b> is used (primarily by
      event sources) to add events to the event queue and
      <b>Tcl_DeleteEvents</b> is used to remove events from the queue without
      processing them. In a threaded application, <b>Tcl_QueueEvent</b> adds an
      event to the current thread's queue, and <b>Tcl_ThreadQueueEvent</b> adds
      an event to a queue in a specific thread.</dd>
  <dt>[3]</dt>
  <dd>The event loop: in order to detect and process events, the application
      enters a loop that waits for events to occur, places them on the event
      queue, and then processes them. Most applications will do this by calling
      the procedure <b>Tcl_DoOneEvent</b>, which is described in a separate
      manual entry.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Most Tcl applications need not worry about any of the internals of
    the Tcl notifier. However, the notifier now has enough flexibility to be
    retargeted either for a new platform or to use an external event loop (such
    as the Motif event loop, when Tcl is embedded in a Motif application). The
    procedures <b>Tcl_WaitForEvent</b> and <b>Tcl_SetTimer</b> are normally
    implemented by Tcl, but may be replaced with new versions to retarget the
    notifier (the <b>Tcl_InitNotifier</b>, <b>Tcl_AlertNotifier</b>,
    <b>Tcl_FinalizeNotifier</b>, <b>Tcl_Sleep</b>, <b>Tcl_CreateFileHandler</b>,
    and <b>Tcl_DeleteFileHandler</b> must also be replaced; see CREATING A NEW
    NOTIFIER below for details). The procedures <b>Tcl_ServiceAll</b>,
    <b>Tcl_ServiceEvent</b>, <b>Tcl_GetServiceMode</b>, and
    <b>Tcl_SetServiceMode</b> are provided to help connect Tcl's event loop to
    an external event loop such as Motif's.</p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="NOTIFIER_BASICS"><a class="permalink" href="#NOTIFIER_BASICS">NOTIFIER
  BASICS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The easiest way to understand how the notifier works is to
    consider what happens when <b>Tcl_DoOneEvent</b> is called.
    <b>Tcl_DoOneEvent</b> is passed a <i>flags</i> argument that indicates what
    sort of events it is OK to process and also whether or not to block if no
    events are ready. <b>Tcl_DoOneEvent</b> does the following things:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>[1]</dt>
  <dd>Check the event queue to see if it contains any events that can be
      serviced. If so, service the first possible event, remove it from the
      queue, and return. It does this by calling <b>Tcl_ServiceEvent</b> and
      passing in the <i>flags</i> argument.</dd>
  <dt>[2]</dt>
  <dd>Prepare to block for an event. To do this, <b>Tcl_DoOneEvent</b> invokes a
      <i>setup procedure</i> in each event source. The event source will perform
      event-source specific initialization and possibly call
      <b>Tcl_SetMaxBlockTime</b> to limit how long <b>Tcl_WaitForEvent</b> will
      block if no new events occur.</dd>
  <dt>[3]</dt>
  <dd>Call <b>Tcl_WaitForEvent</b>. This procedure is implemented differently on
      different platforms; it waits for an event to occur, based on the
      information provided by the event sources. It may cause the application to
      block if <i>timePtr</i> specifies an interval other than 0.
      <b>Tcl_WaitForEvent</b> returns when something has happened, such as a
      file becoming readable or the interval given by <i>timePtr</i> expiring.
      If there are no events for <b>Tcl_WaitForEvent</b> to wait for, so that it
      would block forever, then it returns immediately and <b>Tcl_DoOneEvent</b>
      returns 0.</dd>
  <dt>[4]</dt>
  <dd>Call a <i>check procedure</i> in each event source. The check procedure
      determines whether any events of interest to this source occurred. If so,
      the events are added to the event queue.</dd>
  <dt>[5]</dt>
  <dd>Check the event queue to see if it contains any events that can be
      serviced. If so, service the first possible event, remove it from the
      queue, and return.</dd>
  <dt>[6]</dt>
  <dd>See if there are idle callbacks pending. If so, invoke all of them and
      return.</dd>
  <dt>[7]</dt>
  <dd>Either return 0 to indicate that no events were ready, or go back to step
      [2] if blocking was requested by the caller.
    <p class="Pp"></p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="CREATING_A_NEW_EVENT_SOURCE"><a class="permalink" href="#CREATING_A_NEW_EVENT_SOURCE">CREATING
  A NEW EVENT SOURCE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">An event source consists of three procedures invoked by the
    notifier, plus additional C procedures that are invoked by higher-level code
    to arrange for event-driven callbacks. The three procedures called by the
    notifier consist of the setup and check procedures described above, plus an
    additional procedure that is invoked when an event is removed from the event
    queue for servicing.</p>
<p class="Pp">The procedure <b>Tcl_CreateEventSource</b> creates a new event
    source. Its arguments specify the setup procedure and check procedure for
    the event source. <i>SetupProc</i> should match the following prototype:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
typedef void Tcl_EventSetupProc(
<br/>
        ClientData <i>clientData</i>,
<br/>
        int <i>flags</i>);</pre>
</div>
The <i>clientData</i> argument will be the same as the <i>clientData</i>
  argument to <b>Tcl_CreateEventSource</b>; it is typically used to point to
  private information managed by the event source. The <i>flags</i> argument
  will be the same as the <i>flags</i> argument passed to <b>Tcl_DoOneEvent</b>
  except that it will never be 0 (<b>Tcl_DoOneEvent</b> replaces 0 with
  <b>TCL_ALL_EVENTS</b>). <i>Flags</i> indicates what kinds of events should be
  considered; if the bit corresponding to this event source is not set, the
  event source should return immediately without doing anything. For example,
  the file event source checks for the <b>TCL_FILE_EVENTS</b> bit.
<p class="Pp"><i>SetupProc</i>'s job is to make sure that the application wakes
    up when events of the desired type occur. This is typically done in a
    platform-dependent fashion. For example, under Unix an event source might
    call <b>Tcl_CreateFileHandler</b>; under Windows it might request
    notification with a Windows event. For timer-driven event sources such as
    timer events or any polled event, the event source can call
    <b>Tcl_SetMaxBlockTime</b> to force the application to wake up after a
    specified time even if no events have occurred. If no event source calls
    <b>Tcl_SetMaxBlockTime</b> then <b>Tcl_WaitForEvent</b> will wait as long as
    necessary for an event to occur; otherwise, it will only wait as long as the
    shortest interval passed to <b>Tcl_SetMaxBlockTime</b> by one of the event
    sources. If an event source knows that it already has events ready to
    report, it can request a zero maximum block time. For example, the setup
    procedure for the X event source looks to see if there are events already
    queued. If there are, it calls <b>Tcl_SetMaxBlockTime</b> with a 0 block
    time so that <b>Tcl_WaitForEvent</b> does not block if there is no new data
    on the X connection. The <i>timePtr</i> argument to <b>Tcl_WaitForEvent</b>
    points to a structure that describes a time interval in seconds and
    microseconds:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
typedef struct Tcl_Time {
<br/>
        long <i>sec</i>;
<br/>
        long <i>usec</i>;
} Tcl_Time;</pre>
</div>
The <i>usec</i> field should be less than 1000000.
<p class="Pp">Information provided to <b>Tcl_SetMaxBlockTime</b> is only used
    for the next call to <b>Tcl_WaitForEvent</b>; it is discarded after
    <b>Tcl_WaitForEvent</b> returns. The next time an event wait is done each of
    the event sources' setup procedures will be called again, and they can
    specify new information for that event wait.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the application uses an external event loop rather than
    <b>Tcl_DoOneEvent</b>, the event sources may need to call
    <b>Tcl_SetMaxBlockTime</b> at other times. For example, if a new event
    handler is registered that needs to poll for events, the event source may
    call <b>Tcl_SetMaxBlockTime</b> to set the block time to zero to force the
    external event loop to call Tcl. In this case, <b>Tcl_SetMaxBlockTime</b>
    invokes <b>Tcl_SetTimer</b> with the shortest interval seen since the last
    call to <b>Tcl_DoOneEvent</b> or <b>Tcl_ServiceAll</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">In addition to the generic procedure <b>Tcl_SetMaxBlockTime</b>,
    other platform-specific procedures may also be available for
    <i>setupProc</i>, if there is additional information needed by
    <b>Tcl_WaitForEvent</b> on that platform. For example, on Unix systems the
    <b>Tcl_CreateFileHandler</b> interface can be used to wait for file
  events.</p>
<p class="Pp">The second procedure provided by each event source is its check
    procedure, indicated by the <i>checkProc</i> argument to
    <b>Tcl_CreateEventSource</b>. <i>CheckProc</i> must match the following
    prototype:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
typedef void Tcl_EventCheckProc(
<br/>
        ClientData <i>clientData</i>,
<br/>
        int <i>flags</i>);</pre>
</div>
The arguments to this procedure are the same as those for <i>setupProc</i>.
  <b>CheckProc</b> is invoked by <b>Tcl_DoOneEvent</b> after it has waited for
  events. Presumably at least one event source is now prepared to queue an
  event. <b>Tcl_DoOneEvent</b> calls each of the event sources in turn, so they
  all have a chance to queue any events that are ready. The check procedure does
  two things. First, it must see if any events have triggered. Different event
  sources do this in different ways.
<p class="Pp">If an event source's check procedure detects an interesting event,
    it must add the event to Tcl's event queue. To do this, the event source
    calls <b>Tcl_QueueEvent</b>. The <i>evPtr</i> argument is a pointer to a
    dynamically allocated structure containing the event (see below for more
    information on memory management issues). Each event source can define its
    own event structure with whatever information is relevant to that event
    source. However, the first element of the structure must be a structure of
    type <b>Tcl_Event</b>, and the address of this structure is used when
    communicating between the event source and the rest of the notifier. A
    <b>Tcl_Event</b> has the following definition:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
typedef struct {
<br/>
    Tcl_EventProc *<i>proc</i>;
<br/>
    struct Tcl_Event *<i>nextPtr</i>;
} Tcl_Event;</pre>
</div>
The event source must fill in the <i>proc</i> field of the event before calling
  <b>Tcl_QueueEvent</b>. The <i>nextPtr</i> is used to link together the events
  in the queue and should not be modified by the event source.
<p class="Pp">An event may be added to the queue at any of three positions,
    depending on the <i>position</i> argument to <b>Tcl_QueueEvent</b>:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="TCL_QUEUE_TAIL"><a class="permalink" href="#TCL_QUEUE_TAIL"><b>TCL_QUEUE_TAIL</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Add the event at the back of the queue, so that all other pending events
      will be serviced first. This is almost always the right place for new
      events.</dd>
  <dt id="TCL_QUEUE_HEAD"><a class="permalink" href="#TCL_QUEUE_HEAD"><b>TCL_QUEUE_HEAD</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Add the event at the front of the queue, so that it will be serviced
      before all other queued events.</dd>
  <dt id="TCL_QUEUE_MARK"><a class="permalink" href="#TCL_QUEUE_MARK"><b>TCL_QUEUE_MARK</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Add the event at the front of the queue, unless there are other events at
      the front whose position is <b>TCL_QUEUE_MARK</b>; if so, add the new
      event just after all other <b>TCL_QUEUE_MARK</b> events. This value of
      <i>position</i> is used to insert an ordered sequence of events at the
      front of the queue, such as a series of Enter and Leave events synthesized
      during a grab or ungrab operation in Tk.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">When it is time to handle an event from the queue (steps 1 and 4
    above) <b>Tcl_ServiceEvent</b> will invoke the <i>proc</i> specified in the
    first queued <b>Tcl_Event</b> structure. <i>Proc</i> must match the
    following prototype:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
typedef int Tcl_EventProc(
<br/>
        Tcl_Event *<i>evPtr</i>,
<br/>
        int <i>flags</i>);</pre>
</div>
The first argument to <i>proc</i> is a pointer to the event, which will be the
  same as the first argument to the <b>Tcl_QueueEvent</b> call that added the
  event to the queue. The second argument to <i>proc</i> is the <i>flags</i>
  argument for the current call to <b>Tcl_ServiceEvent</b>; this is used by the
  event source to return immediately if its events are not relevant.
<p class="Pp">It is up to <i>proc</i> to handle the event, typically by invoking
    one or more Tcl commands or C-level callbacks. Once the event source has
    finished handling the event it returns 1 to indicate that the event can be
    removed from the queue. If for some reason the event source decides that the
    event cannot be handled at this time, it may return 0 to indicate that the
    event should be deferred for processing later; in this case
    <b>Tcl_ServiceEvent</b> will go on to the next event in the queue and
    attempt to service it. There are several reasons why an event source might
    defer an event. One possibility is that events of this type are excluded by
    the <i>flags</i> argument. For example, the file event source will always
    return 0 if the <b>TCL_FILE_EVENTS</b> bit is not set in <i>flags</i>.
    Another example of deferring events happens in Tk if
    <b>Tk_RestrictEvents</b> has been invoked to defer certain kinds of window
    events.</p>
<p class="Pp">When <i>proc</i> returns 1, <b>Tcl_ServiceEvent</b> will remove
    the event from the event queue and free its storage. Note that the storage
    for an event must be allocated by the event source (using <b>Tcl_Alloc</b>
    or the Tcl macro <b>ckalloc</b>) before calling <b>Tcl_QueueEvent</b>, but
    it will be freed by <b>Tcl_ServiceEvent</b>, not by the event source.</p>
<p class="Pp">Threaded applications work in a similar manner, except that there
    is a separate event queue for each thread containing a Tcl interpreter.
    Calling <b>Tcl_QueueEvent</b> in a multithreaded application adds an event
    to the current thread's queue. To add an event to another thread's queue,
    use <b>Tcl_ThreadQueueEvent</b>. <b>Tcl_ThreadQueueEvent</b> accepts as an
    argument a Tcl_ThreadId argument, which uniquely identifies a thread in a
    Tcl application. To obtain the Tcl_ThreadID for the current thread, use the
    <b>Tcl_GetCurrentThread</b> procedure. (A thread would then need to pass
    this identifier to other threads for those threads to be able to add events
    to its queue.) After adding an event to another thread's queue, you then
    typically need to call <b>Tcl_ThreadAlert</b> to &#x201C;wake up&#x201D;
    that thread's notifier to alert it to the new event.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_DeleteEvents</b> can be used to explicitly remove one or
    more events from the event queue. <b>Tcl_DeleteEvents</b> calls <i>proc</i>
    for each event in the queue, deleting those for with the procedure returns
    1. Events for which the procedure returns 0 are left in the queue.
    <i>Proc</i> should match the following prototype:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
typedef int Tcl_EventDeleteProc(
<br/>
        Tcl_Event *<i>evPtr</i>,
<br/>
        ClientData <i>clientData</i>);</pre>
</div>
The <i>clientData</i> argument will be the same as the <i>clientData</i>
  argument to <b>Tcl_DeleteEvents</b>; it is typically used to point to private
  information managed by the event source. The <i>evPtr</i> will point to the
  next event in the queue.
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_DeleteEventSource</b> deletes an event source. The
    <i>setupProc</i>, <i>checkProc</i>, and <i>clientData</i> arguments must
    exactly match those provided to the <b>Tcl_CreateEventSource</b> for the
    event source to be deleted. If no such source exists,
    <b>Tcl_DeleteEventSource</b> has no effect.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="CREATING_A_NEW_NOTIFIER"><a class="permalink" href="#CREATING_A_NEW_NOTIFIER">CREATING
  A NEW NOTIFIER</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The notifier consists of all the procedures described in this
    manual entry, plus <b>Tcl_DoOneEvent</b> and <b>Tcl_Sleep</b>, which are
    available on all platforms, and <b>Tcl_CreateFileHandler</b> and
    <b>Tcl_DeleteFileHandler</b>, which are Unix-specific. Most of these
    procedures are generic, in that they are the same for all notifiers.
    However, none of the procedures are notifier-dependent:
    <b>Tcl_InitNotifier</b>, <b>Tcl_AlertNotifier</b>,
    <b>Tcl_FinalizeNotifier</b>, <b>Tcl_SetTimer</b>, <b>Tcl_Sleep</b>,
    <b>Tcl_WaitForEvent</b>, <b>Tcl_CreateFileHandler</b>,
    <b>Tcl_DeleteFileHandler</b> and <b>Tcl_ServiceModeHook</b>. To support a
    new platform or to integrate Tcl with an application-specific event loop,
    you must write new versions of these procedures.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_InitNotifier</b> initializes the notifier state and returns
    a handle to the notifier state. Tcl calls this procedure when initializing a
    Tcl interpreter. Similarly, <b>Tcl_FinalizeNotifier</b> shuts down the
    notifier, and is called by <b>Tcl_Finalize</b> when shutting down a Tcl
    interpreter.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_WaitForEvent</b> is the lowest-level procedure in the
    notifier; it is responsible for waiting for an &#x201C;interesting&#x201D;
    event to occur or for a given time to elapse. Before <b>Tcl_WaitForEvent</b>
    is invoked, each of the event sources' setup procedure will have been
    invoked. The <i>timePtr</i> argument to <b>Tcl_WaitForEvent</b> gives the
    maximum time to block for an event, based on calls to
    <b>Tcl_SetMaxBlockTime</b> made by setup procedures and on other information
    (such as the <b>TCL_DONT_WAIT</b> bit in <i>flags</i>).</p>
<p class="Pp">Ideally, <b>Tcl_WaitForEvent</b> should only wait for an event to
    occur; it should not actually process the event in any way. Later on, the
    event sources will process the raw events and create Tcl_Events on the event
    queue in their <i>checkProc</i> procedures. However, on some platforms (such
    as Windows) this is not possible; events may be processed in
    <b>Tcl_WaitForEvent</b>, including queuing Tcl_Events and more (for example,
    callbacks for native widgets may be invoked). The return value from
    <b>Tcl_WaitForEvent</b> must be either 0, 1, or -1. On platforms such as
    Windows where events get processed in <b>Tcl_WaitForEvent</b>, a return
    value of 1 means that there may be more events still pending that have not
    been processed. This is a sign to the caller that it must call
    <b>Tcl_WaitForEvent</b> again if it wants all pending events to be
    processed. A 0 return value means that calling <b>Tcl_WaitForEvent</b> again
    will not have any effect: either this is a platform where
    <b>Tcl_WaitForEvent</b> only waits without doing any event processing, or
    <b>Tcl_WaitForEvent</b> knows for sure that there are no additional events
    to process (e.g. it returned because the time elapsed). Finally, a return
    value of -1 means that the event loop is no longer operational and the
    application should probably unwind and terminate. Under Windows this happens
    when a WM_QUIT message is received; under Unix it happens when
    <b>Tcl_WaitForEvent</b> would have waited forever because there were no
    active event sources and the timeout was infinite.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_AlertNotifier</b> is used in multithreaded applications to
    allow any thread to &#x201C;wake up&#x201D; the notifier to alert it to new
    events on its queue. <b>Tcl_AlertNotifier</b> requires as an argument the
    notifier handle returned by <b>Tcl_InitNotifier</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the notifier will be used with an external event loop, then it
    must also support the <b>Tcl_SetTimer</b> interface. <b>Tcl_SetTimer</b> is
    invoked by <b>Tcl_SetMaxBlockTime</b> whenever the maximum blocking time has
    been reduced. <b>Tcl_SetTimer</b> should arrange for the external event loop
    to invoke <b>Tcl_ServiceAll</b> after the specified interval even if no
    events have occurred. This interface is needed because
    <b>Tcl_WaitForEvent</b> is not invoked when there is an external event loop.
    If the notifier will only be used from <b>Tcl_DoOneEvent</b>, then
    <b>Tcl_SetTimer</b> need not do anything.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_ServiceModeHook</b> is called by the platform-independent
    portion of the notifier when client code makes a call to
    <b>Tcl_SetServiceMode</b>. This hook is provided to support operating
    systems that require special event handling when the application is in a
    modal loop (the Windows notifier, for instance, uses this hook to create a
    communication window).</p>
<p class="Pp">On Unix systems, the file event source also needs support from the
    notifier. The file event source consists of the <b>Tcl_CreateFileHandler</b>
    and <b>Tcl_DeleteFileHandler</b> procedures, which are described in the
    <b>Tcl_CreateFileHandler</b> manual page.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>Tcl_Sleep</b> and <b>Tcl_DoOneEvent</b> interfaces are
    described in their respective manual pages.</p>
<p class="Pp">The easiest way to create a new notifier is to look at the code
    for an existing notifier, such as the files <b>unix/tclUnixNotfy.c</b> or
    <b>win/tclWinNotify.c</b> in the Tcl source distribution.</p>

  THE NOTIFIER</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">A notifier that has been written according to the conventions
    above can also be installed in a running process in place of the standard
    notifier. This mechanism is used so that a single executable can be used
    (with the standard notifier) as a stand-alone program and reused (with a
    replacement notifier in a loadable extension) as an extension to another
    program, such as a Web browser plugin.</p>
<p class="Pp">To do this, the extension makes a call to <b>Tcl_SetNotifier</b>
    passing a pointer to a <b>Tcl_NotifierProcs</b> data structure. The
    structure has the following layout:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
typedef struct Tcl_NotifierProcs {
<br/>
    Tcl_SetTimerProc *setTimerProc;
<br/>
    Tcl_WaitForEventProc *waitForEventProc;
<br/>
    Tcl_CreateFileHandlerProc *createFileHandlerProc;
<br/>
    Tcl_DeleteFileHandlerProc *deleteFileHandlerProc;
<br/>
    Tcl_InitNotifierProc *initNotifierProc;
<br/>
    Tcl_FinalizeNotifierProc *finalizeNotifierProc;
<br/>
    Tcl_AlertNotifierProc *alertNotifierProc;
<br/>
    Tcl_ServiceModeHookProc *serviceModeHookProc;
} Tcl_NotifierProcs;</pre>
</div>
Following the call to <b>Tcl_SetNotifier</b>, the pointers given in the
  <b>Tcl_NotifierProcs</b> structure replace whatever notifier had been
  installed in the process.
<p class="Pp">It is extraordinarily unwise to replace a running notifier.
    Normally, <b>Tcl_SetNotifier</b> should be called at process initialization
    time before the first call to <b>Tcl_InitNotifier</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="EXTERNAL_EVENT_LOOPS"><a class="permalink" href="#EXTERNAL_EVENT_LOOPS">EXTERNAL
  EVENT LOOPS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The notifier interfaces are designed so that Tcl can be embedded
    into applications that have their own private event loops. In this case, the
    application does not call <b>Tcl_DoOneEvent</b> except in the case of
    recursive event loops such as calls to the Tcl commands <b>update</b> or
    <b>vwait</b>. Most of the time is spent in the external event loop of the
    application. In this case the notifier must arrange for the external event
    loop to call back into Tcl when something happens on the various Tcl event
    sources. These callbacks should arrange for appropriate Tcl events to be
    placed on the Tcl event queue.</p>
<p class="Pp">Because the external event loop is not calling
    <b>Tcl_DoOneEvent</b> on a regular basis, it is up to the notifier to
    arrange for <b>Tcl_ServiceEvent</b> to be called whenever events are pending
    on the Tcl event queue. The easiest way to do this is to invoke
    <b>Tcl_ServiceAll</b> at the end of each callback from the external event
    loop. This will ensure that all of the event sources are polled, any queued
    events are serviced, and any pending idle handlers are processed before
    returning control to the application. In addition, event sources that need
    to poll for events can call <b>Tcl_SetMaxBlockTime</b> to force the external
    event loop to call Tcl even if no events are available on the system event
    queue.</p>
<p class="Pp">As a side effect of processing events detected in the main
    external event loop, Tcl may invoke <b>Tcl_DoOneEvent</b> to start a
    recursive event loop in commands like <b>vwait</b>. <b>Tcl_DoOneEvent</b>
    will invoke the external event loop, which will result in callbacks as
    described in the preceding paragraph, which will result in calls to
    <b>Tcl_ServiceAll</b>. However, in these cases it is undesirable to service
    events in <b>Tcl_ServiceAll</b>. Servicing events there is unnecessary
    because control will immediately return to the external event loop and hence
    to <b>Tcl_DoOneEvent</b>, which can service the events itself. Furthermore,
    <b>Tcl_DoOneEvent</b> is supposed to service only a single event, whereas
    <b>Tcl_ServiceAll</b> normally services all pending events. To handle this
    situation, <b>Tcl_DoOneEvent</b> sets a flag for <b>Tcl_ServiceAll</b> that
    causes it to return without servicing any events. This flag is called the
    <i>service mode</i>; <b>Tcl_DoOneEvent</b> restores it to its previous value
    before it returns.</p>
<p class="Pp">In some cases, however, it may be necessary for
    <b>Tcl_ServiceAll</b> to service events even when it has been invoked from
    <b>Tcl_DoOneEvent</b>. This happens when there is yet another recursive
    event loop invoked via an event handler called by <b>Tcl_DoOneEvent</b>
    (such as one that is part of a native widget). In this case,
    <b>Tcl_DoOneEvent</b> may not have a chance to service events so
    <b>Tcl_ServiceAll</b> must service them all. Any recursive event loop that
    calls an external event loop rather than <b>Tcl_DoOneEvent</b> must reset
    the service mode so that all events get processed in <b>Tcl_ServiceAll</b>.
    This is done by invoking the <b>Tcl_SetServiceMode</b> procedure. If
    <b>Tcl_SetServiceMode</b> is passed <b>TCL_SERVICE_NONE</b>, then calls to
    <b>Tcl_ServiceAll</b> will return immediately without processing any events.
    If <b>Tcl_SetServiceMode</b> is passed <b>TCL_SERVICE_ALL</b>, then calls to
    <b>Tcl_ServiceAll</b> will behave normally. <b>Tcl_SetServiceMode</b>
    returns the previous value of the service mode, which should be restored
    when the recursive loop exits. <b>Tcl_GetServiceMode</b> returns the current
    value of the service mode.</p>
