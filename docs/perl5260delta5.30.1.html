<h1 class="Sh" id="Notice"><a class="permalink" href="#Notice">Notice</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">This release includes three updates with widespread effects:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;.&quot;</span> no longer in
      <span class="Li">@INC</span>
    <p class="Pp">For security reasons, the current directory
        (<span class="Li">&quot;.&quot;</span>) is no longer included by default
        at the end of the module search path (<span class="Li">@INC</span>).
        This may have widespread implications for the building, testing and
        installing of modules, and for the execution of scripts. See the section
        &quot;Removal of the current directory
        (<span class="Li">&quot;.&quot;</span>) from
        <span class="Li">@INC</span>&quot; for the full details.</p>
  </li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;do&quot;</span> may now warn
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;do&quot;</span> now gives a deprecation
        warning when it fails to load a file which it would have loaded had
        <span class="Li">&quot;.&quot;</span> been in
        <span class="Li">@INC</span>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>In regular expression patterns, a literal left brace

    <p class="Pp">See &quot;Unescaped literal

<p class="Pp">Using the <span class="Li">&quot;lexical_subs&quot;</span> feature
    introduced in v5.18 no longer emits a warning. Existing code that disables
    the <span class="Li">&quot;experimental::lexical_subs&quot;</span> warning
    category that the feature previously used will continue to work. The
    <span class="Li">&quot;lexical_subs&quot;</span> feature has no effect; all
    Perl code can use lexical subroutines, regardless of what feature
    declarations are in scope.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Indented_Here-documents"><a class="permalink" href="#Indented_Here-documents">Indented
  Here-documents</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">This adds a new modifier <span class="Li">&quot;~&quot;</span> to
    here-docs that tells the parser that it should look for
    <span class="Li">&quot;/^\s*$DELIM\n/&quot;</span> as the closing
  delimiter.</p>
<p class="Pp">These syntaxes are all supported:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    &lt;&lt;~EOF;
    &lt;&lt;~\EOF;
    &lt;&lt;~'EOF';
    &lt;&lt;~&quot;EOF&quot;;
    &lt;&lt;~`EOF`;
    &lt;&lt;~ 'EOF';
    &lt;&lt;~ &quot;EOF&quot;;
    &lt;&lt;~ `EOF`;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;~&quot;</span> modifier will strip,
    from each line in the here-doc, the same whitespace that appears before the
    delimiter.</p>
<p class="Pp">Newlines will be copied as-is, and lines that don't include the
    proper beginning whitespace will cause perl to croak.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    if (1) {
      print &lt;&lt;~EOF;
        Hello there
        EOF
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">prints &quot;Hello there\n&quot; with no leading whitespace.</p>

  regular expression modifier &quot;/xx&quot;</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Specifying two <span class="Li">&quot;x&quot;</span> characters to
    modify a regular expression pattern does everything that a single one does,
    but additionally TAB and SPACE characters within a bracketed character class
    are generally ignored and can be added to improve readability, like
    <span class="Li">&quot;/[&#x00A0;^&#x00A0;A-Z&#x00A0;d-f&#x00A0;p-x&#x00A0;]/xx&quot;</span>.

  &quot;%{^CAPTURE}&quot;, and &quot;%{^CAPTURE_ALL}&quot;</a></h2>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;@{^CAPTURE}&quot;</span> exposes the
    capture buffers of the last match as an array. So <span class="Li">$1</span>
    is <span class="Li">&quot;${^CAPTURE}[0]&quot;</span>. This is a more
    efficient equivalent to code like
    <span class="Li">&quot;substr($matched_string,$-[0],$+[0]-$-[0])&quot;</span>,
    and you don't have to keep track of the
    <span class="Li">$matched_string</span> either. This variable has no single
    character equivalent. Note that, like the other regex magic variables, the
    contents of this variable is dynamic; if you wish to store it beyond the
    lifetime of the match you must copy it to another array.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;%{^CAPTURE}&quot;</span> is equivalent to
    <span class="Li">&quot;%+&quot;</span> (<i>i.e.</i>, named captures). Other
    than being more self-documenting there is no difference between the two
    forms.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;%{^CAPTURE_ALL}&quot;</span> is equivalent
    to <span class="Li">&quot;%-&quot;</span> (<i>i.e.</i>, all named captures).
    Other than being more self-documenting there is no difference between the
    two forms.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Declaring_a_reference_to_a_variable"><a class="permalink" href="#Declaring_a_reference_to_a_variable">Declaring
  a reference to a variable</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">As an experimental feature, Perl now allows the referencing
    operator to come after <span class="Li">&quot;my()&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;state()&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;our()&quot;</span>, or
    <span class="Li">&quot;local()&quot;</span>. This syntax must be enabled
    with <span class="Li">&quot;use feature 'declared_refs'&quot;</span>. It is
    experimental, and will warn by default unless <span class="Li">&quot;no
    warnings 'experimental::refaliasing'&quot;</span> is in effect. It is
    intended mainly for use in assignments to references. For example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    use experimental 'refaliasing', 'declared_refs';
    my \$a = \$b;

<p class="Pp">A list of changes is at
    &lt;http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode9.0.0/&gt;. Modules that are
    shipped with core Perl but not maintained by p5p do not necessarily support
    Unicode 9.0. Unicode::Normalize does work on 9.0.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Use_of__"><a class="permalink" href="#Use_of__">Use of
  &quot;\p{<span class="Li"><i>script</i></span>}&quot; uses the improved
  Script_Extensions property</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Unicode 6.0 introduced an improved form of the Script
    (<span class="Li">&quot;sc&quot;</span>) property, and called it
    Script_Extensions (<span class="Li">&quot;scx&quot;</span>). Perl now uses
    this improved version when a property is specified as just
    <span class="Li">&quot;\p{</span><span class="Li"><i>script</i></span><span class="Li">}&quot;</span>.
    This should make programs more accurate when determining if a character is
    used in a given script, but there is a slight chance of breakage for
    programs that very specifically needed the old behavior. The meaning of
    compound forms, like
    <span class="Li">&quot;\p{sc=</span><span class="Li"><i>script</i></span><span class="Li">}&quot;</span>
    are unchanged. See &quot;Scripts&quot; in perlunicode.</p>

  it</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Some platforms natively do a reasonable job of collating and
    sorting in UTF-8 locales. Perl now works with those. For portability and
    full control, Unicode::Collate is still recommended, but now you may not
    need to do anything special to get good-enough results, depending on your
    application. See &quot;Category

<p class="Pp">In locales that have multi-level character weights,

<p class="Pp">For short keys, 16 bytes and under, we use an optimised variant of
    One At A Time Hard, and for longer keys we use Siphash 1-3. For very long

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Removal_of_the_current_directory_(_._)_from_@INC"><a class="permalink" href="#Removal_of_the_current_directory_(_._)_from_@INC">Removal
  of the current directory (&quot;.&quot;) from @INC</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The perl binary includes a default set of paths in
    <span class="Li">@INC</span>. Historically it has also included the current
    directory (<span class="Li">&quot;.&quot;</span>) as the final entry, unless
    run with taint mode enabled (<span class="Li">&quot;perl -T&quot;</span>).
    While convenient, this has security implications: for example, where a
    script attempts to load an optional module when its current directory is
    untrusted (such as <i>/tmp</i>), it could load and execute code from under
    that directory.</p>
<p class="Pp">Starting with v5.26, <span class="Li">&quot;.&quot;</span> is
    always removed by default, not just under tainting. This has major
    implications for installing modules and executing scripts.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following new features have been added to help ameliorate
    these issues.</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li><i>Configure -Udefault_inc_excludes_dot</i>
    <p class="Pp">There is a new <i>Configure</i> option,
        <span class="Li">&quot;default_inc_excludes_dot&quot;</span> (enabled by
        default) which builds a perl executable without
        <span class="Li">&quot;.&quot;</span>; unsetting this option using
        <span class="Li">&quot;-U&quot;</span> reverts perl to the old
        behaviour. This may fix your path issues but will reintroduce all the
        security concerns, so don't build a perl executable like this unless
        you're <i>really</i> confident that such issues are not a concern in
        your environment.</p>
  </li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;PERL_USE_UNSAFE_INC&quot;</span>
    <p class="Pp">There is a new environment variable recognised by the perl
        interpreter. If this variable has the value 1 when the perl interpreter
        starts up, then <span class="Li">&quot;.&quot;</span> will be
        automatically appended to <span class="Li">@INC</span> (except under
        tainting).</p>
    <p class="Pp">This allows you restore the old perl interpreter behaviour on
        a case-by-case basis. But note that this is intended to be a temporary
        crutch, and this feature will likely be removed in some future perl
        version. It is currently set by the
        <span class="Li">&quot;cpan&quot;</span> utility and
        <span class="Li">&quot;Test::Harness&quot;</span> to ease installation
        of CPAN modules which have not been updated to handle the lack of dot.
        Once again, don't use this unless you are sure that this will not
        reintroduce any security concerns.</p>
  </li>
  <li>A new deprecation warning issued by
      <span class="Li">&quot;do&quot;</span>.
    <p class="Pp">While it is well-known that
        <span class="Li">&quot;use&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;require&quot;</span> use
        <span class="Li">@INC</span> to search for the file to load, many people
        don't realise that <span class="Li">&quot;do
        &quot;file&quot;&quot;</span> also searches <span class="Li">@INC</span>
        if the file is a relative path. With the removal of
        <span class="Li">&quot;.&quot;</span>, a simple
        <span class="Li">&quot;do &quot;file.pl&quot;&quot;</span> will fail to
        read in and execute <span class="Li">&quot;file.pl&quot;</span> from the
        current directory. Since this is commonly expected behaviour, a new
        deprecation warning is now issued whenever
        <span class="Li">&quot;do&quot;</span> fails to load a file which it
        otherwise would have found if a dot had been in
        <span class="Li">@INC</span>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">Here are some things script and module authors may need to do to
    make their software work in the new regime.</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Script authors
    <p class="Pp">If the issue is within your own code (rather than within
        included modules), then you have two main options. Firstly, if you are
        confident that your script will only be run within a trusted directory
        (under which you expect to find trusted files and modules), then add
        <span class="Li">&quot;.&quot;</span> back into the path;
      <i>e.g.</i>:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    BEGIN {
        my $dir = &quot;/some/trusted/directory&quot;;
        chdir $dir or die &quot;Can't chdir to $dir: $!\n&quot;;
        # safe now
        push @INC, '.';
    }
    use &quot;Foo::Bar&quot;; # may load /some/trusted/directory/Foo/Bar.pm
    do &quot;config.pl&quot;; # may load /some/trusted/directory/config.pl
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">On the other hand, if your script is intended to be run from
        within untrusted directories (such as <i>/tmp</i>), then your script
        suddenly failing to load files may be indicative of a security issue.
        You most likely want to replace any relative paths with full paths; for
        example,</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    do &quot;foo_config.pl&quot;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">might become</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    do &quot;$ENV{HOME}/foo_config.pl&quot;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If you are absolutely certain that you want your script to
        load and execute a file from the current directory, then use a
        <span class="Li">&quot;./&quot;</span> prefix; for example:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    do &quot;./foo_config.pl&quot;
    </pre>
  </li>
  <li>Installing and using CPAN modules
    <p class="Pp">If you install a CPAN module using an automatic tool like
        <span class="Li">&quot;cpan&quot;</span>, then this tool will itself set
        the <span class="Li">&quot;PERL_USE_UNSAFE_INC&quot;</span> environment
        variable while building and testing the module, which may be sufficient
        to install a distribution which hasn't been updated to be dot-aware. If
        you want to install such a module manually, then you'll need to replace
        the traditional invocation:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    perl Makefile.PL &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make test &amp;&amp; make install
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">with something like</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    (export PERL_USE_UNSAFE_INC=1; \
     perl Makefile.PL &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make test &amp;&amp; make install)
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Note that this only helps build and install an unfixed module.
        It's possible for the tests to pass (since they were run under
        <span class="Li">&quot;PERL_USE_UNSAFE_INC=1&quot;</span>), but for the
        module itself to fail to perform correctly in production. In this case,
        you may have to temporarily modify your script until a fixed version of
        the module is released. For example:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    use Foo::Bar;
    {
        local @INC = (@INC, '.');
        # assuming read_config() needs '.' in @INC
        $config = Foo::Bar-&gt;read_config();
    }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This is only rarely expected to be necessary. Again, if doing
        this, assess the resultant risks first.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Module Authors
    <p class="Pp">If you maintain a CPAN distribution, it may need updating to
        run in a dotless environment. Although
        <span class="Li">&quot;cpan&quot;</span> and other such tools will
        currently set the
        <span class="Li">&quot;PERL_USE_UNSAFE_INC&quot;</span> during module
        build, this is a temporary workaround for the set of modules which rely
        on <span class="Li">&quot;.&quot;</span> being in
        <span class="Li">@INC</span> for installation and testing, and this may
        mask deeper issues. It could result in a module which passes tests and
        installs, but which fails at run time.</p>
    <p class="Pp">During build, test, and install, it will normally be the case
        that any perl processes will be executing directly within the root
        directory of the untarred distribution, or a known subdirectory of that,
        such as <i>t/</i>. It may well be that <i>Makefile.PL</i> or
        <i>t/foo.t</i> will attempt to include local modules and configuration
        files using their direct relative filenames, which will now fail.</p>
    <p class="Pp">However, as described above, automatic tools like <i>cpan</i>
        will (for now) set the
        <span class="Li">&quot;PERL_USE_UNSAFE_INC&quot;</span> environment
        variable, which introduces dot during a build.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This makes it likely that your existing build and test code
        will work, but this may mask issues with your code which only manifest
        when used after install. It is prudent to try and run your build process
        with that variable explicitly disabled:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    (export PERL_USE_UNSAFE_INC=0; \
     perl Makefile.PL &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make test &amp;&amp; make install)
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This is more likely to show up any potential problems with
        your module's build process, or even with the module itself. Fixing such
        issues will ensure both that your module can again be installed
        manually, and that it will still build once the
        <span class="Li">&quot;PERL_USE_UNSAFE_INC&quot;</span> crutch goes
        away.</p>
    <p class="Pp">When fixing issues in tests due to the removal of dot from
        <span class="Li">@INC</span>, reinsertion of dot into
        <span class="Li">@INC</span> should be performed with caution, for this
        too may suppress real errors in your runtime code. You are encouraged
        wherever possible to apply the aforementioned approaches with explicit
        absolute/relative paths, or to relocate your needed files into a
        subdirectory and insert that subdirectory into
        <span class="Li">@INC</span> instead.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If your runtime code has problems under the dotless
        <span class="Li">@INC</span>, then the comments above on how to fix for
        script authors will mostly apply here too. Bear in mind though that it
        is considered bad form for a module to globally add a dot to
        <span class="Li">@INC</span>, since it introduces both a security risk
        and hides issues of accidentally requiring dot in
        <span class="Li">@INC</span>, as explained above.</p>

<p class="Pp">This is used for debugging of code within PerlIO to avoid

<p class="Pp">If perl performed output at a point where it hadn't yet parsed its

<p class="Pp">Perl now requires the <span class="Li">&quot;-Di&quot;</span>

    default this is written to <span class="Li">&quot;stderr&quot;</span>, but
    can optionally be redirected to a file by setting the

<p class="Pp">If perl is running setuid or the

<p class="Pp">These have been deprecated since v5.16, with a deprecation message
    raised for some uses starting in v5.22. Unfortunately, the code added to

    have. Therefore, enforcement of this ban for these cases is deferred until
    Perl 5.30, but the code has been fixed to raise a default-on deprecation
    message for them in the meantime.</p>
<p class="Pp">Some uses of literal <span class="Li">&quot;{&quot;</span> occur
    in contexts where we do not foresee the meaning ever being anything but the
    literal, such as the very first character in the pattern, or after a
    <span class="Li">&quot;|&quot;</span> meaning alternation. Thus</p>

    changes, these uses do not need to be escaped, and no warning is raised
    about them, and there are no current plans to change this.</p>
<p class="Pp">But it is always correct to escape

<p class="Pp">For Perl to eventually allow string delimiters to be Unicode

<h1 class="Sh" id="Performance_Enhancements"><a class="permalink" href="#Performance_Enhancements">Performance
  Enhancements</a></h1>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>A hash in boolean context is now sometimes faster, <i>e.g.</i>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    if (!%h) { ... }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This was already special-cased, but some cases were missed
        (such as <span class="Li">&quot;grep %$_, @AoH&quot;</span>), and even
        the ones which weren't have been improved.</p>
  </li>
  <li>New Faster Hash Function on 64 bit builds
    <p class="Pp">We use a different hash function for short and long keys. This
        should improve performance and security, especially for long keys.</p>
  </li>
  <li>readline is faster
    <p class="Pp">Reading from a file line-by-line with
        <span class="Li">&quot;readline()&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;&gt;&quot;</span> should now typically be
        faster due to a better implementation of the code that searches for the
        next newline character.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Assigning one reference to another, <i>e.g.</i>
      <span class="Li">&quot;$ref1 = $ref2&quot;</span> has been optimized in
      some cases.</li>
  <li>Remove some exceptions to creating Copy-on-Write strings. The string
      buffer growth algorithm has been slightly altered so that you're less
      likely to encounter a string which can't be COWed.</li>
  <li>Better optimise array and hash assignment: where an array or hash appears
      in the LHS of a list assignment, such as <span class="Li">&quot;(..., @a)
      = (...);&quot;</span>, it's likely to be considerably faster, especially
      if it involves emptying the array/hash. For example, this code runs about
      a third faster compared to Perl 5.24.0:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    my @a;
    for my $i (1..10_000_000) {
        @a = (1,2,3);
        @a = ();
    }
    </pre>
  </li>
  <li>Converting a single-digit string to a number is now substantially
    faster.</li>
  <li>The <span class="Li">&quot;split&quot;</span> builtin is now slightly
      faster in many cases: in particular for the two specially-handled forms
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    my    @a = split ...;
    local @a = split ...;
    </pre>
  </li>
  <li>The rather slow implementation for the experimental subroutine signatures
      feature has been made much faster; it is now comparable in speed with the
      traditional <span class="Li">&quot;my ($a, $b, @c) = @_&quot;</span>.</li>
  <li>Bareword constant strings are now permitted to take part in constant
      folding. They were originally exempted from constant folding in August
      1999, during the development of Perl 5.6, to ensure that
      <span class="Li">&quot;use strict &quot;subs&quot;&quot;</span> would
      still apply to bareword constants. That has now been accomplished a
      different way, so barewords, like other constants, now gain the
      performance benefits of constant folding.
    <p class="Pp">This also means that void-context warnings on constant
        expressions of barewords now report the folded constant operand, rather
        than the operation; this matches the behaviour for non-bareword
        constants.</p>

  <li>Since v5.18, for testing purposes we have included support for building
      perl with a variety of non-standard, and non-recommended hash functions.
      Since we do not recommend the use of these functions, we have removed them
      and their corresponding build options. Specifically this includes the
      following build options:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    PERL_HASH_FUNC_SDBM
    PERL_HASH_FUNC_DJB2
    PERL_HASH_FUNC_SUPERFAST

    PERL_HASH_FUNC_MURMUR_HASH_64A
    PERL_HASH_FUNC_MURMUR_HASH_64B
    </pre>
  </li>
  <li>Remove &quot;Warning: perl appears in your path&quot;
    <p class="Pp">This install warning is more or less obsolete, since most
        platforms already <b>will</b> have a <i>/usr/bin/perl</i> or similar
        provided by the OS.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Reduce verbosity of <span class="Li">&quot;make install.man&quot;</span>
    <p class="Pp">Previously, two progress messages were emitted for each
        manpage: one by installman itself, and one by the function in
        <i>install_lib.pl</i> that it calls to actually install the file.
        Disabling the second of those in each case saves over 750 lines of
        unhelpful output.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Cleanup for <span class="Li">&quot;clang -Weverything&quot;</span>
      support. [perl #129961]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=129961&gt;</li>
  <li><i>Configure</i>: signbit scan was assuming too much, stop assuming
      negative 0.</li>
  <li>Various compiler warnings have been silenced.</li>
  <li>Several smaller changes have been made to remove impediments to compiling
      under C++11.</li>
  <li>Builds using <span class="Li">&quot;USE_PAD_RESET&quot;</span> now work
      again; this configuration had bit-rotted.</li>
  <li>A probe for <span class="Li">&quot;gai_strerror&quot;</span> was added to
      <i>Configure</i> that checks if the
      <span class="Li">&quot;gai_strerror()&quot;</span> routine is available
      and can be used to translate error codes returned by
      <span class="Li">&quot;getaddrinfo()&quot;</span> into human readable
      strings.</li>
  <li><i>Configure</i> now aborts if both
      <span class="Li">&quot;-Duselongdouble&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;-Dusequadmath&quot;</span> are requested. [perl
      #126203]
    &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=126203&gt;</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug in which <i>Configure</i> could append
      <span class="Li">&quot;-quadmath&quot;</span> to the archname even if it
      was already present. [perl #128538]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=128538&gt;</li>
  <li>Clang builds with <span class="Li">&quot;-DPERL_GLOBAL_STRUCT&quot;</span>
      or <span class="Li">&quot;-DPERL_GLOBAL_STRUCT_PRIVATE&quot;</span> have
      been fixed (by disabling Thread Safety Analysis for these
    configurations).</li>
  <li><i>make_ext.pl</i> no longer updates a module's <i>pm_to_blib</i> file
      when no files require updates. This could cause dependencies,
      <i>perlmain.c</i> in particular, to be rebuilt unnecessarily. [perl
      #126710]
    &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=126710&gt;</li>
  <li>The output of <span class="Li">&quot;perl -V&quot;</span> has been
      reformatted so that each configuration and compile-time option is now
      listed one per line, to improve readability.</li>
  <li><i>Configure</i> now builds <span class="Li">&quot;miniperl&quot;</span>
      and <span class="Li">&quot;generate_uudmap&quot;</span> if you invoke it
      with <span class="Li">&quot;-Dusecrosscompiler&quot;</span> but not
      <span class="Li">&quot;-Dtargethost=somehost&quot;</span>. This means you
      can supply your target platform
      <span class="Li">&quot;config.sh&quot;</span>, generate the headers and
      proceed to build your cross-target perl. [perl #127234]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=127234&gt;</li>
  <li>Perl built with
      <span class="Li">&quot;-Accflags=-DPERL_TRACE_OPS&quot;</span> now only
      dumps the operator counts when the environment variable
      <span class="Li">&quot;PERL_TRACE_OPS&quot;</span> is set to a non-zero
      integer. This allows <span class="Li">&quot;make test&quot;</span> to pass
      on such a build.</li>
  <li>When building with GCC 6 and link-time optimization (the
      <span class="Li">&quot;-flto&quot;</span> option to
      <span class="Li">&quot;gcc&quot;</span>), <i>Configure</i> was treating
      all probed symbols as present on the system, regardless of whether they
      actually exist. This has been fixed. [perl #128131]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=128131&gt;</li>
  <li>The <i>t/test.pl</i> library is used for internal testing of Perl itself,
      and also copied by several CPAN modules. Some of those modules must work
      on older versions of Perl, so <i>t/test.pl</i> must in turn avoid newer
      Perl features. Compatibility with Perl 5.8 was inadvertently removed some
      time ago; it has now been restored. [perl #128052]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=128052&gt;</li>
  <li>The build process no longer emits an extra blank line before building each
      &quot;simple&quot; extension (those with only <i>*.pm</i> and <i>*.pod</i>
      files).</li>

<p class="Pp">Tests were added and changed to reflect the other additions and
    changes in this release. Furthermore, these substantive changes were
  made:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>A new test script, <i>comp/parser_run.t</i>, has been added that is like
      <i>comp/parser.t</i> but with <i>test.pl</i> included so that
      <span class="Li">&quot;runperl()&quot;</span> and the like are available
      for use.</li>
  <li>Tests for locales were erroneously using locales incompatible with
    Perl.</li>
  <li>Some parts of the test suite that try to exhaustively test edge cases in
      the regex implementation have been restricted to running for a maximum of
      five minutes. On slow systems they could otherwise take several hours,
      without significantly improving our understanding of the correctness of
      the code under test.</li>
  <li>A new internal facility allows analysing the time taken by the individual
      tests in Perl's own test suite; see
      <i>Porting/harness-timer-report.pl</i>.</li>
  <li><i>t/re/regexp_nonull.t</i> has been added to test that the regular
      expression engine can handle scalars that do not have a null byte just
      past the end of the string.</li>
  <li>A new test script, <i>t/op/decl-refs.t</i>, has been added to test the new
      feature &quot;Declaring a reference to a variable&quot;.</li>
  <li>A new test script, <i>t/re/keep_tabs.t</i> has been added to contain tests
      where <span class="Li">&quot;\t&quot;</span> characters should not be
      expanded into spaces.</li>
  <li>A new test script, <i>t/re/anyof.t</i>, has been added to test that the
      ANYOF nodes generated by bracketed character classes are as expected.</li>
  <li>There is now more extensive testing of the Unicode-related API macros and
      functions.</li>
  <li>Several of the longer running API test files have been split into multiple
      test files so that they can be run in parallel.</li>
  <li><i>t/harness</i> now tries really hard not to run tests which are located
      outside of the Perl source tree. [perl #124050]

  <li>Support for compiling perl on Windows using Microsoft Visual Studio 2015
      (containing Visual C++ 14.0) has been added.
    <p class="Pp">This version of VC++ includes a completely rewritten C
        run-time library, some of the changes in which mean that work done to
        resolve a socket <span class="Li">&quot;close()&quot;</span> bug in perl
        #120091 and perl #118059 is not workable in its current state with this
        version of VC++. Therefore, we have effectively reverted that bug fix
        for VS2015 onwards on the basis that being able to build with VS2015
        onwards is more important than keeping the bug fix. We may revisit this
        in the future to attempt to fix the bug again in a way that is
        compatible with VS2015.</p>
    <p class="Pp">These changes do not affect compilation with GCC or with
        Visual Studio versions up to and including VS2013, <i>i.e.</i>, the bug
        fix is retained (unchanged) for those compilers.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that you may experience compatibility problems if you mix
        a perl built with GCC or VS &lt;= VS2013 with XS modules built with
        VS2015, or if you mix a perl built with VS2015 with XS modules built
        with GCC or VS &lt;= VS2013. Some incompatibility may arise because of
        the bug fix that has been reverted for VS2015 builds of perl, but there
        may well be incompatibility anyway because of the rewritten CRT in
        VS2015 (<i>e.g.</i>, see discussion at
        &lt;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30412951&gt;).</p>

  Changes</a></h1>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>A new API function <span class="Li">&quot;sv_setpv_bufsize()&quot;</span>
      allows simultaneously setting the length and the allocated size of the
      buffer in an <span class="Li">&quot;SV&quot;</span>, growing the buffer if
      necessary.</li>
  <li>A new API macro <span class="Li">&quot;SvPVCLEAR()&quot;</span> sets its
      <span class="Li">&quot;SV&quot;</span> argument to an empty string, like
      Perl-space <span class="Li">&quot;$x = ''&quot;</span>, but with several
      optimisations.</li>
  <li>Several new macros and functions for dealing with Unicode and
      UTF-8-encoded strings have been added to the API, as well as some changes
      in the functionality of existing functions (see &quot;Unicode
      Support&quot; in perlapi for more details):</li>
</ul>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>New versions of the API macros like
      <span class="Li">&quot;isALPHA_utf8&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;toLOWER_utf8&quot;</span> have been added, each
      with the suffix <span class="Li">&quot;_safe&quot;</span>, like
      <span class="Li">&quot;isSPACE_utf8_safe&quot;</span>. These take an extra
      parameter, giving an upper limit of how far into the string it is safe to
      read. Using the old versions could cause attempts to read beyond the end
      of the input buffer if the UTF-8 is not well-formed, and their use now
      raises a deprecation warning. Details are at &quot;Character
      classification&quot; in perlapi.</li>
  <li>Macros like <span class="Li">&quot;isALPHA_utf8&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;toLOWER_utf8&quot;</span> now die if they detect
      that their input UTF-8 is malformed. A deprecation warning had been issued
      since Perl 5.18.</li>
  <li>Several new macros for analysing the validity of utf8 sequences. These
      are:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;UTF8_GOT_ABOVE_31_BIT&quot;</span>
        <span class="Li">&quot;UTF8_GOT_CONTINUATION&quot;</span>
        <span class="Li">&quot;UTF8_GOT_EMPTY&quot;</span>
        <span class="Li">&quot;UTF8_GOT_LONG&quot;</span>
        <span class="Li">&quot;UTF8_GOT_NONCHAR&quot;</span>
        <span class="Li">&quot;UTF8_GOT_NON_CONTINUATION&quot;</span>
        <span class="Li">&quot;UTF8_GOT_OVERFLOW&quot;</span>
        <span class="Li">&quot;UTF8_GOT_SHORT&quot;</span>
        <span class="Li">&quot;UTF8_GOT_SUPER&quot;</span>
        <span class="Li">&quot;UTF8_GOT_SURROGATE&quot;</span>
        <span class="Li">&quot;UTF8_IS_INVARIANT&quot;</span>
        <span class="Li">&quot;UTF8_IS_NONCHAR&quot;</span>
        <span class="Li">&quot;UTF8_IS_SUPER&quot;</span>
        <span class="Li">&quot;UTF8_IS_SURROGATE&quot;</span>
        <span class="Li">&quot;UVCHR_IS_INVARIANT&quot;</span>
        <span class="Li">&quot;isUTF8_CHAR_flags&quot;</span>
        <span class="Li">&quot;isSTRICT_UTF8_CHAR&quot;</span>
        <span class="Li">&quot;isC9_STRICT_UTF8_CHAR&quot;</span></p>
  </li>
  <li>Functions that are all extensions of the
      <span class="Li">&quot;is_utf8_string_</span><span class="Li"><i>*</i></span><span class="Li">()&quot;</span>
      functions, that apply various restrictions to the UTF-8 recognized as
      valid:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;is_strict_utf8_string&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;is_strict_utf8_string_loc&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;is_strict_utf8_string_loclen&quot;</span>,</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;is_c9strict_utf8_string&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;is_c9strict_utf8_string_loc&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;is_c9strict_utf8_string_loclen&quot;</span>,</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;is_utf8_string_flags&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;is_utf8_string_loc_flags&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;is_utf8_string_loclen_flags&quot;</span>,</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;is_utf8_fixed_width_buf_flags&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;is_utf8_fixed_width_buf_loc_flags&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;is_utf8_fixed_width_buf_loclen_flags&quot;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;is_utf8_invariant_string&quot;</span>.
        <span class="Li">&quot;is_utf8_valid_partial_char&quot;</span>.
        <span class="Li">&quot;is_utf8_valid_partial_char_flags&quot;</span>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>The functions <span class="Li">&quot;utf8n_to_uvchr&quot;</span> and its
      derivatives have had several changes of behaviour.
    <p class="Pp">Calling them, while passing a string length of 0 is now
        asserted against in DEBUGGING builds, and otherwise, returns the Unicode
        REPLACEMENT CHARACTER. If you have nothing to decode, you shouldn't call
        the decode function.</p>
    <p class="Pp">They now return the Unicode REPLACEMENT CHARACTER if called
        with UTF-8 that has the overlong malformation and that malformation is
        allowed by the input parameters. This malformation is where the UTF-8
        looks valid syntactically, but there is a shorter sequence that yields
        the same code point. This has been forbidden since Unicode version
      3.1.</p>
    <p class="Pp">They now accept an input flag to allow the overflow
        malformation. This malformation is when the UTF-8 may be syntactically
        valid, but the code point it represents is not capable of being
        represented in the word length on the platform. What &quot;allowed&quot;
        means, in this case, is that the function doesn't return an error, and
        it advances the parse pointer to beyond the UTF-8 in question, but it
        returns the Unicode REPLACEMENT CHARACTER as the value of the code point
        (since the real value is not representable).</p>
    <p class="Pp">They no longer abandon searching for other malformations when
        the first one is encountered. A call to one of these functions thus can
        generate multiple diagnostics, instead of just one.</p>
  </li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;valid_utf8_to_uvchr()&quot;</span> has been added
      to the API (although it was present in core earlier). Like
      <span class="Li">&quot;utf8_to_uvchr_buf()&quot;</span>, but assumes that
      the next character is well-formed. Use with caution.</li>
  <li>A new function, <span class="Li">&quot;utf8n_to_uvchr_error&quot;</span>,
      has been added for use by modules that need to know the details of UTF-8
      malformations beyond pass/fail. Previously, the only ways to know why a
      sequence was ill-formed was to capture and parse the generated diagnostics
      or to do your own analysis.</li>
  <li>There is now a safer version of <b>utf8_hop()</b>, called
      <span class="Li">&quot;utf8_hop_safe()&quot;</span>. Unlike
      <b>utf8_hop()</b>, <b>utf8_hop_safe()</b> won't navigate before the
      beginning or after the end of the supplied buffer.</li>
  <li>Two new functions, <span class="Li">&quot;utf8_hop_forward()&quot;</span>
      and <span class="Li">&quot;utf8_hop_back()&quot;</span> are similar to
      <span class="Li">&quot;utf8_hop_safe()&quot;</span> but are for when you
      know which direction you wish to travel.</li>
  <li>Two new macros which return useful utf8 byte sequences:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;BOM_UTF8&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;REPLACEMENT_CHARACTER_UTF8&quot;</span></p>
  </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="Bd-indent"></div>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Perl is now built with the
      <span class="Li">&quot;PERL_OP_PARENT&quot;</span> compiler define enabled
      by default. To disable it, use the
      <span class="Li">&quot;PERL_NO_OP_PARENT&quot;</span> compiler define.
      This flag alters how the <span class="Li">&quot;op_sibling&quot;</span>
      field is used in <span class="Li">&quot;OP&quot;</span> structures, and
      has been available optionally since perl 5.22.
    <p class="Pp">See &quot;Internal Changes&quot; in perl5220delta for more
        details of what this build option does.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Three new ops, <span class="Li">&quot;OP_ARGELEM&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;OP_ARGDEFELEM&quot;</span>, and
      <span class="Li">&quot;OP_ARGCHECK&quot;</span> have been added. These are
      intended principally to implement the individual elements of a subroutine
      signature, plus any overall checking required.</li>
  <li>The <span class="Li">&quot;OP_PUSHRE&quot;</span> op has been eliminated
      and the <span class="Li">&quot;OP_SPLIT&quot;</span> op has been changed
      from class <span class="Li">&quot;LISTOP&quot;</span> to
      <span class="Li">&quot;PMOP&quot;</span>.
    <p class="Pp">Formerly the first child of a split would be a
        <span class="Li">&quot;pushre&quot;</span>, which would have the
        <span class="Li">&quot;split&quot;</span>'s regex attached to it. Now
        the regex is attached directly to the
        <span class="Li">&quot;split&quot;</span> op, and the
        <span class="Li">&quot;pushre&quot;</span> has been eliminated.</p>
  </li>
  <li>The <span class="Li">&quot;op_class()&quot;</span> API function has been
      added. This is like the existing
      <span class="Li">&quot;OP_CLASS()&quot;</span> macro, but can more
      accurately determine what struct an op has been allocated as. For example
      <span class="Li">&quot;OP_CLASS()&quot;</span> might return
      <span class="Li">&quot;OA_BASEOP_OR_UNOP&quot;</span> indicating that ops
      of this type are usually allocated as an
      <span class="Li">&quot;OP&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;UNOP&quot;</span>; while
      <span class="Li">&quot;op_class()&quot;</span> will return
      <span class="Li">&quot;OPclass_BASEOP&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;OPclass_UNOP&quot;</span> as appropriate.</li>
  <li>All parts of the internals now agree that the
      <span class="Li">&quot;sassign&quot;</span> op is a
      <span class="Li">&quot;BINOP&quot;</span>; previously it was listed as a
      <span class="Li">&quot;BASEOP&quot;</span> in <i>regen/opcodes</i>, which
      meant that several parts of the internals had to be special-cased to
      accommodate it. This oddity's original motivation was to handle code like
      <span class="Li">&quot;$x ||= 1&quot;</span>; that is now handled in a
      simpler way.</li>
  <li>The output format of the <span class="Li">&quot;op_dump()&quot;</span>
      function (as used by <span class="Li">&quot;perl -Dx&quot;</span>) has
      changed: it now displays an &quot;ASCII-art&quot; tree structure, and
      shows more low-level details about each op, such as its address and
    class.</li>
  <li>The <span class="Li">&quot;PADOFFSET&quot;</span> type has changed from
      being unsigned to signed, and several pad-related variables such as
      <span class="Li">&quot;PL_padix&quot;</span> have changed from being of
      type <span class="Li">&quot;I32&quot;</span> to type
      <span class="Li">&quot;PADOFFSET&quot;</span>.</li>
  <li>The <span class="Li">&quot;DEBUGGING&quot;</span>-mode output for regex
      compilation and execution has been enhanced.</li>
  <li>Several obscure SV flags have been eliminated, sometimes along with the
      macros which manipulate them:
      <span class="Li">&quot;SVpbm_VALID&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;SVpbm_TAIL&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;SvTAIL_on&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;SvTAIL_off&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;SVrepl_EVAL&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;SvEVALED&quot;</span>.</li>
  <li>An OP <span class="Li">&quot;op_private&quot;</span> flag has been
      eliminated: <span class="Li">&quot;OPpRUNTIME&quot;</span>. This used to
      often get set on <span class="Li">&quot;PMOP&quot;</span> ops, but had
      become meaningless over time.</li>

      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=121734&gt;</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot; $-{$name} &quot;</span> would leak an

      1&quot;</span>. [perl #130822]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=130822&gt;</li>
  <li>Attempting to use the deprecated variable <span class="Li">$#</span> as
      the object in an indirect object method call could cause a heap use after
      free or buffer overflow. [perl #129274]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=129274&gt;</li>
  <li>When checking for an indirect object method call, in some rare cases the
      parser could reallocate the line buffer but then continue to use pointers
      to the old buffer. [perl #129190]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=129190&gt;</li>
  <li>Supplying a glob as the format argument to

      failure. [perl #130722]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=130722&gt;</li>
  <li>Code like <span class="Li">&quot; $value1 =~ qr/.../ ~~ $value2
      &quot;</span> would have the match converted into a
      <span class="Li">&quot;qr//&quot;</span> operator, leaving extra elements
      on the stack to confuse any surrounding expression. [perl #130705]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=130705&gt;</li>
  <li>Since v5.24 in some obscure cases, a regex which included code blocks from
      multiple sources (<i>e.g.</i>, via embedded via
      <span class="Li">&quot;qr//&quot;</span> objects) could end up with the
      wrong current pad and crash or give weird results. [perl #129881]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=129881&gt;</li>
  <li>Occasionally <span class="Li">&quot;local()&quot;</span>s in a code block
      within a patterns weren't being undone when the pattern matching
      backtracked over the code block. [perl #126697]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=126697&gt;</li>
  <li>Using <span class="Li">&quot;substr()&quot;</span> to modify a magic
      variable could access freed memory in some cases. [perl #129340]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=129340&gt;</li>
  <li>Under <span class="Li">&quot;use utf8&quot;</span>, the entire source code
      is now checked for being UTF-8 well formed, not just quoted strings as
      before. [perl #126310]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=126310&gt;.</li>
  <li>The range operator <span class="Li">&quot;..&quot;</span> on strings now
      handles its arguments correctly when in the scope of the
      <span class="Li">&quot;unicode_strings&quot;</span> feature. The previous
      behaviour was sufficiently unexpected that we believe no correct program
      could have made use of it.</li>
  <li>The <span class="Li">&quot;split&quot;</span> operator did not ensure
      enough space was allocated for its return value in scalar context. It
      could then write a single pointer immediately beyond the end of the memory
      block allocated for the stack. [perl #130262]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=130262&gt;</li>
  <li>Using a large code point with the <span class="Li">&quot;W&quot;</span>
      pack template character with the current output position aligned at just
      the right point could cause a write of a single zero byte immediately
      beyond the end of an allocated buffer. [perl #129149]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=129149&gt;</li>
  <li>Supplying a format's picture argument as part of the format argument list

  <li>Fixed a place where the regex parser was not setting the syntax error
      correctly on a syntactically incorrect pattern. [perl #129122]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=129122&gt;</li>
  <li>The <span class="Li">&quot;&amp;.&quot;</span> operator (and the
      <span class="Li">&quot;&amp;&quot;</span> operator, when it treats its
      arguments as strings) were failing to append a trailing null byte if at
      least one string was marked as utf8 internally. Many code paths (system
      calls, regexp compilation) still expect there to be a null byte in the
      string buffer just past the end of the logical string. An assertion
      failure was the result. [perl #129287]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=129287&gt;</li>
  <li>Avoid a heap-after-use error in the parser when creating an error messge

  <li>Fixed the parser error handling in subroutine attributes for an
      '<span class="Li">&quot;:attr(foo&quot;</span>' that does not have an
      ending '<span class="Li">&quot;)&quot;</span>'.</li>
  <li>Fix the perl lexer to correctly handle a backslash as the last char in
      quoted-string context. This actually fixed two bugs, [perl #129064]

  <li>In the API function

      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=129267&gt;</li>
  <li>Problems with in-place array sorts: code like <span class="Li">&quot;@a =
      sort { ... } @a&quot;</span>, where the source and destination of the sort
      are the same plain array, are optimised to do less copying around. Two
      side-effects of this optimisation were that the contents of
      <span class="Li">@a</span> as seen by sort routines were partially sorted;
      and under some circumstances accessing <span class="Li">@a</span> during
      the sort could crash the interpreter. Both these issues have been fixed,
      and Sort functions see the original value of <span class="Li">@a</span>.

  <li><span class="Li">&quot;pack(&quot;p&quot;, ...)&quot;</span> used to emit
      its warning (&quot;Attempt to pack pointer to temporary value&quot;)
      erroneously in some cases, but has been fixed.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">@DB::args</span> is now exempt from &quot;used once&quot;
      warnings. The warnings only occurred under <b>-w</b>, because
      <i>warnings.pm</i> itself uses <span class="Li">@DB::args</span> multiple
      times.</li>
  <li>The use of built-in arrays or hash slices in a double-quoted string no
      longer issues a warning (&quot;Possible unintended interpolation...&quot;)
      if the variable has not been mentioned before. This affected code like
      <span class="Li">&quot;qq|@DB::args|&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;qq|@SIG{'CHLD', 'HUP'}|&quot;</span>. (The special
      variables <span class="Li">&quot;@-&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;@+&quot;</span> were already exempt from the
      warning.)</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;gethostent&quot;</span> and similar functions now
      perform a null check internally, to avoid crashing with the torsocks
      library. This was a regression from v5.22. [perl #128740]

      if the typeglob in question has never been accessed before.</li>
  <li>Mentioning the same constant twice in a row (which is a syntax error) no

  <li>Many issues relating to <span class="Li">&quot;printf

      addition, the &quot;subnormals&quot; (formerly known as
      &quot;denormals&quot;) floating point numbers are now supported both with
      the plain IEEE 754 floating point numbers (64-bit or 128-bit) and the x86
      80-bit &quot;extended precision&quot;. Note that subnormal hexadecimal
      floating point literals will give a warning about &quot;exponent

      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=128734&gt;.</li>
  <li>Use of a string delimiter whose code point is above 2**31 now works
      correctly on platforms that allow this. Previously, certain characters,
      due to truncation, would be confused with other delimiter characters with
      special meaning (such as <span class="Li">&quot;?&quot;</span> in
      <span class="Li">&quot;m?...?&quot;</span>), resulting in inconsistent
      behaviour. Note that this is non-portable, and is based on Perl's
      extension to UTF-8, and is probably not displayable nor enterable by any
      editor. [perl #128738]

  <li>In Perl 5.18, the parsing of
      <span class="Li">&quot;$foo::$bar&quot;</span> was accidentally changed,
      such that it would be treated as

      by the lexer&quot;</span>.</li>
  <li>List assignment in list context where the LHS contained aggregates and
      where there were not enough RHS elements, used to skip scalar lvalues.
      Previously, <span class="Li">&quot;(($a,$b,@c,$d) = (1))&quot;</span> in
      list context returned <span class="Li">&quot;($a)&quot;</span>; now it
      returns <span class="Li">&quot;($a,$b,$d)&quot;</span>.
      <span class="Li">&quot;(($a,$b,$c) = (1))&quot;</span> is unchanged: it
      still returns <span class="Li">&quot;($a,$b,$c)&quot;</span>. This can be
      seen in the following:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    sub inc { $_++ for @_ }
    inc(($a,$b,@c,$d) = (10))
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Formerly, the values of
        <span class="Li">&quot;($a,$b,$d)&quot;</span> would be left as
        <span class="Li">&quot;(11,undef,undef)&quot;</span>; now they are
        <span class="Li">&quot;(11,1,1)&quot;</span>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Code like this: <span class="Li">&quot;/(?{ s!!! })/&quot;</span> could
      trigger infinite recursion on the C stack (not the normal perl stack) when
      the last successful pattern in scope is itself. We avoid the segfault by
      simply forbidding the use of the empty pattern when it would resolve to
      the currently executing pattern. [perl #129903]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=129903&gt;</li>
  <li>Avoid reading beyond the end of the line buffer in perl's lexer when
      there's a short UTF-8 character at the end. [perl #128997]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=128997&gt;</li>
  <li>Alternations in regular expressions were sometimes failing to match a utf8
      string against a utf8 alternate. [perl #129950]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=129950&gt;</li>
  <li>Make <span class="Li">&quot;do &quot;a\0b&quot;&quot;</span> fail silently
      (and return <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> and set
      <span class="Li">$!</span>) instead of throwing an error. [perl #129928]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=129928&gt;</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;chdir&quot;</span> with no argument didn't ensure
      that there was stack space available for returning its result. [perl
      #129130]
    &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=129130&gt;</li>
  <li>All error messages related to <span class="Li">&quot;do&quot;</span> now
      refer to <span class="Li">&quot;do&quot;</span>; some formerly claimed to
      be from <span class="Li">&quot;require&quot;</span> instead.</li>
  <li>Executing <span class="Li">&quot;undef $x&quot;</span> where
      <span class="Li">$x</span> is tied or magical no longer incorrectly blames
      the variable for an uninitialized-value warning encountered by the
      tied/magical code.</li>
  <li>Code like <span class="Li">&quot;$x = $x . &quot;a&quot;&quot;</span> was
      incorrectly failing to yield a use of uninitialized value warning when
      <span class="Li">$x</span> was a lexical variable with an undefined value.
      That has now been fixed. [perl #127877]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=127877&gt;</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;undef *_; shift&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;undef *_; pop&quot;</span> inside a subroutine,
      with no argument to <span class="Li">&quot;shift&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;pop&quot;</span>, began crashing in Perl 5.14, but
      has now been fixed.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;string$scalar-&gt;$*&quot;</span> now correctly
      prefers concatenation overloading to string overloading if
      <span class="Li">&quot;$scalar-&gt;$*&quot;</span> returns an overloaded
      object, bringing it into consistency with
      <span class="Li">$$scalar</span>.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;/@0{0*-&gt;@*/*0&quot;</span> and similar
      contortions used to crash, but no longer do, but merely produce a syntax
      error. [perl #128171]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=128171&gt;</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;do&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;require&quot;</span> with an argument which is a
      reference or typeglob which, when stringified, contains a null character,
      started crashing in Perl 5.20, but has now been fixed. [perl #128182]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=128182&gt;</li>
  <li>Improve the error message for a missing
      <span class="Li">&quot;tie()&quot;</span> package/method. This brings the
      error messages in line with the ones used for normal method calls.</li>
  <li>Parsing bad POSIX charclasses no longer leaks memory. [perl #128313]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=128313&gt;</li>

  <dd>G++ 6 handles subnormal (denormal) floating point values differently than

<p class="Pp">Jon Portnoy (AVENJ), a prolific Perl author and admired Gentoo
    community member, has passed away on August 10, 2016. He will be remembered
    and missed by all those who he came in contact with, and enriched with his
    intellect, wit, and spirit.</p>
<p class="Pp">It is with great sadness that we also note Kip Hampton's passing.
    Probably best known as the author of the Perl &amp; XML column on XML.com,
    he was a core contributor to AxKit, an XML server platform that became an
    Apache Foundation project. He was a frequent speaker in the early days at
    OSCON, and most recently at YAPC::NA in Madison. He was frequently on
    irc.perl.org as ubu, generally in the #axkit-dahut community, the group
    responsible for YAPC::NA Asheville in 2011.</p>
<p class="Pp">Kip and his constant contributions to the community will be
    greatly missed.</p>
