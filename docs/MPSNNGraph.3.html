<p class="Pp">Optimized representation of a graph of MPSNNImageNodes and
    MPSNNFilterNodes Once you have prepared a graph of MPSNNImageNodes and
    MPSNNFilterNodes (and if needed MPSNNStateNodes), you may initialize a
    <b>MPSNNGraph</b> using the <b>MPSNNImageNode</b> that you wish to appear as
    the result. The <b>MPSNNGraph</b> object will introspect the graph
    representation and determine which nodes are needed for inputs, and which
    nodes are produced as output state (if any). Nodes which are not needed to
    calculate the result image node are ignored. Some nodes may be internally
    concatenated with other nodes for better performance.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note: the <b>MPSNNImageNode</b> that you choose as the result node
    may be interior to a graph. This feature is provided as a means to examine
    intermediate computations in the full graph for debugging purposes.</p>
<p class="Pp">During <b>MPSNNGraph</b> construction, the graph attached to the
    result node will be parsed and reduced to an optimized representation. This
    representation may be saved using the <b>NSSecureCoding</b> protocol for
    later recall.</p>
<p class="Pp">When decoding a <b>MPSNNGraph</b> using a NSCoder, it will be
    created against the system default MTLDevice. If you would like to set the
    MTLDevice, your NSCoder should conform to the &lt;MPSDeviceProvider&gt;
    protocol.</p>
<p class="Pp">You may find it helpful to set MPSKernelOptionsVerbose on the
    graph when debugging. To turn this on during <b>MPSKernel</b> initialization
    (including <b>MPSNNGraph</b> initialization) set the MPS_LOG_INFO
    environment variable. There is a lot of information about what optimizations
    are done to your graph, including some information on why certain
    optimizations were not made.</p>

<div class="Bd-indent"><i>commandBuffer</i> The command buffer
<br/>
<i>sourceImages</i> <b>A</b> list of MPSImages to use as the source images for
  the graph. These should be in the same order as the list returned from
  <b>MPSNNGraph.sourceImageHandles</b>. The images may be image arrays.
  Typically, this is only one or two images such as a .JPG decoded into a

  multiple times.
<br/>
<i>sourceStates</i> <b>A</b> list of <b>MPSState</b> objects to use as state for

  If the sourceStates are temporary, the graph will decrement the readCount by
  1, even if the graph actually reads the state multiple times.
<br/>
<i>intermediateImages</i> An optional NSMutableArray to receive any
  <b>MPSImage</b> objects exported as part of its operation. These are only the
  images that were tagged with <b>MPSNNImageNode.exportFromGraph</b> = YES. The
  identity of the states is given by -resultStateHandles. If temporary, each

<p class="Pp">Encode the graph to a MTLCommandBuffer</p>
<p class="Pp">IMPORTANT: Please use [MTLCommandBuffer addCompletedHandler:] to
    determine when this work is done. Use CPU time that would have been spent
    waiting for the GPU to encode the next command buffer and commit it too.
    That way, the work for the next command buffer is ready to go the moment the
    GPU is done. This will keep the GPU busy and running at top speed.</p>
<p class="Pp">Those who ignore this advice and use [MTLCommandBuffer
    waitUntilCompleted] instead will likely cause their code to slow down by a
    factor of two or more. The CPU clock spins down while it waits for the GPU.
    When the GPU completes, the CPU runs slowly for a while until it spins up.
    The GPU has to wait for the CPU to encode more work (at low clock), giving
    it plenty of time to spin its own clock down. In typical CNN graph usage,
    neither may ever reach maximum clock frequency, causing slow down far beyond
    what otherwise would be expected from simple failure to schedule CPU and GPU
    work concurrently. Regrattably, it is probable that every performance
    benchmark you see on the net will be based on [MTLCommandBuffer
    waitUntilCompleted].</p>

<p class="Pp">Convenience method to execute a graph without having to manage
    many Metal details This function will synchronously encode the graph on a
    private command buffer, commit it to a MPS internal command queue and
    return. The GPU will start working. When the GPU is done, the completion
    handler will be called. You should use the intervening time to encode other
    work for execution on the GPU, so that the GPU stays busy and doesn't clock
    down.</p>
<p class="Pp">The work will be performed on the MTLDevice that hosts the source
    images.</p>
<p class="Pp">This is a convenience API. There are a few situations it does not
    handle optimally. These may be better handled using
    [encodeToCommandBuffer:sourceImages:]. Specifically:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>o     If the graph needs to be run multiple times for different images,
<br/>
      it would be better to encode the graph multiple times on the same
<br/>
      command buffer using [encodeToCommandBuffer:sourceImages:]  This
<br/>
      will allow the multiple graphs to share memory for intermediate
<br/>
      storage, dramatically reducing memory usage.
o     If preprocessing or post-processing of the MPSImage is required,
<br/>
      such as resizing or normalization outside of a convolution, it would
<br/>
      be better to encode those things on the same command buffer.
<br/>
      Memory may be saved here too for intermediate storage. (MPSTemporaryImage
<br/>
      lifetime does not span multiple command buffers.)
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><b>Parameters:</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"><i>sourceImages</i> <b>A</b> list of MPSImages to use as
  the source images for the graph. These should be in the same order as the list
  returned from <b>MPSNNGraph.sourceImageHandles</b>. They should be allocated
  against the same MTLDevice. There must be at least one source image. Note:
  this array is intended to handle the case where multiple input images are
  required to generate a single graph result. That is, the graph itself has
  multiple inputs. If you need to execute the graph multiple times, then call
  this API multiple times, or better yet use
  [encodeToCommandBuffer:sourceImages:] multiple times. (See discussion)

<p class="Pp">Reinitialize all graph nodes from data sources <b>A</b> number of
    the nodes that make up a graph have a data source associated with them, for
    example a <b>MPSCNNConvolutionDataSource</b> or a
    <b>MPSCNNBatchNormalizationDataSource</b>. Generally, the data is read from
    these once at graph initialization time and then not looked at again, except
    during the weight / parameter update phase of the corresponding gradient
    nodes and then only if CPU updates are requested. Otherwise, update occurs
    on the GPU, and the data in the data source is thereafter ignored.</p>
<p class="Pp">It can happen, though, that your application has determined the
    graph should load a new set of weights from the data source. When this
    method is called, the graph will find all nodes that support reloading and
    direct them to reinitialize themselves based on their data source.</p>
<p class="Pp">This process occurs immediately. Your application will need to
    make sure any GPU work being done by the graph is complete to ensure data
    coherency. Most nodes do not have a data source and will not be modified.
    Nodes that are not used by the graph will not be updated.</p>
