      error. [GH #15333] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/15333&gt;</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;do&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;require&quot;</span> with an argument which is a
      reference or typeglob which, when stringified, contains a null character,
      started crashing in Perl 5.20, but has now been fixed. [GH #15337]
      &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/15337&gt;</li>
  <li>Expressions containing an <span class="Li">&quot;&amp;&amp;&quot;</span>
      or <span class="Li">&quot;||&quot;</span> operator (or their synonyms
      <span class="Li">&quot;and&quot;</span> and

      some cases. If the left-hand side consisted of either a negated bareword
      constant or a negated <span class="Li">&quot;do {}&quot;</span> block
      containing a constant expression, and the right-hand side consisted of a
      negated non-foldable expression, one of the negations was effectively
      ignored. The same was true of <span class="Li">&quot;if&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;unless&quot;</span> statement modifiers, though
      with the left-hand and right-hand sides swapped. This long-standing bug
      has now been fixed. [GH #15285]

  <li>Assignment variants of any bitwise ops under the
      <span class="Li">&quot;bitwise&quot;</span> feature would crash if the

  <li><span class="Li">&quot;socket&quot;</span> now leaves the error code

      &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/15382&gt;</li>

      with the <b>-x</b> switch. This has been fixed. [GH #15413]
      &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/15413&gt;</li>
  <li>Some obscure cases of subroutines and file handles being freed at the same
      time could result in crashes, but have been fixed. The crash was
      introduced in Perl 5.22. [GH #15435]
      &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/15435&gt;</li>
  <li>Some regular expression parsing glitches could lead to assertion failures
      with regular expressions such as
      <span class="Li">&quot;/(?&lt;=/&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;/(?&lt;!/&quot;</span>. This has now been fixed.
      [GH #15332] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/15332&gt;</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;gethostent&quot;</span> and similar functions now
      perform a null check internally, to avoid crashing with the torsocks
      library. This was a regression from Perl 5.22. [GH #15478]
      &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/15478&gt;</li>
  <li>Mentioning the same constant twice in a row (which is a syntax error) no
      longer fails an assertion under debugging builds. This was a regression
      from Perl 5.20. [GH #15017]
      &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/15017&gt;</li>
  <li>In Perl 5.24 <span class="Li">&quot;fchown&quot;</span> was changed not to
      accept negative one as an argument because in some platforms that is an
      error. However, in some other platforms that is an acceptable argument.
      This change has been reverted. [GH #15523]
      &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/15523&gt;.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;@{x&quot;</span> followed by a newline where
      <span class="Li">&quot;x&quot;</span> represents a control or non-ASCII
      character no longer produces a garbled syntax error message or a crash.
      [GH #15518] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/15518&gt;</li>
  <li>A regression in Perl 5.24 with
      <span class="Li">&quot;tr/\N{U+...}/foo/&quot;</span> when the code point
      was between 128 and 255 has been fixed. [GH #15475]
      &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/15475&gt;.</li>
  <li>Many issues relating to <span class="Li">&quot;printf
      &quot;%a&quot;&quot;</span> of hexadecimal floating point were fixed. In
      addition, the &quot;subnormals&quot; (formerly known as
      &quot;denormals&quot;) floating point numbers are now supported both with
      the plain IEEE 754 floating point numbers (64-bit or 128-bit) and the x86
      80-bit &quot;extended precision&quot;. Note that subnormal hexadecimal
      floating point literals will give a warning about &quot;exponent
      underflow&quot;. [GH #15495]
      &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/15495&gt; [GH #15502]

  <li>The parser could sometimes crash if a bareword came after
      <span class="Li">&quot;evalbytes&quot;</span>. [GH #15586]
      &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/15586&gt;</li>
  <li>Fixed a place where the regex parser was not setting the syntax error
      correctly on a syntactically incorrect pattern. [GH #15565]
      &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/15565&gt;</li>
  <li>A vulnerability in Perl's <span class="Li">&quot;sprintf&quot;</span>
