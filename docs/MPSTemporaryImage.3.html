<b>MPSImage</b> MPSTemporaryImages are for MPSImages with short lifetimes.
<p class="Pp">What is temporary memory? It is memory, plain and simple. Analogy:
    If we use an app as an analogy for a command buffer, then 'Regular memory'
    (such as what backs a <b>MPSImage</b> or the typical MTLTexture) would be
    memory that you allocate at launch and never free. Temporary memory would be
    memory that you free when you are done with it so it can be used for
    something else as needed later in your app. You /could/ write your app to
    allocate everything you will ever need up front, but this is very
    inefficient and quite frankly a pain to plan out in advance. You don't do it
    for your app, so why would you do it for your command buffers?</p>
<p class="Pp">Welcome to the 1970's! We have added a heap.</p>
<p class="Pp">Unsurprisingly, MPSTemporaryImages can provide for profound
    reduction in the the amount of memory used by your application. Like malloc,
    MPS maintains a heap of memory usable in a command buffer. Over the lifetime
    of a command buffer, the same piece of memory may be reused many times. This
    means that each time the same memory is reused, it aliases with previous
    uses. If we aren't careful, we might find that needed data is overwritten by
    successive allocations. However, this is no different than accessing freed
    memory only to discover it doesn't contain what you thought it did anymore,
    so you should be able to keep out of trouble by following a few simple
    rules, like with malloc.</p>
<p class="Pp">To this end, we added some restrictions to help you out and get a
    bit more performance. Some comments are appended in parentheses below to
    extend the analogy of command buffer = program:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>The textures are MTLStorageModePrivate. You can not, for example, use
      [MTLTexture getBytes...] or [MTLTexture replaceRegion...] with them.
      MPSTemporaryImages are strictly read and written by the GPU. (There is
      protected memory to prevent other processes from overwriting your
    heap.)</li>
  <li>The temporary image may be used only on a single MTLCommandBuffer. This
      limits the chronology to a single linear time stream. (The heap is
      specific to just one command buffer. There are no mutexes to coordinate
      timing of simultaneous access by multiple GPUs. Nor are we likely to like
      them if there were. So, we disallow it.)</li>
  <li>The readCount property must be managed correctly. Please see the
      description of the readCount property for full details. (The readCount is
      a reference count for the block of memory that holds your data. The usual
      undefined behaviors apply to reading data that has been released. We
      assert when we can to prevent that from happening accidentally, just as a
      program might segfault. The readCount counts procedural users of the
      object -- MPSKernel.encode... calls that read the
      <b>MPSTemporaryImage</b>. As each reads from it, the readCount is
      automatically decremented. The texture data will be freed in typical usage
      at the right time as the readCount reaches zero, typically with little
      user involvement other than to set the readCount up front. We did examine
      using the main <b>MPSTemporaryImage</b> reference count for this instead
      so that ARC would do work for you automatically. Alas, ARC destroys things
      at end of scope rather than promptly, sometimes resulting in greatly
      increased memory usage. These allocations are large! So, we use this
      method instead.)</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">Since MPSTemporaryImages can only be used with a single
    MTLCommandBuffer, and can not be used off the GPU, they generally should not
    be kept around past the completion of the MTLCommandBuffer. The lifetime of
    MPSTemporaryImages is expected to be typically extremely short, perhaps only
    a few lines of code. Like malloc, it is intended to be fairly cheap to make
    MPSTemporaryImages and throw them away. Please do so.</p>
<p class="Pp">To keep the lifetime of the underlying texture allocation as short
    as possible, the underlying texture is not allocated until the first time
    the <b>MPSTemporaryImage</b> is used by a <b>MPSCNNKernel</b> or the
    .texture property is read. The readCount property serves to limit the
    lifetime on the other end.</p>
<p class="Pp">You may use the <b>MPSTemporaryImage.texture</b> with
    <b>MPSUnaryImageKernel</b> -encode... methods, iff featureChannels &lt;= 4
    and the MTLTexture conforms to requirements of that <b>MPSKernel</b>. There
    is no locking mechanism provided to prevent a MTLTexture returned from the
    .texture property from becoming invalid when the readCount reaches 0.</p>
<p class="Pp">Finally, MPSTemporaryImages are complicated to use with blit
    encoders. Your application should assume that the <b>MPSTemporaryImage</b>
    is backed by a MTLHeap, and consequently needs a MTLFence to ensure that
    compute command encoders and other encoders do not trip over one another
    with heap based memory. MPS will almost never use a blit encoder for this
    reason. If you do need one, then you will need to make a new compute encoder
    to block on whatever previous compute encoder last used the heap block. (MPS
    will not tell you who previously used the heap block. That encoder is almost
    certainly long dead anyway.) If concurrent encoders are involved, then a
    barrier might be needed. Within that compute encoder, you will call
    -updateFence. End the compute encoder, make a blit encoder wait for the
    fence, do the blit, update a new fence, then make a new compute encoder,
    wait for the second fence, then you can continue. Possibly the second
    do-nothing compute encoder needs to be ended so MPS can be called. Frankly,
    we don't bother with blit encoders and just write a compute operation for
    copy / clear as needed, or better yet find a way to eliminate the clear /
    copy pass so we don't have to pay for it. Note: the most common use of a
    blit encoder, -synchronizeResource: can not encounter this problem because
    MPSTemporaryImages live in GPU private memory and can not be read by the
    CPU.</p>
<p class="Pp">MPSTemporaryImages can otherwise be used wherever MPSImages are
    used.</p>

Help MPS decide which allocations to make ahead of time The texture cache that
  underlies the <b>MPSTemporaryImage</b> can automatically allocate new storage
  as needed as you create new temporary images. However, sometimes a more global
  view of what you plan to make is useful for maximizing memory reuse to get the
  most efficient operation. This class method hints to the cache what the list
  of images will be.
<p class="Pp">It is never necessary to call this method. It is purely a
    performance and memory optimization.</p>
<p class="Pp">This method makes a conservative estimate of memory required and
    may not fully cover temporary memory needs, resulting in additional
    allocations later that could encounter pathological behavior, if they are
    too small. If the full extent and timing of the workload is known in
    advance, it is recommended that <b>MPSHintTemporaryMemoryHighWaterMark()</b>
    be used instead.</p>
