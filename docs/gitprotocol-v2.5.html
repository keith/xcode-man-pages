<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">This document presents a specification for a version 2 of
    Git&#x2019;s wire protocol. Protocol v2 will improve upon v1 in the
    following ways:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Instead of multiple service names, multiple
  commands will be supported by a single service</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Easily extendable as capabilities are moved into
  their own section of the protocol, no longer being hidden behind a NUL byte
  and limited by the size of a pkt-line</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Separate out other information hidden behind NUL
  bytes (e.g. agent string as a capability and symrefs can be requested using
  <i>ls-refs</i>)</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Reference advertisement will be omitted unless
  explicitly requested</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;ls-refs command to explicitly request some
  refs</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Designed with http and stateless-rpc in mind.
  With clear flush semantics the http remote helper can simply act as a
  proxy</div>
<p class="Pp">In protocol v2 communication is command oriented. When first
    contacting a server a list of capabilities will be advertised. Some of these
    capabilities will be commands which a client can request be executed. Once a
    command has completed, a client can reuse the connection and request that
    other commands be executed.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="PACKET"><a class="permalink" href="#PACKET">PACKET-LINE
  FRAMING</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">All communication is done using packet-line framing, just as in
    v1. See <b>gitprotocol-pack</b>(5) and <b>gitprotocol-common</b>(5) for more
    information.</p>
<p class="Pp">In protocol v2 these special packets will have the following
    semantics:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<i>0000</i> Flush Packet (flush-pkt) - indicates
  the end of a message</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<i>0001</i> Delimiter Packet (delim-pkt) -
  separates sections of a message</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<i>0002</i> Response End Packet
  (response-end-pkt) - indicates the end of a response for stateless
  connections</div>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="INITIAL_CLIENT_REQUEST"><a class="permalink" href="#INITIAL_CLIENT_REQUEST">INITIAL
  CLIENT REQUEST</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">In general a client can request to speak protocol v2 by sending
    <b>version=2</b> through the respective side-channel for the transport being
    used which inevitably sets <b>GIT_PROTOCOL</b>. More information can be
    found in <b>gitprotocol-pack</b>(5) and <b>gitprotocol-http</b>(5), as well
    as the <b>GIT_PROTOCOL</b> definition in <b>git</b>(1). In all cases the
    response from the server is the capability advertisement.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Git_Transport"><a class="permalink" href="#Git_Transport">Git
  Transport</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">When using the git:// transport, you can request to use protocol
    v2 by sending &quot;version=2&quot; as an extra parameter:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>003egit-upload-pack /project.git\0host=myserver.com\0\0version=2\0</pre>
</div>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="SSH_and_File_Transport"><a class="permalink" href="#SSH_and_File_Transport">SSH
  and File Transport</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">When using either the ssh:// or file:// transport, the
    GIT_PROTOCOL environment variable must be set explicitly to include
    &quot;version=2&quot;. The server may need to be configured to allow this
    environment variable to pass.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="HTTP_Transport"><a class="permalink" href="#HTTP_Transport">HTTP
  Transport</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">When using the http:// or https:// transport a client makes a
    &quot;smart&quot; info/refs request as described in
    <b>gitprotocol-http</b>(5) and requests that v2 be used by supplying
    &quot;version=2&quot; in the <b>Git-Protocol</b> header.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>C: GET $GIT_URL/info/refs?service=git-upload-pack HTTP/1.0
C: Git-Protocol: version=2</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">A v2 server would reply:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>S: 200 OK
S: &lt;Some headers&gt;
S: ...
S:
S: 000eversion 2\n
S: &lt;capability-advertisement&gt;</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Subsequent requests are then made directly to the service
    <b>$GIT_URL/git-upload-pack</b>. (This works the same for
  git-receive-pack).</p>
<p class="Pp">Uses the <b>--http-backend-info-refs</b> option to
    <b>git-upload-pack</b>(1).</p>
<p class="Pp">The server may need to be configured to pass this header&#x2019;s
    contents via the <b>GIT_PROTOCOL</b> variable. See the discussion in
    <b>git-http-backend</b>(1).</p>
</section>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="CAPABILITY_ADVERTISEMENT"><a class="permalink" href="#CAPABILITY_ADVERTISEMENT">CAPABILITY
  ADVERTISEMENT</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">A server which decides to communicate (based on a request from a
    client) using protocol version 2, notifies the client by sending a version
    string in its initial response followed by an advertisement of its
    capabilities. Each capability is a key with an optional value. Clients must
    ignore all unknown keys. Semantics of unknown values are left to the
    definition of each key. Some capabilities will describe commands which can
    be requested to be executed by the client.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>capability-advertisement = protocol-version
<br/>
      capability-list
<br/>
      flush-pkt</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>protocol-version = PKT-LINE(&quot;version 2&quot; LF)
capability-list = *capability
capability = PKT-LINE(key[=value] LF)</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>key = 1*(ALPHA | DIGIT | &quot;-_&quot;)
value = 1*(ALPHA | DIGIT | &quot; -_.,?\/{}[]()&lt;&gt;!@#$%^&amp;*+=:;&quot;)</pre>
</div>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="COMMAND_REQUEST"><a class="permalink" href="#COMMAND_REQUEST">COMMAND
  REQUEST</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">After receiving the capability advertisement, a client can then
    issue a request to select the command it wants with any particular
    capabilities or arguments. There is then an optional section where the
    client can provide any command specific parameters or queries. Only a single
    command can be requested at a time.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>request = empty-request | command-request
empty-request = flush-pkt
command-request = command
<br/>
    capability-list
<br/>
    delim-pkt
<br/>
    command-args
<br/>
    flush-pkt
command = PKT-LINE(&quot;command=&quot; key LF)
command-args = *command-specific-arg</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>command-specific-args are packet line framed arguments defined by
each individual command.</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The server will then check to ensure that the client&#x2019;s
    request is comprised of a valid command as well as valid capabilities which
    were advertised. If the request is valid the server will then execute the
    command. A server MUST wait till it has received the client&#x2019;s entire
    request before issuing a response. The format of the response is determined
    by the command being executed, but in all cases a flush-pkt indicates the
    end of the response.</p>
<p class="Pp">When a command has finished, and the client has received the
    entire response from the server, a client can either request that another
    command be executed or can terminate the connection. A client may optionally
    send an empty request consisting of just a flush-pkt to indicate that no
    more requests will be made.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="CAPABILITIES"><a class="permalink" href="#CAPABILITIES">CAPABILITIES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">There are two different types of capabilities: normal
    capabilities, which can be used to convey information or alter the behavior
    of a request, and commands, which are the core actions that a client wants
    to perform (fetch, push, etc).</p>
<p class="Pp">Protocol version 2 is stateless by default. This means that all
    commands must only last a single round and be stateless from the perspective
    of the server side, unless the client has requested a capability indicating
    that state should be maintained by the server. Clients MUST NOT require
    state management on the server side in order to function correctly. This
    permits simple round-robin load-balancing on the server side, without
    needing to worry about state management.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="agent"><a class="permalink" href="#agent">agent</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The server can advertise the <b>agent</b> capability with a value
    <b>X</b> (in the form <b>agent=X</b>) to notify the client that the server
    is running version <b>X</b>. The client may optionally send its own agent
    string by including the <b>agent</b> capability with a value <b>Y</b> (in
    the form <b>agent=Y</b>) in its request to the server (but it MUST NOT do so
    if the server did not advertise the agent capability). The <b>X</b> and
    <b>Y</b> strings may contain any printable ASCII characters except space
    (i.e., the byte range 33 &#x27E8; x &#x27E8; 126), and are typically of the
    form &quot;package/version-os&quot; (e.g., &quot;git/1.8.3.1-Linux&quot;)
    where <b>os</b> is the operating system name (e.g., &quot;Linux&quot;).
    <b>X</b> and <b>Y</b> can be configured using the GIT_USER_AGENT environment
    variable and it takes priority. The <b>os</b> is retrieved using the
    <i>sysname</i> field of the <b>uname</b>(<b>2</b>) system call or its
    equivalent. The agent strings are purely informative for statistics and
    debugging purposes, and MUST NOT be used to programmatically assume the
    presence or absence of particular features.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="ls"><a class="permalink" href="#ls">ls-refs</a></h2>
<p class="Pp"><b>ls-refs</b> is the command used to request a reference
    advertisement in v2. Unlike the current reference advertisement, ls-refs
    takes in arguments which can be used to limit the refs sent from the
  server.</p>
<p class="Pp">Additional features not supported in the base command will be
    advertised as the value of the command in the capability advertisement in
    the form of a space separated list of features:
    &quot;&lt;command&gt;=&lt;feature-1&gt; &lt;feature-2&gt;&quot;</p>
<p class="Pp">ls-refs takes in the following arguments:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<br/>
   symrefs
In addition to the object pointed by it, show the underlying ref
pointed by it when showing a symbolic ref.
<br/>
   peel
Show peeled tags.
<br/>
   ref-prefix &lt;prefix&gt;
When specified, only references having a prefix matching one of
the provided prefixes are displayed. Multiple instances may be
given, in which case references matching any prefix will be
shown. Note that this is purely for optimization; a server MAY
show refs not matching the prefix if it chooses, and clients
should filter the result themselves.</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">If the <i>unborn</i> feature is advertised the following argument
    can be included in the client&#x2019;s request.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<br/>
   unborn
The server will send information about HEAD even if it is a symref
pointing to an unborn branch in the form &quot;unborn HEAD
symref-target:&lt;target&gt;&quot;.</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The output of ls-refs is as follows:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>output = *ref
<br/>
  flush-pkt
obj-id-or-unborn = (obj-id | &quot;unborn&quot;)
ref = PKT-LINE(obj-id-or-unborn SP refname *(SP ref-attribute) LF)
ref-attribute = (symref | peeled)
symref = &quot;symref-target:&quot; symref-target
peeled = &quot;peeled:&quot; obj-id</pre>
</div>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="fetch"><a class="permalink" href="#fetch">fetch</a></h2>
<p class="Pp"><b>fetch</b> is the command used to fetch a packfile in v2. It can
    be looked at as a modified version of the v1 fetch where the
    ref-advertisement is stripped out (since the <b>ls-refs</b> command fills
    that role) and the message format is tweaked to eliminate redundancies and
    permit easy addition of future extensions.</p>
<p class="Pp">Additional features not supported in the base command will be
    advertised as the value of the command in the capability advertisement in
    the form of a space separated list of features:
    &quot;&lt;command&gt;=&lt;feature-1&gt; &lt;feature-2&gt;&quot;</p>
<p class="Pp">A <b>fetch</b> request can take the following arguments:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<br/>
   want &lt;oid&gt;
Indicates to the server an object which the client wants to
retrieve.  Wants can be anything and are not limited to
advertised objects.</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<br/>
   have &lt;oid&gt;
Indicates to the server an object which the client has locally.
This allows the server to make a packfile which only contains
the objects that the client needs. Multiple 'have' lines can be
supplied.</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<br/>
   done
Indicates to the server that negotiation should terminate (or
not even begin if performing a clone) and that the server should
use the information supplied in the request to construct the
packfile.</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<br/>
   thin-pack
Request that a thin pack be sent, which is a pack with deltas
which reference base objects not contained within the pack (but
are known to exist at the receiving end). This can reduce the
network traffic significantly, but it requires the receiving end
to know how to &quot;thicken&quot; these packs by adding the missing bases
to the pack.</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<br/>
   no-progress
Request that progress information that would normally be sent on
side-band channel 2, during the packfile transfer, should not be
sent.  However, the side-band channel 3 is still used for error
responses.</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<br/>
   include-tag
Request that annotated tags should be sent if the objects they
point to are being sent.</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<br/>
   ofs-delta
Indicate that the client understands PACKv2 with delta referring
to its base by position in pack rather than by an oid.  That is,
they can read OBJ_OFS_DELTA (aka type 6) in a packfile.</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">If the <i>shallow</i> feature is advertised the following
    arguments can be included in the clients request as well as the potential
    addition of the <i>shallow-info</i> section in the server&#x2019;s response
    as explained below.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<br/>
   shallow &lt;oid&gt;
A client must notify the server of all commits for which it only
has shallow copies (meaning that it doesn't have the parents of
a commit) by supplying a 'shallow &lt;oid&gt;' line for each such
object so that the server is aware of the limitations of the
client's history.  This is so that the server is aware that the
client may not have all objects reachable from such commits.</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<br/>
   deepen &lt;depth&gt;
Requests that the fetch/clone should be shallow having a commit
depth of &lt;depth&gt; relative to the remote side.</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<br/>
   deepen-relative
Requests that the semantics of the &quot;deepen&quot; command be changed
to indicate that the depth requested is relative to the client's
current shallow boundary, instead of relative to the requested
commits.</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<br/>
   deepen-since &lt;timestamp&gt;
Requests that the shallow clone/fetch should be cut at a
specific time, instead of depth.  Internally it's equivalent to
doing &quot;git rev-list --max-age=&lt;timestamp&gt;&quot;. Cannot be used with
&quot;deepen&quot;.</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<br/>
   deepen-not &lt;rev&gt;
Requests that the shallow clone/fetch should be cut at a
specific revision specified by '&lt;rev&gt;', instead of a depth.
Internally it's equivalent of doing &quot;git rev-list --not &lt;rev&gt;&quot;.
Cannot be used with &quot;deepen&quot;, but can be used with
&quot;deepen-since&quot;.</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">If the <i>filter</i> feature is advertised, the following argument
    can be included in the client&#x2019;s request:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<br/>
   filter &lt;filter-spec&gt;
Request that various objects from the packfile be omitted
using one of several filtering techniques. These are intended
for use with partial clone and partial fetch operations. See
`rev-list` for possible &quot;filter-spec&quot; values. When communicating
with other processes, senders SHOULD translate scaled integers
(e.g. &quot;1k&quot;) into a fully-expanded form (e.g. &quot;1024&quot;) to aid
interoperability with older receivers that may not understand
newly-invented scaling suffixes. However, receivers SHOULD
accept the following suffixes: 'k', 'm', and 'g' for 1024,
1048576, and 1073741824, respectively.</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">If the <i>ref-in-want</i> feature is advertised, the following
    argument can be included in the client&#x2019;s request as well as the
    potential addition of the <i>wanted-refs</i> section in the server&#x2019;s
    response as explained below.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<br/>
   want-ref &lt;ref&gt;
Indicates to the server that the client wants to retrieve a
particular ref, where &lt;ref&gt; is the full name of a ref on the
server.  It is a protocol error to send want-ref for the
same ref more than once.</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">If the <i>sideband-all</i> feature is advertised, the following
    argument can be included in the client&#x2019;s request:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<br/>
   sideband-all
Instruct the server to send the whole response multiplexed, not just
the packfile section. All non-flush and non-delim PKT-LINE in the
response (not only in the packfile section) will then start with a byte
indicating its sideband (1, 2, or 3), and the server may send &quot;0005\2&quot;
(a PKT-LINE of sideband 2 with no payload) as a keepalive packet.</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">If the <i>packfile-uris</i> feature is advertised, the following
    argument can be included in the client&#x2019;s request as well as the
    potential addition of the <i>packfile-uris</i> section in the
    server&#x2019;s response as explained below. Note that at most one
    <b>packfile-uris</b> line can be sent to the server.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<br/>
   packfile-uris &lt;comma-separated-list-of-protocols&gt;
Indicates to the server that the client is willing to receive
URIs of any of the given protocols in place of objects in the
sent packfile. Before performing the connectivity check, the
client should download from all given URIs. Currently, the
protocols supported are &quot;http&quot; and &quot;https&quot;.</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">If the <i>wait-for-done</i> feature is advertised, the following
    argument can be included in the client&#x2019;s request.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<br/>
   wait-for-done
Indicates to the server that it should never send &quot;ready&quot;, but
should wait for the client to say &quot;done&quot; before sending the
packfile.</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The response of <b>fetch</b> is broken into a number of sections
    separated by delimiter packets (0001), with each section beginning with its
    section header. Most sections are sent only when the packfile is sent.</p>

    that the server is able to deal with objects using hash algorithm X. If not

<p class="Pp">Session IDs should be unique to a given process. They must fit

<p class="Pp">If the <i>bundle-uri</i> capability is advertised, the server
    supports the &#x201C;bundle-uri&#x201D; command.</p>
<p class="Pp">The capability is currently advertised with no value (i.e. not
    &quot;bundle-uri=somevalue&quot;), a value may be added in the future for
    supporting command-wide extensions. Clients MUST ignore any unknown
    capability values and proceed with the 'bundle-uri` dialog they support.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>bundle-uri</i> command is intended to be issued before
    <b>fetch</b> to get URIs to bundle files (see <b>git-bundle</b>(1)) to
    &quot;seed&quot; and inform the subsequent <b>fetch</b> command.</p>
<p class="Pp">The client CAN issue <b>bundle-uri</b> before or after any other
    valid command. To be useful to clients it&#x2019;s expected that
    it&#x2019;ll be issued after an <b>ls-refs</b> and before <b>fetch</b>, but
    CAN be issued at any time in the dialog.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>DISCUSSION of bundle-uri</b>
  <br/>
</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">The intent of the feature is optimize for server resource
    consumption in the common case by changing the common case of fetching a
    very large PACK during <b>git-clone</b>(1) into a smaller incremental
  fetch.</p>
<p class="Pp">It also allows servers to achieve better caching in combination
    with an <b>uploadpack.packObjectsHook</b> (see <b>git-config</b>(1)).</p>
<p class="Pp">By having new clones or fetches be a more predictable and common
    negotiation against the tips of recently produces *.bundle file(s). Servers
    might even pre-generate the results of such negotiations for the
    <b>uploadpack.packObjectsHook</b> as new pushes come in.</p>
<p class="Pp">One way that servers could take advantage of these bundles is that
    the server would anticipate that fresh clones will download a known bundle,
    followed by catching up to the current state of the repository using ref
    tips found in that bundle (or bundles).</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>PROTOCOL for bundle-uri</b>
  <br/>
</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">A <b>bundle-uri</b> request takes no arguments, and as noted above
    does not currently advertise a capability value. Both may be added in the
    future.</p>
<p class="Pp">When the client issues a <b>command=bundle-uri</b> request, the
    response is a list of key-value pairs provided as packet lines with value
    <i>&lt;key&gt;</i><b>=</b><i>&lt;value&gt;</i>. Each <i>&lt;key&gt;</i>
    should be interpreted as a config key from the <b>bundle.*</b> namespace to
    construct a list of bundles. These keys are grouped by a
    <b>bundle.</b><i>&lt;id&gt;</i>. subsection, where each key corresponding to
    a given <i>&lt;id&gt;</i> contributes attributes to the bundle defined by
    that <i>&lt;id&gt;</i>. See <b>git-config</b>(1) for the specific details of
    these keys and how the Git client will interpret their values.</p>
<p class="Pp">Clients MUST parse the line according to the above format, lines
    that do not conform to the format SHOULD be discarded. The user MAY be
    warned in such a case.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>bundle-uri CLIENT AND SERVER EXPECTATIONS</b>
  <br/>
</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">URI CONTENTS</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The content at the advertised URIs MUST be one of two
  types.
<p class="Pp">The advertised URI may contain a bundle file that <b>git</b>
    <b>bundle</b> <b>verify</b> would accept. I.e. they MUST contain one or more
    reference tips for use by the client, MUST indicate prerequisites (in any)
    with standard &quot;-&quot; prefixes, and MUST indicate their
    &quot;object-format&quot;, if applicable.</p>
<p class="Pp">The advertised URI may alternatively contain a plaintext file that
    <b>git</b> <b>config</b> <b>--list</b> would accept (with the <b>--file</b>
    option). The key-value pairs in this list are in the <b>bundle.*</b>
    namespace (see <b>git-config</b>(1)).</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">bundle-uri CLIENT ERROR RECOVERY</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A client MUST above all gracefully degrade on errors,
  whether that error is because of bad missing/data in the bundle URI(s),
  because that client is too dumb to e.g. understand and fully parse out bundle
  headers and their prerequisite relationships, or something else.
<p class="Pp">Server operators should feel confident in turning on
    &quot;bundle-uri&quot; and not worry if e.g. their CDN goes down that clones
    or fetches will run into hard failures. Even if the server bundle(s) are
    incomplete, or bad in some way the client should still end up with a
    functioning repository, just as if it had chosen not to use this protocol
    extension.</p>
<p class="Pp">All subsequent discussion on client and server interaction MUST
    keep this in mind.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">bundle-uri SERVER TO CLIENT</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The ordering of the returned bundle uris is not
  significant. Clients MUST parse their headers to discover their contained OIDS
  and prerequisites. A client MUST consider the content of the bundle(s)
  themselves and their header as the ultimate source of truth.
<p class="Pp">A server MAY even return bundle(s) that don&#x2019;t have any
    direct relationship to the repository being cloned (either through accident,
    or intentional &quot;clever&quot; configuration), and expect a client to
    sort out what data they&#x2019;d like from the bundle(s), if any.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">bundle-uri CLIENT TO SERVER</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The client SHOULD provide reference tips found in the
  bundle header(s) as <i>have</i> lines in any subsequent <b>fetch</b> request.
  A client MAY also ignore the bundle(s) entirely if doing so is deemed worse
  for some reason, e.g. if the bundles can&#x2019;t be downloaded, it
  doesn&#x2019;t like the tips it finds etc.</div>
<p class="Pp">WHEN ADVERTISED BUNDLE(S) REQUIRE NO FURTHER NEGOTIATION</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If after issuing <b>bundle-uri</b> and <b>ls-refs</b>,
  and getting the header(s) of the bundle(s) the client finds that the ref tips
  it wants can be retrieved entirely from advertised bundle(s), the client MAY
  disconnect from the Git server. The results of such a <i>clone</i> or
  <i>fetch</i> should be indistinguishable from the state attained without using
  bundle-uri.</div>
<p class="Pp">EARLY CLIENT DISCONNECTIONS AND ERROR RECOVERY</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A client MAY perform an early disconnect while still
  downloading the bundle(s) (having streamed and parsed their headers). In such
  a case the client MUST gracefully recover from any errors related to finishing
  the download and validation of the bundle(s).
<p class="Pp">I.e. a client might need to re-connect and issue a <i>fetch</i>
    command, and possibly fall back to not making use of <i>bundle-uri</i> at
    all.</p>
<p class="Pp">This &quot;MAY&quot; behavior is specified as such (and not a
    &quot;SHOULD&quot;) on the assumption that a server advertising bundle uris
    is more likely than not to be serving up a relatively large repository, and
    to be pointing to URIs that have a good chance of being in working order. A
    client MAY e.g. look at the payload size of the bundles as a heuristic to
    see if an early disconnect is worth it, should falling back on a full
    &quot;fetch&quot; dialog be necessary.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">WHEN ADVERTISED BUNDLE(S) REQUIRE FURTHER NEGOTIATION</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A client SHOULD commence a negotiation of a PACK from the
  server via the &quot;fetch&quot; command using the OID tips found in
  advertised bundles, even if&#x2019;s still in the process of downloading those
  bundle(s).
<p class="Pp">This allows for aggressive early disconnects from any interactive
    server dialog. The client blindly trusts that the advertised OID tips are
    relevant, and issues them as <i>have</i> lines, it then requests any tips it
    would like (usually from the &quot;ls-refs&quot; advertisement) via
    <i>want</i> lines. The server will then compute a (hopefully small) PACK
    with the expected difference between the tips from the bundle(s) and the
    data requested.</p>
<p class="Pp">The only connection the client then needs to keep active is to the
    concurrently downloading static bundle(s), when those and the incremental
    PACK are retrieved they should be inflated and validated. Any errors at this
    point should be gracefully recovered from, see above.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>bundle-uri PROTOCOL FEATURES</b>
  <br/>
</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">The client constructs a bundle list from the
    <i>&lt;key&gt;</i><b>=</b><i>&lt;value&gt;</i> pairs provided by the server.
    These pairs are part of the <b>bundle.*</b> namespace as documented in
    <b>git-config</b>(1). In this section, we discuss some of these keys and
    describe the actions the client will do in response to this information.</p>
<p class="Pp">In particular, the <b>bundle.version</b> key specifies an integer
    value. The only accepted value at the moment is <b>1</b>, but if the client
    sees an unexpected value here then the client MUST ignore the bundle
  list.</p>
<p class="Pp">As long as <b>bundle.version</b> is understood, all other unknown
    keys MAY be ignored by the client. The server will guarantee compatibility
    with older clients, though newer clients may be better able to use the extra
    keys to minimize downloads.</p>
<p class="Pp">Any backwards-incompatible addition of pre-URI key-value will be
    guarded by a new <b>bundle.version</b> value or values in <i>bundle-uri</i>
    capability advertisement itself, and/or by new future <b>bundle-uri</b>
    request arguments.</p>
<p class="Pp">Some example key-value pairs that are not currently implemented
    but could be implemented in the future include:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Add a &quot;hash=&lt;val&gt;&quot; or
  &quot;size=&lt;bytes&gt;&quot; advertise the expected hash or size of the
  bundle file.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Advertise that one or more bundle files are the
  same (to e.g. have clients round-robin or otherwise choose one of N possible
  files).</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;A &quot;oid=&lt;OID&gt;&quot; shortcut and
  &quot;prerequisite=&lt;OID&gt;&quot; shortcut. For expressing the common case
  of a bundle with one tip and no prerequisites, or one tip and one
  prerequisite.
<p class="Pp">This would allow for optimizing the common case of servers
    who&#x2019;d like to provide one &quot;big bundle&quot; containing only
    their &quot;main&quot; branch, and/or incremental updates thereof.</p>
<p class="Pp">A client receiving such a response MAY assume that they can skip
    retrieving the header from a bundle at the indicated URI, and thus save
    themselves and the server(s) the request(s) needed to inspect the headers of
    that bundle or bundles.</p>
</div>
</div>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="promisor"><a class="permalink" href="#promisor">promisor-remote=&lt;pr-infos&gt;</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The server may advertise some promisor remotes it is using or
    knows about to a client which may want to use them as its promisor remotes,
    instead of this repository. In this case &lt;pr-infos&gt; should be of the
    form:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>pr-infos = pr-info | pr-infos &quot;;&quot; pr-info</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>pr-info = &quot;name=&quot; pr-name | &quot;name=&quot; pr-name &quot;,&quot; &quot;url=&quot; pr-url</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">where <b>pr-name</b> is the urlencoded name of a promisor remote,
    and <b>pr-url</b> the urlencoded URL of that promisor remote.</p>
<p class="Pp">In this case, if the client decides to use one or more promisor
    remotes the server advertised, it can reply with
    &quot;promisor-remote=&lt;pr-names&gt;&quot; where &lt;pr-names&gt; should
    be of the form:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>pr-names = pr-name | pr-names &quot;;&quot; pr-name</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">where <b>pr-name</b> is the urlencoded name of a promisor remote
    the server advertised and the client accepts.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that, everywhere in this document, <b>pr-name</b> MUST be a
    valid remote name, and the <i>;</i> and <i>,</i> characters MUST be encoded
    if they appear in <b>pr-name</b> or <b>pr-url</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the server doesn&#x2019;t know any promisor remote that could
    be good for a client to use, or prefers a client not to use any promisor
    remote it uses or knows about, it shouldn&#x2019;t advertise the
    &quot;promisor-remote&quot; capability at all.</p>
<p class="Pp">In this case, or if the client doesn&#x2019;t want to use any
    promisor remote the server advertised, the client shouldn&#x2019;t advertise
    the &quot;promisor-remote&quot; capability at all in its reply.</p>
<p class="Pp">The &quot;promisor.advertise&quot; and
    &quot;promisor.acceptFromServer&quot; configuration options can be used on
    the server and client side to control what they advertise or accept
    respectively. See the documentation of these configuration options for more
    information.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that in the future it would be nice if the
    &quot;promisor-remote&quot; protocol capability could be used by the server,
    when responding to <b>git</b> <b>fetch</b> or <b>git</b> <b>clone</b>, to
    advertise better-connected remotes that the client can use as promisor
    remotes, instead of this repository, so that the client can lazily fetch
    objects from these other better-connected remotes. This would require the
    server to omit in its response the objects available on the better-connected
    remotes that the client has accepted. This hasn&#x2019;t been implemented
    yet though. So for now this &quot;promisor-remote&quot; capability is useful
    only when the server advertises some promisor remotes it already uses to
    borrow objects from.</p>
