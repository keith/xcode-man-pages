<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">This document presents a specification for a version 2 of
    Git&#x2019;s wire protocol. Protocol v2 will improve upon v1 in the
    following ways:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Instead of multiple service names, multiple
  commands will be supported by a single service</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Easily extendable as capabilities are moved into
  their own section of the protocol, no longer being hidden behind a NUL byte
  and limited by the size of a pkt-line</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Separate out other information hidden behind NUL
  bytes (e.g. agent string as a capability and symrefs can be requested using
  <i>ls-refs</i>)</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Reference advertisement will be omitted unless
  explicitly requested</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;ls-refs command to explicitly request some
  refs</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Designed with http and stateless-rpc in mind.
  With clear flush semantics the http remote helper can simply act as a
  proxy</div>
<p class="Pp">In protocol v2 communication is command oriented. When first
    contacting a server a list of capabilities will advertised. Some of these
    capabilities will be commands which a client can request be executed. Once a
    command has completed, a client can reuse the connection and request that
    other commands be executed.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="PACKET"><a class="permalink" href="#PACKET">PACKET-LINE
  FRAMING</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">All communication is done using packet-line framing, just as in
    v1. See <b>gitprotocol-pack</b>(5) and <b>gitprotocol-common</b>(5) for more
    information.</p>
<p class="Pp">In protocol v2 these special packets will have the following
    semantics:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<i>0000</i> Flush Packet (flush-pkt) - indicates
  the end of a message</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<i>0001</i> Delimiter Packet (delim-pkt) -
  separates sections of a message</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<i>0002</i> Response End Packet
  (response-end-pkt) - indicates the end of a response for stateless
  connections</div>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="INITIAL_CLIENT_REQUEST"><a class="permalink" href="#INITIAL_CLIENT_REQUEST">INITIAL
  CLIENT REQUEST</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">In general a client can request to speak protocol v2 by sending
    <b>version=2</b> through the respective side-channel for the transport being
    used which inevitably sets <b>GIT_PROTOCOL</b>. More information can be
    found in <b>gitprotocol-pack</b>(5) and <b>gitprotocol-http</b>(5), as well
    as the <b>GIT_PROTOCOL</b> definition in <b>git.txt</b>. In all cases the
    response from the server is the capability advertisement.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Git_Transport"><a class="permalink" href="#Git_Transport">Git
  Transport</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">When using the git:// transport, you can request to use protocol
    v2 by sending &quot;version=2&quot; as an extra parameter:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>003egit-upload-pack /project.git\0host=myserver.com\0\0version=2\0</pre>
</div>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="SSH_and_File_Transport"><a class="permalink" href="#SSH_and_File_Transport">SSH
  and File Transport</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">When using either the ssh:// or file:// transport, the
    GIT_PROTOCOL environment variable must be set explicitly to include
    &quot;version=2&quot;. The server may need to be configured to allow this
    environment variable to pass.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="HTTP_Transport"><a class="permalink" href="#HTTP_Transport">HTTP
  Transport</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">When using the http:// or https:// transport a client makes a
    &quot;smart&quot; info/refs request as described in
    <b>gitprotocol-http</b>(5) and requests that v2 be used by supplying
    &quot;version=2&quot; in the <b>Git-Protocol</b> header.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>C: GET $GIT_URL/info/refs?service=git-upload-pack HTTP/1.0
C: Git-Protocol: version=2</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">A v2 server would reply:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>S: 200 OK
S: &lt;Some headers&gt;
S: ...
S:
S: 000eversion 2\n
S: &lt;capability-advertisement&gt;</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Subsequent requests are then made directly to the service
    <b>$GIT_URL/git-upload-pack</b>. (This works the same for
  git-receive-pack).</p>
<p class="Pp">Uses the <b>--http-backend-info-refs</b> option to
    <b>git-upload-pack</b>(1).</p>
<p class="Pp">The server may need to be configured to pass this header&#x2019;s
    contents via the <b>GIT_PROTOCOL</b> variable. See the discussion in
    <b>git-http-backend.txt</b>.</p>
</section>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="CAPABILITY_ADVERTISEMENT"><a class="permalink" href="#CAPABILITY_ADVERTISEMENT">CAPABILITY
  ADVERTISEMENT</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">A server which decides to communicate (based on a request from a
    client) using protocol version 2, notifies the client by sending a version
    string in its initial response followed by an advertisement of its
    capabilities. Each capability is a key with an optional value. Clients must
    ignore all unknown keys. Semantics of unknown values are left to the
    definition of each key. Some capabilities will describe commands which can
    be requested to be executed by the client.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>capability-advertisement = protocol-version
<br/>
                           capability-list
<br/>
                           flush-pkt</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>protocol-version = PKT-LINE(&quot;version 2&quot; LF)
capability-list = *capability
capability = PKT-LINE(key[=value] LF)</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>key = 1*(ALPHA | DIGIT | &quot;-_&quot;)
value = 1*(ALPHA | DIGIT | &quot; -_.,?\/{}[]()&lt;&gt;!@#$%^&amp;*+=:;&quot;)</pre>
</div>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="COMMAND_REQUEST"><a class="permalink" href="#COMMAND_REQUEST">COMMAND
  REQUEST</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">After receiving the capability advertisement, a client can then
    issue a request to select the command it wants with any particular
    capabilities or arguments. There is then an optional section where the
    client can provide any command specific parameters or queries. Only a single
    command can be requested at a time.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>request = empty-request | command-request
empty-request = flush-pkt
command-request = command
<br/>
                  capability-list
<br/>
                  delim-pkt
<br/>
                  command-args
<br/>
                  flush-pkt
command = PKT-LINE(&quot;command=&quot; key LF)
command-args = *command-specific-arg</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>command-specific-args are packet line framed arguments defined by
each individual command.</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The server will then check to ensure that the client&#x2019;s
    request is comprised of a valid command as well as valid capabilities which
    were advertised. If the request is valid the server will then execute the
    command. A server MUST wait till it has received the client&#x2019;s entire
    request before issuing a response. The format of the response is determined
    by the command being executed, but in all cases a flush-pkt indicates the
    end of the response.</p>
<p class="Pp">When a command has finished, and the client has received the
    entire response from the server, a client can either request that another
    command be executed or can terminate the connection. A client may optionally
    send an empty request consisting of just a flush-pkt to indicate that no
    more requests will be made.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="CAPABILITIES"><a class="permalink" href="#CAPABILITIES">CAPABILITIES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">There are two different types of capabilities: normal
    capabilities, which can be used to convey information or alter the behavior
    of a request, and commands, which are the core actions that a client wants
    to perform (fetch, push, etc).</p>
<p class="Pp">Protocol version 2 is stateless by default. This means that all
    commands must only last a single round and be stateless from the perspective
    of the server side, unless the client has requested a capability indicating
    that state should be maintained by the server. Clients MUST NOT require
    state management on the server side in order to function correctly. This
    permits simple round-robin load-balancing on the server side, without
    needing to worry about state management.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="agent"><a class="permalink" href="#agent">agent</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The server can advertise the <b>agent</b> capability with a value
    <b>X</b> (in the form <b>agent=X</b>) to notify the client that the server
    is running version <b>X</b>. The client may optionally send its own agent
    string by including the <b>agent</b> capability with a value <b>Y</b> (in
    the form <b>agent=Y</b>) in its request to the server (but it MUST NOT do so
    if the server did not advertise the agent capability). The <b>X</b> and
    <b>Y</b> strings may contain any printable ASCII characters except space
    (i.e., the byte range 32 &lt; x &lt; 127), and are typically of the form
    &quot;package/version&quot; (e.g., &quot;git/1.8.3.1&quot;). The agent
    strings are purely informative for statistics and debugging purposes, and
    MUST NOT be used to programmatically assume the presence or absence of
    particular features.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="ls"><a class="permalink" href="#ls">ls-refs</a></h2>
<p class="Pp"><b>ls-refs</b> is the command used to request a reference
    advertisement in v2. Unlike the current reference advertisement, ls-refs
    takes in arguments which can be used to limit the refs sent from the
  server.</p>
<p class="Pp">Additional features not supported in the base command will be
    advertised as the value of the command in the capability advertisement in
    the form of a space separated list of features:
    &quot;&lt;command&gt;=&lt;feature 1&gt; &lt;feature 2&gt;&quot;</p>
<p class="Pp">ls-refs takes in the following arguments:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>symrefs
<br/>
    In addition to the object pointed by it, show the underlying ref
<br/>
    pointed by it when showing a symbolic ref.
peel
<br/>
    Show peeled tags.
ref-prefix &lt;prefix&gt;
<br/>
    When specified, only references having a prefix matching one of
<br/>
    the provided prefixes are displayed. Multiple instances may be
<br/>
    given, in which case references matching any prefix will be
<br/>
    shown. Note that this is purely for optimization; a server MAY
<br/>
    show refs not matching the prefix if it chooses, and clients
<br/>
    should filter the result themselves.</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">If the <i>unborn</i> feature is advertised the following argument
    can be included in the client&#x2019;s request.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>unborn
<br/>
    The server will send information about HEAD even if it is a symref
<br/>
    pointing to an unborn branch in the form &quot;unborn HEAD
<br/>
    symref-target:&lt;target&gt;&quot;.</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The output of ls-refs is as follows:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>output = *ref
<br/>
         flush-pkt
obj-id-or-unborn = (obj-id | &quot;unborn&quot;)
ref = PKT-LINE(obj-id-or-unborn SP refname *(SP ref-attribute) LF)
ref-attribute = (symref | peeled)
symref = &quot;symref-target:&quot; symref-target
peeled = &quot;peeled:&quot; obj-id</pre>
</div>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="fetch"><a class="permalink" href="#fetch">fetch</a></h2>
<p class="Pp"><b>fetch</b> is the command used to fetch a packfile in v2. It can
    be looked at as a modified version of the v1 fetch where the
    ref-advertisement is stripped out (since the <b>ls-refs</b> command fills
    that role) and the message format is tweaked to eliminate redundancies and
    permit easy addition of future extensions.</p>
<p class="Pp">Additional features not supported in the base command will be
    advertised as the value of the command in the capability advertisement in
    the form of a space separated list of features:
    &quot;&lt;command&gt;=&lt;feature 1&gt; &lt;feature 2&gt;&quot;</p>
<p class="Pp">A <b>fetch</b> request can take the following arguments:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>want &lt;oid&gt;
<br/>
    Indicates to the server an object which the client wants to
<br/>
    retrieve.  Wants can be anything and are not limited to
<br/>
    advertised objects.</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>have &lt;oid&gt;
<br/>
    Indicates to the server an object which the client has locally.
<br/>
    This allows the server to make a packfile which only contains
<br/>
    the objects that the client needs. Multiple 'have' lines can be
<br/>
    supplied.</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>done
<br/>
    Indicates to the server that negotiation should terminate (or
<br/>
    not even begin if performing a clone) and that the server should
<br/>
    use the information supplied in the request to construct the
<br/>
    packfile.</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>thin-pack
<br/>
    Request that a thin pack be sent, which is a pack with deltas
<br/>
    which reference base objects not contained within the pack (but
<br/>
    are known to exist at the receiving end). This can reduce the
<br/>
    network traffic significantly, but it requires the receiving end
<br/>
    to know how to &quot;thicken&quot; these packs by adding the missing bases
<br/>
    to the pack.</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>no-progress
<br/>
    Request that progress information that would normally be sent on
<br/>
    side-band channel 2, during the packfile transfer, should not be
<br/>
    sent.  However, the side-band channel 3 is still used for error
<br/>
    responses.</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>include-tag
<br/>
    Request that annotated tags should be sent if the objects they
<br/>
    point to are being sent.</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>ofs-delta
<br/>
    Indicate that the client understands PACKv2 with delta referring
<br/>
    to its base by position in pack rather than by an oid.  That is,
<br/>
    they can read OBJ_OFS_DELTA (aka type 6) in a packfile.</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">If the <i>shallow</i> feature is advertised the following
    arguments can be included in the clients request as well as the potential
    addition of the <i>shallow-info</i> section in the server&#x2019;s response
    as explained below.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>shallow &lt;oid&gt;
<br/>
    A client must notify the server of all commits for which it only
<br/>
    has shallow copies (meaning that it doesn't have the parents of
<br/>
    a commit) by supplying a 'shallow &lt;oid&gt;' line for each such
<br/>
    object so that the server is aware of the limitations of the
<br/>
    client's history.  This is so that the server is aware that the
<br/>
    client may not have all objects reachable from such commits.</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>deepen &lt;depth&gt;
<br/>
    Requests that the fetch/clone should be shallow having a commit
<br/>
    depth of &lt;depth&gt; relative to the remote side.</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>deepen-relative
<br/>
    Requests that the semantics of the &quot;deepen&quot; command be changed
<br/>
    to indicate that the depth requested is relative to the client's
<br/>
    current shallow boundary, instead of relative to the requested
<br/>
    commits.</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>deepen-since &lt;timestamp&gt;
<br/>
    Requests that the shallow clone/fetch should be cut at a
<br/>
    specific time, instead of depth.  Internally it's equivalent to
<br/>
    doing &quot;git rev-list --max-age=&lt;timestamp&gt;&quot;. Cannot be used with
<br/>
    &quot;deepen&quot;.</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>deepen-not &lt;rev&gt;
<br/>
    Requests that the shallow clone/fetch should be cut at a
<br/>
    specific revision specified by '&lt;rev&gt;', instead of a depth.
<br/>
    Internally it's equivalent of doing &quot;git rev-list --not &lt;rev&gt;&quot;.
<br/>
    Cannot be used with &quot;deepen&quot;, but can be used with
<br/>
    &quot;deepen-since&quot;.</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">If the <i>filter</i> feature is advertised, the following argument
    can be included in the client&#x2019;s request:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>filter &lt;filter-spec&gt;
<br/>
    Request that various objects from the packfile be omitted
<br/>
    using one of several filtering techniques. These are intended
<br/>
    for use with partial clone and partial fetch operations. See
<br/>
    `rev-list` for possible &quot;filter-spec&quot; values. When communicating
<br/>
    with other processes, senders SHOULD translate scaled integers
<br/>
    (e.g. &quot;1k&quot;) into a fully-expanded form (e.g. &quot;1024&quot;) to aid
<br/>
    interoperability with older receivers that may not understand
<br/>
    newly-invented scaling suffixes. However, receivers SHOULD
<br/>
    accept the following suffixes: 'k', 'm', and 'g' for 1024,
<br/>
    1048576, and 1073741824, respectively.</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">If the <i>ref-in-want</i> feature is advertised, the following
    argument can be included in the client&#x2019;s request as well as the
    potential addition of the <i>wanted-refs</i> section in the server&#x2019;s
    response as explained below.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>want-ref &lt;ref&gt;
<br/>
    Indicates to the server that the client wants to retrieve a
<br/>
    particular ref, where &lt;ref&gt; is the full name of a ref on the
<br/>
    server.</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">If the <i>sideband-all</i> feature is advertised, the following
    argument can be included in the client&#x2019;s request:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>sideband-all
<br/>
    Instruct the server to send the whole response multiplexed, not just
<br/>
    the packfile section. All non-flush and non-delim PKT-LINE in the
<br/>
    response (not only in the packfile section) will then start with a byte
<br/>
    indicating its sideband (1, 2, or 3), and the server may send &quot;0005\2&quot;
<br/>
    (a PKT-LINE of sideband 2 with no payload) as a keepalive packet.</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">If the <i>packfile-uris</i> feature is advertised, the following
    argument can be included in the client&#x2019;s request as well as the
    potential addition of the <i>packfile-uris</i> section in the
    server&#x2019;s response as explained below.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>packfile-uris &lt;comma-separated list of protocols&gt;
<br/>
    Indicates to the server that the client is willing to receive
<br/>
    URIs of any of the given protocols in place of objects in the
<br/>
    sent packfile. Before performing the connectivity check, the
<br/>
    client should download from all given URIs. Currently, the
<br/>
    protocols supported are &quot;http&quot; and &quot;https&quot;.</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">If the <i>wait-for-done</i> feature is advertised, the following
    argument can be included in the client&#x2019;s request.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>wait-for-done
<br/>
    Indicates to the server that it should never send &quot;ready&quot;, but
<br/>
    should wait for the client to say &quot;done&quot; before sending the
<br/>
    packfile.</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The response of <b>fetch</b> is broken into a number of sections
    separated by delimiter packets (0001), with each section beginning with its
