<p class="Pp">These messages are classified as follows (listed in increasing
    order of desperation):</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    (W) A warning (optional).
    (D) A deprecation (enabled by default).
    (S) A severe warning (enabled by default).
    (F) A fatal error (trappable).
    (P) An internal error you should never see (trappable).
    (X) A very fatal error (nontrappable).
    (A) An alien error message (not generated by Perl).
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The majority of messages from the first three classifications
    above (W, D &amp; S) can be controlled using the
    <span class="Li">&quot;warnings&quot;</span> pragma.</p>
<p class="Pp">If a message can be controlled by the
    <span class="Li">&quot;warnings&quot;</span> pragma, its warning category is
    included with the classification letter in the description below. E.g.
    <span class="Li">&quot;(W closed)&quot;</span> means a warning in the
    <span class="Li">&quot;closed&quot;</span> category.</p>
<p class="Pp">Optional warnings are enabled by using the
    <span class="Li">&quot;warnings&quot;</span> pragma or the <b>-w</b> and
    <b>-W</b> switches. Warnings may be captured by setting
    <span class="Li">$SIG{__WARN__}</span> to a reference to a routine that will
    be called on each warning instead of printing it. See perlvar.</p>
<p class="Pp">Severe warnings are always enabled, unless they are explicitly
    disabled with the <span class="Li">&quot;warnings&quot;</span> pragma or the
    <b>-X</b> switch.</p>
<p class="Pp">Trappable errors may be trapped using the eval operator. See
    &quot;eval&quot; in perlfunc. In almost all cases, warnings may be
    selectively disabled or promoted to fatal errors using the
    <span class="Li">&quot;warnings&quot;</span> pragma. See warnings.</p>
<p class="Pp">The messages are in alphabetical order, without regard to upper or
    lower-case. Some of these messages are generic. Spots that vary are denoted
    with a <span class="Li">%s</span> or other printf-style escape. These
    escapes are ignored by the alphabetical order, as are all characters other
    than letters. To look up your message, just ignore anything that is not a
    letter.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="accept()"><a class="permalink" href="#accept()"><i>accept()</i> on
    closed socket %s</a></dt>
  <dd>(W closed) You tried to do an accept on a closed socket. Did you forget to
      check the return value of your <i>socket()</i> call? See
      &quot;accept&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt id="Allocation"><a class="permalink" href="#Allocation">Allocation too
    large: %x</a></dt>
  <dd>(X) You can't allocate more than 64K on an MS-DOS machine.</dd>
  <dt>'%c' allowed only after types %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) The modifiers '!', '&lt;' and '&gt;' are allowed in <i>pack()</i> or
      <i>unpack()</i> only after certain types. See &quot;pack&quot; in
      perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt id="Ambiguous"><a class="permalink" href="#Ambiguous">Ambiguous call
    resolved as CORE::%s(), qualify as such or use &amp;</a></dt>
  <dd>(W ambiguous) A subroutine you have declared has the same name as a Perl
      keyword, and you have used the name without qualification for calling one
      or the other. Perl decided to call the builtin because the subroutine is
      not imported.
    <p class="Pp">To force interpretation as a subroutine call, either put an
        ampersand before the subroutine name, or qualify the name with its
        package. Alternatively, you can import the subroutine (or pretend that
        it's imported with the <span class="Li">&quot;use subs&quot;</span>
        pragma).</p>
    <p class="Pp">To silently interpret it as the Perl operator, use the
        <span class="Li">&quot;CORE::&quot;</span> prefix on the operator (e.g.
        <span class="Li">&quot;CORE::log($x)&quot;</span>) or declare the
        subroutine to be an object method (see &quot;Subroutine Attributes&quot;
        in perlsub or attributes).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="Ambiguous~2"><a class="permalink" href="#Ambiguous~2">Ambiguous range
    in transliteration operator</a></dt>
  <dd>(F) You wrote something like
      <span class="Li">&quot;tr/a-z-0//&quot;</span> which doesn't mean anything
      at all. To include a <span class="Li">&quot;-&quot;</span> character in a
      transliteration, put it either first or last. (In the past,
      <span class="Li">&quot;tr/a-z-0//&quot;</span> was synonymous with
      <span class="Li">&quot;tr/a-y//&quot;</span>, which was probably not what
      you would have expected.)</dd>
  <dt id="Ambiguous~3"><a class="permalink" href="#Ambiguous~3">Ambiguous use of
    %s resolved as %s</a></dt>
  <dd>(S ambiguous) You said something that may not be interpreted the way you
      thought. Normally it's pretty easy to disambiguate it by supplying a
      missing quote, operator, parenthesis pair or declaration.</dd>
  <dt id="Ambiguous~4"><a class="permalink" href="#Ambiguous~4">Ambiguous use of
    %c resolved as operator %c</a></dt>
  <dd>(S ambiguous) <span class="Li">&quot;%&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;&amp;&quot;</span>, and
      <span class="Li">&quot;*&quot;</span> are both infix operators (modulus,
      bitwise and, and multiplication) <i>and</i> initial special characters
      (denoting hashes, subroutines and typeglobs), and you said something like
      <span class="Li">&quot;*foo * foo&quot;</span> that might be interpreted
      as either of them. We assumed you meant the infix operator, but please try
      to make it more clear -- in the example given, you might write
      <span class="Li">&quot;*foo * foo()&quot;</span> if you really meant to
      multiply a glob by the result of calling a function.</dd>
  <dt id="Ambiguous~5"><a class="permalink" href="#Ambiguous~5">Ambiguous use of
    %c{%s} resolved to %c%s</a></dt>
  <dd>(W ambiguous) You wrote something like
      <span class="Li">&quot;@{foo}&quot;</span>, which might be asking for the
      variable <span class="Li">@foo</span>, or it might be calling a function
      named foo, and dereferencing it as an array reference. If you wanted the
      variable, you can just write <span class="Li">@foo</span>. If you wanted
      to call the function, write <span class="Li">&quot;@{foo()}&quot;</span>
      ... or you could just not have a variable and a function with the same
      name, and save yourself a lot of trouble.</dd>
  <dt id="Ambiguous~6"><a class="permalink" href="#Ambiguous~6">Ambiguous use of
    %c{%s[...]} resolved to %c%s[...]</a></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt id="Ambiguous~7"><a class="permalink" href="#Ambiguous~7">Ambiguous use of
    %c{%s{...}} resolved to %c%s{...}</a></dt>
  <dd>(W ambiguous) You wrote something like
      <span class="Li">&quot;${foo[2]}&quot;</span> (where foo represents the
      name of a Perl keyword), which might be looking for element number 2 of
      the array named <span class="Li">@foo</span>, in which case please write
      <span class="Li">$foo[2]</span>, or you might have meant to pass an
      anonymous arrayref to the function named foo, and then do a scalar deref
      on the value it returns. If you meant that, write
      <span class="Li">&quot;${foo([2])}&quot;</span>.
    <p class="Pp">In regular expressions, the
        <span class="Li">&quot;${foo[2]}&quot;</span> syntax is sometimes
        necessary to disambiguate between array subscripts and character
        classes. <span class="Li">&quot;/$length[2345]/&quot;</span>, for
        instance, will be interpreted as <span class="Li">$length</span>
        followed by the character class
        <span class="Li">&quot;[2345]&quot;</span>. If an array subscript is
        what you want, you can avoid the warning by changing
        <span class="Li">&quot;/${length[2345]}/&quot;</span> to the unsightly
        <span class="Li">&quot;/${\$length[2345]}/&quot;</span>, by renaming
        your array to something that does not coincide with a built-in keyword,
        or by simply turning off warnings with <span class="Li">&quot;no
        warnings 'ambiguous';&quot;</span>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="Ambiguous~8"><a class="permalink" href="#Ambiguous~8">Ambiguous use of
    -%s resolved as -&amp;%s()</a></dt>
  <dd>(S ambiguous) You wrote something like
      <span class="Li">&quot;-foo&quot;</span>, which might be the string
      <span class="Li">&quot;-foo&quot;</span>, or a call to the function
      <span class="Li">&quot;foo&quot;</span>, negated. If you meant the string,
      just write <span class="Li">&quot;-foo&quot;</span>. If you meant the
      function call, write <span class="Li">&quot;-foo()&quot;</span>.</dd>
  <dt>'|' and '&lt;' may not both be specified on command line</dt>
  <dd>(F) An error peculiar to VMS. Perl does its own command line redirection,
      and found that STDIN was a pipe, and that you also tried to redirect STDIN
      using '&lt;'. Only one STDIN stream to a customer, please.</dd>
  <dt>'|' and '&gt;' may not both be specified on command line</dt>
  <dd>(F) An error peculiar to VMS. Perl does its own command line redirection,
      and thinks you tried to redirect stdout both to a file and into a pipe to
      another command. You need to choose one or the other, though nothing's
      stopping you from piping into a program or Perl script which 'splits'
      output into two streams, such as
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    open(OUT,&quot;&gt;$ARGV[0]&quot;) or die &quot;Can't write to $ARGV[0]: $!&quot;;
    while (&lt;STDIN&gt;) {
        print;
        print OUT;
    }
    close OUT;
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt id="Applying"><a class="permalink" href="#Applying">Applying %s to %s will
    act on scalar(%s)</a></dt>
  <dd>(W misc) The pattern match (<span class="Li">&quot;//&quot;</span>),
      substitution (<span class="Li">&quot;s///&quot;</span>), and
      transliteration (<span class="Li">&quot;tr///&quot;</span>) operators work
      on scalar values. If you apply one of them to an array or a hash, it will
      convert the array or hash to a scalar value (the length of an array, or
      the population info of a hash) and then work on that scalar value. This is
      probably not what you meant to do. See &quot;grep&quot; in perlfunc and
      &quot;map&quot; in perlfunc for alternatives.</dd>
  <dt id="Arg"><a class="permalink" href="#Arg">Arg too short for
    msgsnd</a></dt>
  <dd>(F) <i>msgsnd()</i> requires a string at least as long as
    sizeof(long).</dd>
  <dt>%s argument is not a HASH or ARRAY element or a subroutine</dt>
  <dd>(F) The argument to <i>exists()</i> must be a hash or array element or a
      subroutine with an ampersand, such as:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    $foo{$bar}
    $ref-&gt;{&quot;susie&quot;}[12]
    &amp;do_something
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>%s argument is not a HASH or ARRAY element or slice</dt>
  <dd>(F) The argument to <i>delete()</i> must be either a hash or array
      element, such as:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    $foo{$bar}
    $ref-&gt;{&quot;susie&quot;}[12]
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">or a hash or array slice, such as:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    @foo[$bar, $baz, $xyzzy]
    @{$ref-&gt;[12]}{&quot;susie&quot;, &quot;queue&quot;}
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>%s argument is not a subroutine name</dt>
  <dd>(F) The argument to <i>exists()</i> for <span class="Li">&quot;exists
      &amp;sub&quot;</span> must be a subroutine name, and not a subroutine
      call. <span class="Li">&quot;exists &amp;sub()&quot;</span> will generate
      this error.</dd>
  <dt id="Argument"><a class="permalink" href="#Argument">Argument
    &quot;%s&quot; isn't numeric%s</a></dt>
  <dd>(W numeric) The indicated string was fed as an argument to an operator
      that expected a numeric value instead. If you're fortunate the message
      will identify which operator was so unfortunate.</dd>
  <dt id="Argument~2"><a class="permalink" href="#Argument~2">Argument list not
    closed for PerlIO layer &quot;%s&quot;</a></dt>
  <dd>(W layer) When pushing a layer with arguments onto the Perl I/O system you
      forgot the ) that closes the argument list. (Layers take care of
      transforming data between external and internal representations.) Perl
      stopped parsing the layer list at this point and did not attempt to push
      this layer. If your program didn't explicitly request the failing
      operation, it may be the result of the value of the environment variable
      PERLIO.</dd>
  <dt id="Array"><a class="permalink" href="#Array">Array @%s missing the @ in
    argument %d of %s()</a></dt>
  <dd>(D deprecated) Really old Perl let you omit the @ on array names in some
      spots. This is now heavily deprecated.</dd>
  <dt id="A"><a class="permalink" href="#A">A sequence of multiple spaces in a
    charnames alias definition is deprecated</a></dt>
  <dd>(D) You defined a character name which had multiple space characters in a
      row. Change them to single spaces. Usually these names are defined in the
      <span class="Li">&quot;:alias&quot;</span> import argument to
      <span class="Li">&quot;use charnames&quot;</span>, but they could be
      defined by a translator installed into
      <span class="Li">$^H{charnames}</span>. See &quot;CUSTOM ALIASES&quot; in
      charnames.</dd>
  <dt id="assertion"><a class="permalink" href="#assertion">assertion botched:
    %s</a></dt>
  <dd>(X) The malloc package that comes with Perl had an internal failure.</dd>
  <dt id="Assertion"><a class="permalink" href="#Assertion">Assertion failed:
    file &quot;%s&quot;</a></dt>
  <dd>(X) A general assertion failed. The file in question must be
    examined.</dd>
  <dt id="Assigning"><a class="permalink" href="#Assigning">Assigning non-zero
    to $[ is no longer possible</a></dt>
  <dd>(F) When the &quot;array_base&quot; feature is disabled (e.g., under
      <span class="Li">&quot;use v5.16;&quot;</span>) the special variable
      <span class="Li">$[</span>, which is deprecated, is now a fixed zero
      value.</dd>
  <dt id="Assignment"><a class="permalink" href="#Assignment">Assignment to both
    a list and a scalar</a></dt>
  <dd>(F) If you assign to a conditional operator, the 2nd and 3rd arguments
      must either both be scalars or both be lists. Otherwise Perl won't know
      which context to supply to the right side.</dd>
  <dt id="A~2"><a class="permalink" href="#A~2">A thread exited while %d threads
    were running</a></dt>
  <dd>(W threads)(S) When using threaded Perl, a thread (not necessarily the
      main thread) exited while there were still other threads running. Usually
      it's a good idea first to collect the return values of the created threads
      by joining them, and only then to exit from the main thread. See
    threads.</dd>
  <dt id="Attempt"><a class="permalink" href="#Attempt">Attempt to access
    disallowed key '%s' in a restricted hash</a></dt>
  <dd>(F) The failing code has attempted to get or set a key which is not in the
      current set of allowed keys of a restricted hash.</dd>
  <dt id="Attempt~2"><a class="permalink" href="#Attempt~2">Attempt to bless
    into a reference</a></dt>
  <dd>(F) The CLASSNAME argument to the <i>bless()</i> operator is expected to
      be the name of the package to bless the resulting object into. You've
      supplied instead a reference to something: perhaps you wrote
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    bless $self, $proto;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">when you intended</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    bless $self, ref($proto) || $proto;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If you actually want to bless into the stringified version of
        the reference supplied, you need to stringify it yourself, for example
        by:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    bless $self, &quot;$proto&quot;;
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt id="Attempt~3"><a class="permalink" href="#Attempt~3">Attempt to clear
    deleted array</a></dt>
  <dd>(S debugging) An array was assigned to when it was being freed. Freed
      values are not supposed to be visible to Perl code. This can also happen
      if XS code calls <span class="Li">&quot;av_clear&quot;</span> from a
      custom magic callback on the array.</dd>
  <dt id="Attempt~4"><a class="permalink" href="#Attempt~4">Attempt to delete
    disallowed key '%s' from a restricted hash</a></dt>
  <dd>(F) The failing code attempted to delete from a restricted hash a key
      which is not in its key set.</dd>
  <dt id="Attempt~5"><a class="permalink" href="#Attempt~5">Attempt to delete
    readonly key '%s' from a restricted hash</a></dt>
  <dd>(F) The failing code attempted to delete a key whose value has been
      declared readonly from a restricted hash.</dd>
  <dt id="Attempt~6"><a class="permalink" href="#Attempt~6">Attempt to free
    non-arena SV: 0x%x</a></dt>
  <dd>(S internal) All SV objects are supposed to be allocated from arenas that
      will be garbage collected on exit. An SV was discovered to be outside any
      of those arenas.</dd>
  <dt id="Attempt~7"><a class="permalink" href="#Attempt~7">Attempt to free
    nonexistent shared string '%s'%s</a></dt>
  <dd>(S internal) Perl maintains a reference-counted internal table of strings
      to optimize the storage and access of hash keys and other strings. This
      indicates someone tried to decrement the reference count of a string that
      can no longer be found in the table.</dd>
  <dt id="Attempt~8"><a class="permalink" href="#Attempt~8">Attempt to free temp
    prematurely: SV 0x%x</a></dt>
  <dd>(S debugging) Mortalized values are supposed to be freed by the
      <i>free_tmps()</i> routine. This indicates that something else is freeing
      the SV before the <i>free_tmps()</i> routine gets a chance, which means
      that the <i>free_tmps()</i> routine will be freeing an unreferenced scalar
      when it does try to free it.</dd>
  <dt id="Attempt~9"><a class="permalink" href="#Attempt~9">Attempt to free
    unreferenced glob pointers</a></dt>
  <dd>(S internal) The reference counts got screwed up on symbol aliases.</dd>
  <dt id="Attempt~10"><a class="permalink" href="#Attempt~10">Attempt to free
    unreferenced scalar: SV 0x%x</a></dt>
  <dd>(S internal) Perl went to decrement the reference count of a scalar to see
      if it would go to 0, and discovered that it had already gone to 0 earlier,
      and should have been freed, and in fact, probably was freed. This could
      indicate that <i>SvREFCNT_dec()</i> was called too many times, or that
      <i>SvREFCNT_inc()</i> was called too few times, or that the SV was
      mortalized when it shouldn't have been, or that memory has been
    corrupted.</dd>
  <dt id="Attempt~11"><a class="permalink" href="#Attempt~11">Attempt to join
    self</a></dt>
  <dd>(F) You tried to join a thread from within itself, which is an impossible
      task. You may be joining the wrong thread, or you may need to move the
      <i>join()</i> to some other thread.</dd>
  <dt id="Attempt~12"><a class="permalink" href="#Attempt~12">Attempt to pack
    pointer to temporary value</a></dt>
  <dd>(W pack) You tried to pass a temporary value (like the result of a
      function, or a computed expression) to the &quot;p&quot; <i>pack()</i>
      template. This means the result contains a pointer to a location that
      could become invalid anytime, even before the end of the current
      statement. Use literals or global values as arguments to the &quot;p&quot;
      <i>pack()</i> template to avoid this warning.</dd>
  <dt id="Attempt~13"><a class="permalink" href="#Attempt~13">Attempt to reload
    %s aborted.</a></dt>
  <dd>(F) You tried to load a file with <span class="Li">&quot;use&quot;</span>
      or <span class="Li">&quot;require&quot;</span> that failed to compile once
      already. Perl will not try to compile this file again unless you delete
      its entry from <span class="Li">%INC</span>. See &quot;require&quot; in
      perlfunc and &quot;%INC&quot; in perlvar.</dd>
  <dt id="Attempt~14"><a class="permalink" href="#Attempt~14">Attempt to set
    length of freed array</a></dt>
  <dd>(W misc) You tried to set the length of an array which has been freed. You
      can do this by storing a reference to the scalar representing the last
      index of an array and later assigning through that reference. For example
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    $r = do {my @a; \$#a};
    $$r = 503
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt id="Attempt~15"><a class="permalink" href="#Attempt~15">Attempt to use
    reference as lvalue in substr</a></dt>
  <dd>(W substr) You supplied a reference as the first argument to
      <i>substr()</i> used as an lvalue, which is pretty strange. Perhaps you
      forgot to dereference it first. See &quot;substr&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt id="Attribute"><a class="permalink" href="#Attribute">Attribute
    &quot;locked&quot; is deprecated</a></dt>
  <dd>(D deprecated) You have used the attributes pragma to modify the
      &quot;locked&quot; attribute on a code reference. The :locked attribute is
      obsolete, has had no effect since 5005 threads were removed, and will be
      removed in a future release of Perl 5.</dd>
  <dt id="Attribute~2"><a class="permalink" href="#Attribute~2">Attribute

      in a future release of Perl 5.</dd>
  <dt id="av_reify"><a class="permalink" href="#av_reify">av_reify called on

      Alternatively, if you are certain that you're calling the function

    stale stat buffer?</a></dt>
  <dd>(S) A warning peculiar to VMS. This arises because of the difference
      between access checks under VMS and under the Unix model Perl assumes.
      Under VMS, access checks are done by filename, rather than by bits in the
      stat buffer, so that ACLs and other protections can be taken into account.
      Unfortunately, Perl assumes that the stat buffer contains all the
      necessary information, and passes it, instead of the filespec, to the
      access-checking routine. It will try to retrieve the filespec using the
      device name and FID present in the stat buffer, but this works only if you
      haven't made a subsequent call to the CRTL <i>stat()</i> routine, because
      the device name is overwritten with each call. If this warning appears,
      the name lookup failed, and the access-checking routine gave up and
      returned FALSE, just to be conservative. (Note: The access-checking
      routine knows about the Perl <span class="Li">&quot;stat&quot;</span>
      operator and file tests, so you shouldn't ever see this warning in
      response to a Perl command; it arises only if some internal code takes

  <dd>(D deprecated) You used a declaration similar to <span class="Li">&quot;my

      causes a lexical variable not to be cleared at scope exit when its

      bug to achieve a kind of static variable. Since we intend to fix this bug,
      we don't want people relying on this behavior. You can achieve a similar
      static effect by declaring the variable in a separate block outside the
      function, eg
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    sub f { my $x if 0; return $x++ }

  <dd>(S syntax) The Perl lexer knows whether to expect a term or an operator.
      If it sees what it knows to be a term when it was expecting to see an

      inplace, but no files were given. This is usually a mistake, since editing
      STDIN inplace doesn't make sense, and can be confusing because it can make
      perl look like it is hanging when it is really just trying to read from
      STDIN. You should either pass a filename to edit, or remove

    brace on \N{} or unescaped left brace after \N</a></dt>
  <dd>(F) <span class="Li">&quot;\N&quot;</span> has two meanings.
    <p class="Pp">The traditional one has it followed by a name enclosed in
        braces, meaning the character (or sequence of characters) given by that
        name. Thus <span class="Li">&quot;\N{ASTERISK}&quot;</span> is another
        way of writing <span class="Li">&quot;*&quot;</span>, valid in both
        double-quoted strings and regular expression patterns. In patterns, it
        doesn't have the meaning an unescaped
        <span class="Li">&quot;*&quot;</span> does.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Starting in Perl 5.12.0,
        <span class="Li">&quot;\N&quot;</span> also can have an additional
        meaning (only) in patterns, namely to match a non-newline character.
        (This is short for <span class="Li">&quot;[^\n]&quot;</span>, and like
        <span class="Li">&quot;.&quot;</span> but is not affected by the
        <span class="Li">&quot;/s&quot;</span> regex modifier.)</p>
    <p class="Pp">This can lead to some ambiguities. When
        <span class="Li">&quot;\N&quot;</span> is not followed immediately by a
        left brace, Perl assumes the <span class="Li">&quot;[^\n]&quot;</span>
        meaning. Also, if the braces form a valid quantifier such as
        <span class="Li">&quot;\N{3}&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;\N{5,}&quot;</span>, Perl assumes that this means
        to match the given quantity of non-newlines (in these examples, 3; and 5
        or more, respectively). In all other case, where there is a
        <span class="Li">&quot;\N{&quot;</span> and a matching
        <span class="Li">&quot;}&quot;</span>, Perl assumes that a character
        name is desired.</p>
    <p class="Pp">However, if there is no matching
        <span class="Li">&quot;}&quot;</span>, Perl doesn't know if it was
        mistakenly omitted, or if <span class="Li">&quot;[^\n]{&quot;</span> was
        desired, and raises this error. If you meant the former, add the right
        brace; if you meant the latter, escape the brace with a backslash, like
        so: <span class="Li">&quot;\N\{&quot;</span></p>

      also being told to use the run-time locale, not Unicode. Instead, use a
      POSIX character class, which should know about the locale's rules. (See
      &quot;POSIX Character Classes&quot; in perlrecharclass.)
    <p class="Pp">Even if the run-time locale is ISO 8859-1 (Latin1), which is a
        subset of Unicode, some properties will give results that are not valid
        for that subset.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Here are a couple of examples to help you see what's going on.
        If the locale is ISO 8859-7, the character at code point 0xD7 is the
        &quot;GREEK CAPITAL LETTER CHI&quot;. But in Unicode that code point
        means the &quot;MULTIPLICATION SIGN&quot; instead, and
        <span class="Li">&quot;\p&quot;</span> always uses the Unicode meaning.
        That means that <span class="Li">&quot;\p{Alpha}&quot;</span> won't
        match, but <span class="Li">&quot;[[:alpha:]]&quot;</span> should. Only
        in the Latin1 locale are all the characters in the same positions as
        they are in Unicode. But, even here, some properties give incorrect
        results. An example is
        <span class="Li">&quot;\p{Changes_When_Uppercased}&quot;</span> which is
        true for &quot;LATIN SMALL LETTER Y WITH DIAERESIS&quot;, but since the
        upper case of that character is not in Latin1, in that locale it doesn't
        change when upper cased.</p>

  <dt id="Subroutine"><a class="permalink" href="#Subroutine">Subroutine
    &quot;&amp;%s&quot; is not available</a></dt>
  <dd>(W closure) During compilation, an inner named subroutine or eval is
      attempting to capture an outer lexical subroutine that is not currently
      available. This can happen for one of two reasons. First, the lexical
      subroutine may be declared in an outer anonymous subroutine that has not
      yet been created. (Remember that named subs are created at compile time,
      while anonymous subs are created at run-time.) For example,
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    sub { my sub a {...} sub f { \&amp;a } }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">At the time that f is created, it can't capture the current
        the &quot;a&quot; sub, since the anonymous subroutine hasn't been
        created yet. Conversely, the following won't give a warning since the
        anonymous subroutine has by now been created and is live:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    sub { my sub a {...} eval 'sub f { \&amp;a }' }-&gt;();
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The second situation is caused by an eval accessing a variable
        that has gone out of scope, for example,</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    sub f {
        my sub a {...}
        sub { eval '\&amp;a' }
    }
    f()-&gt;();
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Here, when the '\&amp;a' in the eval is being compiled, f() is
        not currently being executed, so its &amp;a is not available for
        capture.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>&quot;%s&quot; subroutine &amp;%s masks earlier declaration in same
    %s</dt>
  <dd>(W misc) A &quot;my&quot; or &quot;state&quot; subroutine has been
      redeclared in the current scope or statement, effectively eliminating all
      access to the previous instance. This is almost always a typographical
      error. Note that the earlier subroutine will still exist until the end of
      the scope or until all closure references to it are destroyed.</dd>
  <dt id="Subroutine~2"><a class="permalink" href="#Subroutine~2">Subroutine %s

    <p class="Pp">Often there will be another error message associated with the

        Occasionally the line number may be misleading, and once in a blue moon
        the only way to figure out what's triggering the error is to call

    <p class="Pp">If the Perl script is being executed as a command using the #!
        mechanism (or its local equivalent), this error can usually be fixed by
        editing the #! line so that the <b>-%c</b> option is a part of Perl's

    <p class="Pp">The simple rule is: Inheritance will not work when autoloading

  <dd>(W closure) During compilation, an inner named subroutine or eval is
      attempting to capture an outer lexical that is not currently available.
      This can happen for one of two reasons. First, the outer lexical may be
      declared in an outer anonymous subroutine that has not yet been created.
      (Remember that named subs are created at compile time, while anonymous
      subs are created at run-time.) For example,
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    sub { my $a; sub f { $a } }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">At the time that f is created, it can't capture the current
        value of <span class="Li">$a</span>, since the anonymous subroutine
        hasn't been created yet. Conversely, the following won't give a warning
        since the anonymous subroutine has by now been created and is live:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    sub { my $a; eval 'sub f { $a }' }-&gt;();
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The second situation is caused by an eval accessing a variable
        that has gone out of scope, for example,</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    sub f {
        my $a;
        sub { eval '$a' }
    }
    f()-&gt;();
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Here, when the '$a' in the eval is being compiled, f() is not

  <dt id="Within"><a class="permalink" href="#Within">Within []-length '%c' not
    allowed</a></dt>
  <dd>(F) The count in the (un)pack template may be replaced by
      <span class="Li">&quot;[TEMPLATE]&quot;</span> only if
      <span class="Li">&quot;TEMPLATE&quot;</span> always matches the same
      amount of packed bytes that can be determined from the template alone.
      This is not possible if it contains any of the codes @, /, U, u, w or a
      *-length. Redesign the template.</dd>
  <dt id="write()"><a class="permalink" href="#write()"><i>write()</i> on closed
    filehandle %s</a></dt>
  <dd>(W closed) The filehandle you're writing to got itself closed sometime
      before now. Check your control flow.</dd>
  <dt>%s &quot;\x%X&quot; does not map to Unicode</dt>
  <dd>(F) When reading in different encodings, Perl tries to map everything into
      Unicode characters. The bytes you read in are not legal in this encoding.
      For example
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    utf8 &quot;\xE4&quot; does not map to Unicode
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">if you try to read in the a-diaereses Latin-1 as UTF-8.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>'X' outside of string</dt>
  <dd>(F) You had a (un)pack template that specified a relative position before
      the beginning of the string being (un)packed. See &quot;pack&quot; in
      perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt>'x' outside of string in unpack</dt>
  <dd>(F) You had a pack template that specified a relative position after the
      end of the string being unpacked. See &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt id="YOU"><a class="permalink" href="#YOU">YOU HAVEN'T DISABLED SET-ID
    SCRIPTS IN THE KERNEL YET!</a></dt>
  <dd>(F) And you probably never will, because you probably don't have the
      sources to your kernel, and your vendor probably doesn't give a rip about
      what you want. Your best bet is to put a setuid C wrapper around your
      script.</dd>
  <dt id="You"><a class="permalink" href="#You">You need to quote
    &quot;%s&quot;</a></dt>
  <dd>(W syntax) You assigned a bareword as a signal handler name.
      Unfortunately, you already have a subroutine of that name declared, which
      means that Perl 5 will try to call the subroutine when the assignment is
      executed, which is probably not what you want. (If it IS what you want,
      put an &amp; in front.)</dd>
  <dt id="Your"><a class="permalink" href="#Your">Your random numbers are not
    that random</a></dt>
  <dd>(F) When trying to initialise the random seed for hashes, Perl could not
      get any randomness out of your system. This usually indicates Something
      Very Wrong.</dd>
