The Internet is a large and complex aggregation of network hardware, connected
  together by gateways. Tracking the route one's packets follow (or finding the
  miscreant gateway that's discarding your packets) can be difficult.
  <code class="Nm">traceroute</code> utilizes the IP protocol `time to live'
  field and attempts to elicit an ICMP <code class="Dv">TIME_EXCEEDED</code>
  response from each gateway along the path to some host.
<p class="Pp">The only mandatory parameter is the destination host name or IP
    number. The default probe datagram length is 40 bytes, but this may be
    increased by specifying a packet size (in bytes) after the destination host
    name.</p>
<p class="Pp">Other options are:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><a class="permalink" href="#a"><code class="Fl" id="a">-a</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Turn on AS# lookups for each hop encountered.</dd>

  <dd>Enable socket level debugging.</dd>
  <dt><a class="permalink" href="#D"><code class="Fl" id="D">-D</code></a></dt>
  <dd>When an ICMP response to our probe datagram is received, print the
      differences between the transmitted packet and the packet quoted by the
      ICMP response. A key showing the location of fields within the transmitted
      packet is printed, followed by the original packet in hex, followed by the
      quoted packet in hex. Bytes that are unchanged in the quoted packet are
      shown as underscores. Note, the IP checksum and the TTL of the quoted
      packet are not expected to match. By default, only one probe per hop is
      sent with this option.</dd>

      the <code class="Fl">-s</code> flag for another way to do this.)</dd>

    <var class="Ar">proto</var></dt>
  <dd>Send packets of specified IP protocol. The currently supported protocols
      are: UDP , TCP , GRE and ICMP Other protocols may also be specified
      (either by name or by number), though <code class="Nm">traceroute</code>
      does not implement any special knowledge of their packet formats. This
      option is useful for determining which router along a path may be blocking
      packets based on IP protocol number. But see BUGS below.</dd>

      <code class="Nm">traceroute</code> hopes that nothing is listening on UDP
      ports <i class="Em">base</i> to <i class="Em">base+nhops-1</i> at the
      destination host (so an ICMP <code class="Dv">PORT_UNREACHABLE</code>
      message will be returned to terminate the route tracing). If something is

  <dd>Bypass the normal routing tables and send directly to a host on an
      attached network. If the host is not on a directly-attached network, an
      error is returned. This option can be used to ping a local host through an
      interface that has no route through it (e.g., after the interface was
      dropped by <a class="Xr">routed(8)</a>).</dd>
  <dt><a class="permalink" href="#s"><code class="Fl" id="s">-s</code></a>

  <dd>Use the following IP address (which must be given as an IP number, not a
      hostname) as the source address in outgoing probe packets. On hosts with
      more than one IP address, this option can be used to force the source
      address to be something other than the IP address of the interface the
      probe packet is sent on. If the IP address is not one of this machine's
      interface addresses, an error is returned and nothing is sent. (See the
      <code class="Fl">-i</code> flag for another way to do this.)</dd>

  <dd>Set the <i class="Em">type-of-service</i> in probe packets to the
      following value (default zero). The value must be a decimal integer in the
      range 0 to 255. This option can be used to see if different
      types-of-service result in different paths. (If you are not running a
      <span class="Ux">4.4BSD</span> or later system, this may be academic since
      the normal network services like telnet and ftp don't let you control the
      <code class="Dv">TOS</code>). Not all values of
      <code class="Dv">TOS</code> are legal or meaningful - see the IP spec for
      definitions. Useful values are probably &#x2018;<code class="Li">-t
      16</code>&#x2019; (low delay) and &#x2018;<code class="Li">-t
      8</code>&#x2019; (high throughput).</dd>

  <dd>Verbose output. Received ICMP packets other than

      sec.).</dd>
  <dt><a class="permalink" href="#x"><code class="Fl" id="x">-x</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Toggle IP checksums. Normally, this prevents
      <code class="Nm">traceroute</code> from calculating IP checksums. In some
      cases, the operating system can overwrite parts of the outgoing packet but
      not recalculate the checksum (so in some cases the default is to not
      calculate checksums and using <code class="Fl">-x</code> causes them to be
      calculated). Note that checksums are usually required for the last hop
      when using ICMP ECHO probes ( <code class="Fl">-I</code> ). So they are
      always calculated when using ICMP.</dd>
  <dt><a class="permalink" href="#z"><code class="Fl" id="z">-z</code></a>
    <var class="Ar">pausemsecs</var></dt>
  <dd>Set the time (in milliseconds) to pause between probes (default 0). Some
      systems such as Solaris and routers such as Ciscos rate limit ICMP
      messages. A good value to use with this this is 500 (e.g. 1/2
    second).</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">This program attempts to trace the route an IP packet would follow
    to some internet host by launching UDP probe packets with a small ttl (time
    to live) then listening for an ICMP &quot;time exceeded&quot; reply from a
    gateway. We start our probes with a ttl of one and increase by one until we
    get an ICMP &quot;port unreachable&quot; (which means we got to
    &quot;host&quot;) or hit a max (which defaults to
    <i class="Em">net.inet.ip.ttl</i> hops &amp; can be changed with the
    <code class="Fl">-m</code> flag). Three probes (changed with
    <code class="Fl">-q</code> flag) are sent at each ttl setting and a line is
    printed showing the ttl, address of the gateway and round trip time of each
    probe. If the probe answers come from different gateways, the address of
    each responding system will be printed. If there is no response within a 5
    sec. timeout interval (changed with the <code class="Fl">-w</code> flag), a
    &quot;*&quot; is printed for that probe.</p>
<p class="Pp">We don't want the destination host to process the UDP probe
    packets so the destination port is set to an unlikely value (if some clod on
    the destination is using that value, it can be changed with the
    <code class="Fl">-p</code> flag).</p>

Note that lines 2 &amp; 3 are the same. This is due to a buggy kernel on the 2nd
  hop system - lbl-csam.arpa - that forwards packets with a zero ttl (a bug in

Note that the gateways 12, 14, 15, 16 &amp; 17 hops away either don't send ICMP
  &quot;time exceeded&quot; messages or send them with a ttl too small to reach
  us. 14 - 17 are running the MIT C Gateway code that doesn't send &quot;time
  exceeded&quot;s. God only knows what's going on with 12.
<p class="Pp">The silent gateway 12 in the above may be the result of a bug in
    the 4.[23] BSD network code (and its derivatives): 4.x (x &lt;= 3) sends an
    unreachable message using whatever ttl remains in the original datagram.
    Since, for gateways, the remaining ttl is zero, the ICMP &quot;time
    exceeded&quot; is guaranteed to not make it back to us. The behavior of this
    bug is slightly more interesting when it appears on the destination

</div>
Notice that there are 12 &quot;gateways&quot; (13 is the final destination) and
  exactly the last half of them are &quot;missing&quot;. What's really happening
  is that rip (a Sun-3 running Sun OS3.5) is using the ttl from our arriving
  datagram as the ttl in its ICMP reply. So, the reply will time out on the
  return path (with no notice sent to anyone since ICMP's aren't sent for
  ICMP's) until we probe with a ttl that's at least twice the path length. I.e.,
  rip is really only 7 hops away. A reply that returns with a ttl of 1 is a clue
  this problem exists. <code class="Nm">traceroute</code> prints a &quot;!&quot;
  after the time if the ttl is &lt;= 1. Since vendors ship a lot of obsolete
  (DEC&#x00B4;s Ultrix, Sun 3.x) or non-standard (HPUX) software, expect to see
  this problem frequently and/or take care picking the target host of your
  probes.
<p class="Pp">Other possible annotations after the time are
    <b class="Sy">!H</b>, <b class="Sy">!N</b>, or <b class="Sy">!P</b> (host,
    network or protocol unreachable), <b class="Sy">!S</b> (source route
    failed), (fragmentation needed - the RFC1191 Path MTU Discovery value is
    displayed), <b class="Sy">!U</b> or <b class="Sy">!W</b> (destination
    network/host unknown), <b class="Sy">!I</b> (source host is isolated),
    <b class="Sy">!A</b> (communication with destination network
    administratively prohibited), <b class="Sy">!Z</b> (communication with
    destination host administratively prohibited), <b class="Sy">!Q</b> (for
    this ToS the destination network is unreachable), <b class="Sy">!T</b> (for
    this ToS the destination host is unreachable), <b class="Sy">!X</b>
    (communication administratively prohibited), <b class="Sy">!V</b> (host
    precedence violation), <b class="Sy">!C</b> (precedence cutoff in effect),
    or <b class="Sy">!&lt;num&gt;</b> (ICMP unreachable code &lt;num&gt;). These
    are defined by RFC1812 (which supersedes RFC1716). If almost all the probes
    result in some kind of unreachable, <code class="Nm">traceroute</code> will
    give up and exit.</p>
<p class="Pp">This program is intended for use in network testing, measurement
    and management. It should be used primarily for manual fault isolation.
    Because of the load it could impose on the network, it is unwise to use
    <code class="Nm">traceroute</code> during normal operations or from
    automated scripts.</p>

When using protocols other than UDP, functionality is reduced. In particular,
  the last packet will often appear to be lost, because even though it reaches
  the destination host, there's no way to know that because no ICMP message is
  sent back. In the TCP case, <code class="Nm">traceroute</code> should listen
  for a RST from the destination host (or an intermediate router that's
  filtering packets), but this is not implemented yet.
<p class="Pp">The AS number capability reports information that may sometimes be
    inaccurate due to discrepancies between the contents of the routing database
    server and the current state of the Internet.</p>
