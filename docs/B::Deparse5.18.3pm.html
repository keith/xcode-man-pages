B::Deparse is a backend module for the Perl compiler that generates perl source
  code, based on the internal compiled structure that perl itself creates after
  parsing a program. The output of B::Deparse won't be exactly the same as the
  original source, since perl doesn't keep track of comments or whitespace, and
  there isn't a one-to-one correspondence between perl's syntactical
  constructions and their compiled form, but it will often be close. When you
  use the <b>-p</b> option, the output also includes parentheses even when they
  are not required by precedence, which can make it easy to see if perl is
  parsing your expressions the way you intended.
<p class="Pp">While B::Deparse goes to some lengths to try to figure out what
    your original program was doing, some parts of the language can still trip
    it up; it still fails even on some parts of Perl's own test suite. If you
    encounter a failure other than the most common ones described in the BUGS
    section below, you can help contribute to B::Deparse's ongoing development
    by submitting a bug report with a small example.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
As with all compiler backend options, these must follow directly after the
  '-MO=Deparse', separated by a comma but not any white space.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>-d</b></dt>
  <dd>Output data values (when they appear as constants) using Data::Dumper.
      Without this option, B::Deparse will use some simple routines of its own
      for the same purpose. Currently, Data::Dumper is better for some kinds of
      data (such as complex structures with sharing and self-reference) while
      the built-in routines are better for others (such as odd floating-point
      values).</dd>
  <dt><b>-f</b><i>FILE</i></dt>
  <dd>Normally, B::Deparse deparses the main code of a program, and all the subs
      defined in the same file. To include subs defined in other files, pass the
      <b>-f</b> option with the filename. You can pass the <b>-f</b> option
      several times, to include more than one secondary file. (Most of the time
      you don't want to use it at all.) You can also use this option to include
      subs which are defined in the scope of a <b>#line</b> directive with two
      parameters.</dd>
  <dt><b>-l</b></dt>
  <dd>Add '#line' declarations to the output based on the line and file
      locations of the original code.</dd>
  <dt><b>-p</b></dt>
  <dd>Print extra parentheses. Without this option, B::Deparse includes
      parentheses in its output only when they are needed, based on the
      structure of your program. With <b>-p</b>, it uses parentheses (almost)
      whenever they would be legal. This can be useful if you are used to LISP,
      or if you want to see how perl parses your input. If you say
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    if ($var &amp; 0x7f == 65) {print &quot;Gimme an A!&quot;}
    print ($which ? $a : $b), &quot;\n&quot;;
    $name = $ENV{USER} or &quot;Bob&quot;;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;B::Deparse,-p&quot;</span> will
      print</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    if (($var &amp; 0)) {
        print('Gimme an A!')
    };
    (print(($which ? $a : $b)), '???');
    (($name = $ENV{'USER'}) or '???')
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">which probably isn't what you intended (the
        <span class="Li">'???'</span> is a sign that perl optimized away a
        constant value).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>-P</b></dt>
  <dd>Disable prototype checking. With this option, all function calls are
      deparsed as if no prototype was defined for them. In other words,
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    perl -MO=Deparse,-P -e 'sub foo (\@) { 1 } foo @x'
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">will print</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    sub foo (\@) {
        1;
    }
    &amp;foo(\@x);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">making clear how the parameters are actually passed to
        <span class="Li">&quot;foo&quot;</span>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>-q</b></dt>
  <dd>Expand double-quoted strings into the corresponding combinations of
      concatenation, uc, ucfirst, lc, lcfirst, quotemeta, and join. For
      instance, print
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    print &quot;Hello, $world, @ladies, \u$gentlemen\E, \u\L$me!&quot;;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">as</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    print 'Hello, ' . $world . ', ' . join($&quot;, @ladies) . ', '
          . ucfirst($gentlemen) . ', ' . ucfirst(lc $me . '!');
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Note that the expanded form represents the way perl handles
        such constructions internally -- this option actually turns off the
        reverse translation that B::Deparse usually does. On the other hand,
        note that <span class="Li">&quot;$x = &quot;$y&quot;&quot;</span> is not
        the same as <span class="Li">&quot;$x = $y&quot;</span>: the former
        makes the value of <span class="Li">$y</span> into a string before doing
        the assignment.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>-s</b><i>LETTERS</i></dt>
  <dd>Tweak the style of B::Deparse's output. The letters should follow directly
      after the 's', with no space or punctuation. The following options are
      available:</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>C</b></dt>
  <dd>Cuddle <span class="Li">&quot;elsif&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;else&quot;</span>, and
      <span class="Li">&quot;continue&quot;</span> blocks. For example, print
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    if (...) {
         ...
    } else {
         ...
    }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">instead of</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    if (...) {
         ...
    }
    else {
         ...
    }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The default is not to cuddle.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>i</b><i>NUMBER</i></dt>
  <dd>Indent lines by multiples of <i>NUMBER</i> columns. The default is 4
      columns.</dd>
  <dt><b>T</b></dt>
  <dd>Use tabs for each 8 columns of indent. The default is to use only spaces.
      For instance, if the style options are <b>-si4T</b>, a line that's
      indented 3 times will be preceded by one tab and four spaces; if the
      options were <b>-si8T</b>, the same line would be preceded by three
    tabs.</dd>
  <dt><b>v</b><i>STRING</i><b>.</b></dt>
  <dd>Print <i>STRING</i> for the value of a constant that can't be determined
      because it was optimized away (mnemonic: this happens when a constant is
      used in <b>v</b>oid context). The end of the string is marked by a period.
      The string should be a valid perl expression, generally a constant. Note
      that unless it's a number, it probably needs to be quoted, and on a
      command line quotes need to be protected from the shell. Some conventional
      values include 0, 1, 42, '', 'foo', and 'Useless use of constant omitted'
      (which may need to be <b>-sv&quot;'Useless use of constant
      omitted'.&quot;</b> or something similar depending on your shell). The
      default is '???'. If you're using B::Deparse on a module or other file
      that's require'd, you shouldn't use a value that evaluates to false, since
      the customary true constant at the end of a module will be in void context
      when the file is compiled as a main program.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="Bd-indent"></div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>-x</b><i>LEVEL</i></dt>
  <dd>Expand conventional syntax constructions into equivalent ones that expose
      their internal operation. <i>LEVEL</i> should be a digit, with higher
      values meaning more expansion. As with <b>-q</b>, this actually involves
      turning off special cases in B::Deparse's normal operations.
    <p class="Pp">If <i>LEVEL</i> is at least 3,
        <span class="Li">&quot;for&quot;</span> loops will be translated into
        equivalent while loops with continue blocks; for instance</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    for ($i = 0; $i &lt; 10; ++$i) {
        print $i;

    while ($i &lt; 10) {
        print $i;
    } continue {
        ++$i
    }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Note that in a few cases this translation can't be perfectly
        carried back into the source code -- if the loop's initializer declares
        a my variable, for instance, it won't have the correct scope outside of
        the loop.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If <i>LEVEL</i> is at least 5,
        <span class="Li">&quot;use&quot;</span> declarations will be translated
        into <span class="Li">&quot;BEGIN&quot;</span> blocks containing calls
        to <span class="Li">&quot;require&quot;</span> and

  <li>The only pragmas to be completely supported are:
      <span class="Li">&quot;use warnings&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;use strict&quot;</span>, <span class="Li">&quot;use
      bytes&quot;</span>, <span class="Li">&quot;use integer&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;use feature&quot;</span>.
      (<span class="Li">$[</span>, which behaves like a pragma, is also
      supported.)
    <p class="Pp">Excepting those listed above, we're currently unable to
        guarantee that B::Deparse will produce a pragma at the correct point in
        the program. (Specifically, pragmas at the beginning of a block often
        appear right before the start of the block instead.) Since the effects
        of pragmas are often lexically scoped, this can mean that the pragma
        holds sway over a different portion of the program than in the input
        file.</p>
  </li>
  <li>In fact, the above is a specific instance of a more general problem: we
      can't guarantee to produce BEGIN blocks or
      <span class="Li">&quot;use&quot;</span> declarations in exactly the right
      place. So if you use a module which affects compilation (such as by
      over-riding keywords, overloading constants or whatever) then the output
      code might not work as intended.
    <p class="Pp">This is the most serious outstanding problem, and will require
        some help from the Perl core to fix.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Some constants don't print correctly either with or without <b>-d</b>. For
      instance, neither B::Deparse nor Data::Dumper know how to print
      dual-valued scalars correctly, as in:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    use constant E2BIG =&gt; ($!=7); $y = E2BIG; print $y, 0+$y;

    use constant H =&gt; { &quot;#&quot; =&gt; 1 }; H-&gt;{&quot;#&quot;};
    </pre>
  </li>
  <li>An input file that uses source filtering probably won't be deparsed into
      runnable code, because it will still include the <b>use</b> declaration
      for the source filtering module, even though the code that is produced is
      already ordinary Perl which shouldn't be filtered again.</li>
  <li>Optimised away statements are rendered as '???'. This includes statements
      that have a compile-time side-effect, such as the obscure
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    my $x if 0;

  <li>Lexical (my) variables declared in scopes external to a subroutine appear
      in code2ref output text as package variables. This is a tricky problem, as
      perl has no native facility for referring to a lexical variable defined
      within a different scope, although PadWalker is a good start.</li>
  <li>There are probably many more bugs on non-ASCII platforms (EBCDIC).</li>
  <li>Lexical <span class="Li">&quot;my&quot;</span> subroutines are not
      deparsed properly at the moment. They are emitted as pure declarations,
      without their body; and the declaration may appear in the wrong place
      (before any lexicals the body closes over, or before the
      <span class="Li">&quot;use feature&quot;</span> declaration that permits
      use of this feature).
    <p class="Pp">We expect to resolve this before the lexical-subroutine
        feature is no longer considered experimental.</p>

  <li>Lexical <span class="Li">&quot;state&quot;</span> subroutines are not
      deparsed at all at the moment.
