<p class="Pp">This document attempts to describe how to use the Perl API, as
    well as to provide some info on the basic workings of the Perl core. It is
    far from complete and probably contains many errors. Please refer any
    questions or comments to the author below.</p>

<p class="Pp">Perl has three typedefs that handle Perl's three main data
  types:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    SV  Scalar Value
    AV  Array Value
    HV  Hash Value
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Each typedef has specific routines that manipulate the various
    data types.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="What_is_an__"><a class="permalink" href="#What_is_an__">What
  is an &quot;IV&quot;?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Perl uses a special typedef IV which is a simple signed integer
    type that is guaranteed to be large enough to hold a pointer (as well as an
    integer). Additionally, there is the UV, which is simply an unsigned IV.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl also uses two special typedefs, I32 and I16, which will
    always be at least 32-bits and 16-bits long, respectively. (Again, there are
    U32 and U16, as well.) They will usually be exactly 32 and 16 bits long, but
    on Crays they will both be 64 bits.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Working_with_SVs"><a class="permalink" href="#Working_with_SVs">Working
  with SVs</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">An SV can be created and loaded with one command. There are five
    types of values that can be loaded: an integer value (IV), an unsigned
    integer value (UV), a double (NV), a string (PV), and another scalar (SV).
    (&quot;PV&quot; stands for &quot;Pointer Value&quot;. You might think that
    it is misnamed because it is described as pointing only to strings. However,
    it is possible to have it point to other things. For example, inversion
    lists, used in regular expression data structures, are scalars, each
    consisting of an array of UVs which are accessed through PVs. But, using it
    for non-strings requires care, as the underlying assumption of much of the
    internals is that PVs are just for strings. Often, for example, a trailing
    NUL is tacked on automatically. The non-string use is documented only in
    this paragraph.)</p>
<p class="Pp">The seven routines are:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    SV*  newSViv(IV);
    SV*  newSVuv(UV);
    SV*  newSVnv(double);
    SV*  newSVpv(const char*, STRLEN);
    SV*  newSVpvn(const char*, STRLEN);
    SV*  newSVpvf(const char*, ...);
    SV*  newSVsv(SV*);
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;STRLEN&quot;</span> is an integer type
    (Size_t, usually defined as size_t in <i>config.h</i>) guaranteed to be
    large enough to represent the size of any string that perl can handle.</p>
<p class="Pp">In the unlikely case of a SV requiring more complex
    initialisation, you can create an empty SV with newSV(len). If
    <span class="Li">&quot;len&quot;</span> is 0 an empty SV of type NULL is
    returned, else an SV of type PV is returned with len + 1 (for the NUL) bytes
    of storage allocated, accessible via SvPVX. In both cases the SV has the
    undef value.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    SV *sv = newSV(0);   /* no storage allocated  */
    SV *sv = newSV(10);  /* 10 (+1) bytes of uninitialised storage
                          * allocated */
</pre>
<p class="Pp">To change the value of an <i>already-existing</i> SV, there are
    eight routines:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    void  sv_setiv(SV*, IV);
    void  sv_setuv(SV*, UV);
    void  sv_setnv(SV*, double);
    void  sv_setpv(SV*, const char*);
    void  sv_setpvn(SV*, const char*, STRLEN)
    void  sv_setpvf(SV*, const char*, ...);
    void  sv_vsetpvfn(SV*, const char*, STRLEN, va_list *,
                                                    SV **, I32, bool *);
    void  sv_setsv(SV*, SV*);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Notice that you can choose to specify the length of the string to
    be assigned by using <span class="Li">&quot;sv_setpvn&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;newSVpvn&quot;</span>, or
    <span class="Li">&quot;newSVpv&quot;</span>, or you may allow Perl to
    calculate the length by using <span class="Li">&quot;sv_setpv&quot;</span>
    or by specifying 0 as the second argument to
    <span class="Li">&quot;newSVpv&quot;</span>. Be warned, though, that Perl
    will determine the string's length by using
    <span class="Li">&quot;strlen&quot;</span>, which depends on the string
    terminating with a NUL character, and not otherwise containing NULs.</p>
<p class="Pp">The arguments of <span class="Li">&quot;sv_setpvf&quot;</span> are
    processed like <span class="Li">&quot;sprintf&quot;</span>, and the
    formatted output becomes the value.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;sv_vsetpvfn&quot;</span> is an analogue of
    <span class="Li">&quot;vsprintf&quot;</span>, but it allows you to specify
    either a pointer to a variable argument list or the address and length of an
    array of SVs. The last argument points to a boolean; on return, if that
    boolean is true, then locale-specific information has been used to format
    the string, and the string's contents are therefore untrustworthy (see
    perlsec). This pointer may be NULL if that information is not important.
    Note that this function requires you to specify the length of the
  format.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;sv_set*()&quot;</span> functions are
    not generic enough to operate on values that have &quot;magic&quot;. See
    &quot;Magic Virtual Tables&quot; later in this document.</p>
<p class="Pp">All SVs that contain strings should be terminated with a NUL
    character. If it is not NUL-terminated there is a risk of core dumps and
    corruptions from code which passes the string to C functions or system calls
    which expect a NUL-terminated string. Perl's own functions typically add a
    trailing NUL for this reason. Nevertheless, you should be very careful when
    you pass a string stored in an SV to a C function or system call.</p>
<p class="Pp">To access the actual value that an SV points to, you can use the
    macros:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    SvIV(SV*)
    SvUV(SV*)
    SvNV(SV*)
    SvPV(SV*, STRLEN len)
    SvPV_nolen(SV*)
</pre>
<p class="Pp">which will automatically coerce the actual scalar type into an IV,
    UV, double, or string.</p>
<p class="Pp">In the <span class="Li">&quot;SvPV&quot;</span> macro, the length
    of the string returned is placed into the variable
    <span class="Li">&quot;len&quot;</span> (this is a macro, so you do
    <i>not</i> use <span class="Li">&amp;len</span>). If you do not care what
    the length of the data is, use the
    <span class="Li">&quot;SvPV_nolen&quot;</span> macro. Historically the
    <span class="Li">&quot;SvPV&quot;</span> macro with the global variable
    <span class="Li">&quot;PL_na&quot;</span> has been used in this case. But
    that can be quite inefficient because
    <span class="Li">&quot;PL_na&quot;</span> must be accessed in thread-local
    storage in threaded Perl. In any case, remember that Perl allows arbitrary
    strings of data that may both contain NULs and might not be terminated by a
    NUL.</p>
<p class="Pp">Also remember that C doesn't allow you to safely say
    <span class="Li">&quot;foo(SvPV(s, len),</span>
    <span class="Li">len);&quot;</span>. It might work with your compiler, but
    it won't work for everyone. Break this sort of statement up into separate
    assignments:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    SV *s;
    STRLEN len;
    char *ptr;
    ptr = SvPV(s, len);
    foo(ptr, len);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If you want to know if the scalar value is TRUE, you can use:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    SvTRUE(SV*)
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Although Perl will automatically grow strings for you, if you need
    to force Perl to allocate more memory for your SV, you can use the macro</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    SvGROW(SV*, STRLEN newlen)
</pre>
<p class="Pp">which will determine if more memory needs to be allocated. If so,
    it will call the function <span class="Li">&quot;sv_grow&quot;</span>. Note
    that <span class="Li">&quot;SvGROW&quot;</span> can only increase, not
    decrease, the allocated memory of an SV and that it does not automatically
    add space for the trailing NUL byte (perl's own string functions typically
    do <span class="Li">&quot;SvGROW(sv, len + 1)&quot;</span>).</p>
<p class="Pp">If you have an SV and want to know what kind of data Perl thinks
    is stored in it, you can use the following macros to check the type of SV
    you have.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    SvIOK(SV*)
    SvNOK(SV*)
    SvPOK(SV*)
</pre>
<p class="Pp">You can get and set the current length of the string stored in an
    SV with the following macros:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    SvCUR(SV*)
    SvCUR_set(SV*, I32 val)
</pre>
<p class="Pp">You can also get a pointer to the end of the string stored in the
    SV with the macro:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    SvEND(SV*)
</pre>
<p class="Pp">But note that these last three macros are valid only if
    <span class="Li">&quot;SvPOK()&quot;</span> is true.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you want to append something to the end of string stored in an
    <span class="Li">&quot;SV*&quot;</span>, you can use the following
    functions:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    void  sv_catpv(SV*, const char*);
    void  sv_catpvn(SV*, const char*, STRLEN);
    void  sv_catpvf(SV*, const char*, ...);
    void  sv_vcatpvfn(SV*, const char*, STRLEN, va_list *, SV **,
                                                             I32, bool);
    void  sv_catsv(SV*, SV*);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The first function calculates the length of the string to be
    appended by using <span class="Li">&quot;strlen&quot;</span>. In the second,
    you specify the length of the string yourself. The third function processes
    its arguments like <span class="Li">&quot;sprintf&quot;</span> and appends
    the formatted output. The fourth function works like
    <span class="Li">&quot;vsprintf&quot;</span>. You can specify the address
    and length of an array of SVs instead of the va_list argument. The fifth
    function extends the string stored in the first SV with the string stored in
    the second SV. It also forces the second SV to be interpreted as a
  string.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;sv_cat*()&quot;</span> functions are
    not generic enough to operate on values that have &quot;magic&quot;. See
    &quot;Magic Virtual Tables&quot; later in this document.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you know the name of a scalar variable, you can get a pointer
    to its SV by using the following:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    SV*  get_sv(&quot;package::varname&quot;, 0);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This returns NULL if the variable does not exist.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you want to know if this variable (or any other SV) is actually
    <span class="Li">&quot;defined&quot;</span>, you can call:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    SvOK(SV*)
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The scalar <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> value is
    stored in an SV instance called
    <span class="Li">&quot;PL_sv_undef&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Its address can be used whenever an
    <span class="Li">&quot;SV*&quot;</span> is needed. Make sure that you don't
    try to compare a random sv with <span class="Li">&amp;PL_sv_undef</span>.
    For example when interfacing Perl code, it'll work correctly for:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  foo(undef);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">But won't work when called as:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  $x = undef;
  foo($x);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">So to repeat always use <i>SvOK()</i> to check whether an sv is
    defined.</p>
<p class="Pp">Also you have to be careful when using
    <span class="Li">&amp;PL_sv_undef</span> as a value in AVs or HVs (see
    &quot;AVs, HVs and undefined values&quot;).</p>
<p class="Pp">There are also the two values
    <span class="Li">&quot;PL_sv_yes&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;PL_sv_no&quot;</span>, which contain boolean TRUE and
    FALSE values, respectively. Like
    <span class="Li">&quot;PL_sv_undef&quot;</span>, their addresses can be used
    whenever an <span class="Li">&quot;SV*&quot;</span> is needed.</p>
<p class="Pp">Do not be fooled into thinking that <span class="Li">&quot;(SV *)
    0&quot;</span> is the same as <span class="Li">&amp;PL_sv_undef</span>. Take
    this code:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    SV* sv = (SV*) 0;
    if (I-am-to-return-a-real-value) {
            sv = sv_2mortal(newSViv(42));
    }
    sv_setsv(ST(0), sv);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This code tries to return a new SV (which contains the value 42)
    if it should return a real value, or undef otherwise. Instead it has
    returned a NULL pointer which, somewhere down the line, will cause a
    segmentation violation, bus error, or just weird results. Change the zero to
    <span class="Li">&amp;PL_sv_undef</span> in the first line and all will be
    well.</p>
<p class="Pp">To free an SV that you've created, call
    <span class="Li">&quot;SvREFCNT_dec(SV*)&quot;</span>. Normally this call is
    not necessary (see &quot;Reference Counts and Mortality&quot;).</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Offsets"><a class="permalink" href="#Offsets">Offsets</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Perl provides the function
    <span class="Li">&quot;sv_chop&quot;</span> to efficiently remove characters
    from the beginning of a string; you give it an SV and a pointer to somewhere
    inside the PV, and it discards everything before the pointer. The efficiency
    comes by means of a little hack: instead of actually removing the
    characters, <span class="Li">&quot;sv_chop&quot;</span> sets the flag
    <span class="Li">&quot;OOK&quot;</span> (offset OK) to signal to other
    functions that the offset hack is in effect, and it puts the number of bytes
    chopped off into the IV field of the SV. It then moves the PV pointer
    (called <span class="Li">&quot;SvPVX&quot;</span>) forward that many bytes,
    and adjusts <span class="Li">&quot;SvCUR&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;SvLEN&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Hence, at this point, the start of the buffer that we allocated
    lives at <span class="Li">&quot;SvPVX(sv) - SvIV(sv)&quot;</span> in memory
    and the PV pointer is pointing into the middle of this allocated
  storage.</p>
<p class="Pp">This is best demonstrated by example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  % ./perl -Ilib -MDevel::Peek -le '$a=&quot;12345&quot;; $a=~s/.//; Dump($a)'
  SV = PVIV(0x8128450) at 0x81340f0
    REFCNT = 1
    FLAGS = (POK,OOK,pPOK)
    IV = 1  (OFFSET)
    PV = 0x8135781 ( &quot;1&quot; . ) &quot;2345&quot;\0
    CUR = 4
    LEN = 5
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Here the number of bytes chopped off (1) is put into IV, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;Devel::Peek::Dump&quot;</span> helpfully reminds us
    that this is an offset. The portion of the string between the
    &quot;real&quot; and the &quot;fake&quot; beginnings is shown in
    parentheses, and the values of <span class="Li">&quot;SvCUR&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;SvLEN&quot;</span> reflect the fake beginning, not
    the real one.</p>
<p class="Pp">Something similar to the offset hack is performed on AVs to enable
    efficient shifting and splicing off the beginning of the array; while
    <span class="Li">&quot;AvARRAY&quot;</span> points to the first element in
    the array that is visible from Perl,
    <span class="Li">&quot;AvALLOC&quot;</span> points to the real start of the
    C array. These are usually the same, but a
    <span class="Li">&quot;shift&quot;</span> operation can be carried out by
    increasing <span class="Li">&quot;AvARRAY&quot;</span> by one and decreasing
    <span class="Li">&quot;AvFILL&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;AvMAX&quot;</span>. Again, the location of the real
    start of the C array only comes into play when freeing the array. See
    <span class="Li">&quot;av_shift&quot;</span> in <i>av.c</i>.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="What's_Really_Stored_in_an_"><a class="permalink" href="#What's_Really_Stored_in_an_">What's
  Really Stored in an SV?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Recall that the usual method of determining the type of scalar you
    have is to use <span class="Li">&quot;Sv*OK&quot;</span> macros. Because a
    scalar can be both a number and a string, usually these macros will always
    return TRUE and calling the <span class="Li">&quot;Sv*V&quot;</span> macros
    will do the appropriate conversion of string to integer/double or
    integer/double to string.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you <i>really</i> need to know if you have an integer, double,
    or string pointer in an SV, you can use the following three macros
  instead:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    SvIOKp(SV*)
    SvNOKp(SV*)
    SvPOKp(SV*)
</pre>
<p class="Pp">These will tell you if you truly have an integer, double, or
    string pointer stored in your SV. The &quot;p&quot; stands for private.</p>
<p class="Pp">There are various ways in which the private and public flags may
    differ. For example, a tied SV may have a valid underlying value in the IV
    slot (so SvIOKp is true), but the data should be accessed via the FETCH
    routine rather than directly, so SvIOK is false. Another is when numeric
    conversion has occurred and precision has been lost: only the private flag
    is set on 'lossy' values. So when an NV is converted to an IV with loss,
    SvIOKp, SvNOKp and SvNOK will be set, while SvIOK wont be.</p>
<p class="Pp">In general, though, it's best to use the
    <span class="Li">&quot;Sv*V&quot;</span> macros.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Working_with_AVs"><a class="permalink" href="#Working_with_AVs">Working
  with AVs</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">There are two ways to create and load an AV. The first method
    creates an empty AV:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    AV*  newAV();
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The second method both creates the AV and initially populates it
    with SVs:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    AV*  av_make(I32 num, SV **ptr);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The second argument points to an array containing
    <span class="Li">&quot;num&quot;</span>
    <span class="Li">&quot;SV*&quot;</span>'s. Once the AV has been created, the
    SVs can be destroyed, if so desired.</p>
<p class="Pp">Once the AV has been created, the following operations are
    possible on it:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    void  av_push(AV*, SV*);
    SV*   av_pop(AV*);
    SV*   av_shift(AV*);
    void  av_unshift(AV*, I32 num);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">These should be familiar operations, with the exception of
    <span class="Li">&quot;av_unshift&quot;</span>. This routine adds
    <span class="Li">&quot;num&quot;</span> elements at the front of the array
    with the <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> value. You must then use
    <span class="Li">&quot;av_store&quot;</span> (described below) to assign
    values to these new elements.</p>
<p class="Pp">Here are some other functions:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    I32   av_top_index(AV*);
    SV**  av_fetch(AV*, I32 key, I32 lval);
    SV**  av_store(AV*, I32 key, SV* val);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;av_top_index&quot;</span> function
    returns the highest index value in an array (just like $#array in Perl). If
    the array is empty, -1 is returned. The
    <span class="Li">&quot;av_fetch&quot;</span> function returns the value at
    index <span class="Li">&quot;key&quot;</span>, but if
    <span class="Li">&quot;lval&quot;</span> is non-zero, then
    <span class="Li">&quot;av_fetch&quot;</span> will store an undef value at
    that index. The <span class="Li">&quot;av_store&quot;</span> function stores
    the value <span class="Li">&quot;val&quot;</span> at index
    <span class="Li">&quot;key&quot;</span>, and does not increment the
    reference count of <span class="Li">&quot;val&quot;</span>. Thus the caller
    is responsible for taking care of that, and if
    <span class="Li">&quot;av_store&quot;</span> returns NULL, the caller will
    have to decrement the reference count to avoid a memory leak. Note that
    <span class="Li">&quot;av_fetch&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;av_store&quot;</span> both return
    <span class="Li">&quot;SV**&quot;</span>'s, not
    <span class="Li">&quot;SV*&quot;</span>'s as their return value.</p>
<p class="Pp">A few more:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    void  av_clear(AV*);

<h2 class="Ss" id="Working_with_HVs"><a class="permalink" href="#Working_with_HVs">Working
  with HVs</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">To create an HV, you use the following routine:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    HV*  newHV();
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Once the HV has been created, the following operations are
    possible on it:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    SV**  hv_store(HV*, const char* key, U32 klen, SV* val, U32 hash);
    SV**  hv_fetch(HV*, const char* key, U32 klen, I32 lval);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;klen&quot;</span> parameter is the
    length of the key being passed in (Note that you cannot pass 0 in as a value
    of <span class="Li">&quot;klen&quot;</span> to tell Perl to measure the
    length of the key). The <span class="Li">&quot;val&quot;</span> argument
    contains the SV pointer to the scalar being stored, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;hash&quot;</span> is the precomputed hash value (zero
    if you want <span class="Li">&quot;hv_store&quot;</span> to calculate it for
    you). The <span class="Li">&quot;lval&quot;</span> parameter indicates
    whether this fetch is actually a part of a store operation, in which case a
    new undefined value will be added to the HV with the supplied key and
    <span class="Li">&quot;hv_fetch&quot;</span> will return as if the value had
    already existed.</p>
<p class="Pp">Remember that <span class="Li">&quot;hv_store&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;hv_fetch&quot;</span> return
    <span class="Li">&quot;SV**&quot;</span>'s and not just
    <span class="Li">&quot;SV*&quot;</span>. To access the scalar value, you
    must first dereference the return value. However, you should check to make
    sure that the return value is not NULL before dereferencing it.</p>
<p class="Pp">The first of these two functions checks if a hash table entry
    exists, and the second deletes it.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    bool  hv_exists(HV*, const char* key, U32 klen);
    SV*   hv_delete(HV*, const char* key, U32 klen, I32 flags);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If <span class="Li">&quot;flags&quot;</span> does not include the
    <span class="Li">&quot;G_DISCARD&quot;</span> flag then
    <span class="Li">&quot;hv_delete&quot;</span> will create and return a
    mortal copy of the deleted value.</p>
<p class="Pp">And more miscellaneous functions:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    void   hv_clear(HV*);
    void   hv_undef(HV*);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Like their AV counterparts,
    <span class="Li">&quot;hv_clear&quot;</span> deletes all the entries in the
    hash table but does not actually delete the hash table. The
    <span class="Li">&quot;hv_undef&quot;</span> deletes both the entries and
    the hash table itself.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl keeps the actual data in a linked list of structures with a
    typedef of HE. These contain the actual key and value pointers (plus extra
    administrative overhead). The key is a string pointer; the value is an
    <span class="Li">&quot;SV*&quot;</span>. However, once you have an
    <span class="Li">&quot;HE*&quot;</span>, to get the actual key and value,
    use the routines specified below.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    I32    hv_iterinit(HV*);
            /* Prepares starting point to traverse hash table */
    HE*    hv_iternext(HV*);
            /* Get the next entry, and return a pointer to a
               structure that has both the key and value */
    char*  hv_iterkey(HE* entry, I32* retlen);
            /* Get the key from an HE structure and also return
               the length of the key string */
    SV*    hv_iterval(HV*, HE* entry);
            /* Return an SV pointer to the value of the HE
               structure */
    SV*    hv_iternextsv(HV*, char** key, I32* retlen);
            /* This convenience routine combines hv_iternext,
               hv_iterkey, and hv_iterval.  The key and retlen
               arguments are return values for the key and its
               length.  The value is returned in the SV* argument */
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If you know the name of a hash variable, you can get a pointer to
    its HV by using the following:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    HV*  get_hv(&quot;package::varname&quot;, 0);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This returns NULL if the variable does not exist.</p>
<p class="Pp">The hash algorithm is defined in the
    <span class="Li">&quot;PERL_HASH&quot;</span> macro:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    PERL_HASH(hash, key, klen)
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The exact implementation of this macro varies by architecture and
    version of perl, and the return value may change per invocation, so the
    value is only valid for the duration of a single perl process.</p>

<p class="Pp">Note that these functions take
    <span class="Li">&quot;SV*&quot;</span> keys, which simplifies writing of
    extension code that deals with hash structures. These functions also allow
    passing of <span class="Li">&quot;SV*&quot;</span> keys to
    <span class="Li">&quot;tie&quot;</span> functions without forcing you to
    stringify the keys (unlike the previous set of functions).</p>
<p class="Pp">They also return and accept whole hash entries
    (<span class="Li">&quot;HE*&quot;</span>), making their use more efficient
    (since the hash number for a particular string doesn't have to be recomputed
    every time). See perlapi for detailed descriptions.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following macros must always be used to access the contents of

<h2 class="Ss" id="AVs,_HVs_and_undefined_values"><a class="permalink" href="#AVs,_HVs_and_undefined_values">AVs,
  HVs and undefined values</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Sometimes you have to store undefined values in AVs or HVs.
    Although this may be a rare case, it can be tricky. That's because you're
    used to using <span class="Li">&amp;PL_sv_undef</span> if you need an
    undefined SV.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, intuition tells you that this XS code:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    AV *av = newAV();
    av_store( av, 0, &amp;PL_sv_undef );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">is equivalent to this Perl code:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    my @av;
    $av[0] = undef;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Unfortunately, this isn't true. AVs use
    <span class="Li">&amp;PL_sv_undef</span> as a marker for indicating that an
    array element has not yet been initialized. Thus,
    <span class="Li">&quot;exists $av[0]&quot;</span> would be true for the
    above Perl code, but false for the array generated by the XS code.</p>
<p class="Pp">Other problems can occur when storing
    <span class="Li">&amp;PL_sv_undef</span> in HVs:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    hv_store( hv, &quot;key&quot;, 3, &amp;PL_sv_undef, 0 );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This will indeed make the value
    <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span>, but if you try to modify the
    value of <span class="Li">&quot;key&quot;</span>, you'll get the following
    error:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    Modification of non-creatable hash value attempted
</pre>
<p class="Pp">In perl 5.8.0, <span class="Li">&amp;PL_sv_undef</span> was also
    used to mark placeholders in restricted hashes. This caused such hash
    entries not to appear when iterating over the hash or when checking for the
    keys with the <span class="Li">&quot;hv_exists&quot;</span> function.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can run into similar problems when you store
    <span class="Li">&amp;PL_sv_yes</span> or
    <span class="Li">&amp;PL_sv_no</span> into AVs or HVs. Trying to modify such
    elements will give you the following error:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    Modification of a read-only value attempted
</pre>
<p class="Pp">To make a long story short, you can use the special variables
    <span class="Li">&amp;PL_sv_undef</span>,
    <span class="Li">&amp;PL_sv_yes</span> and
    <span class="Li">&amp;PL_sv_no</span> with AVs and HVs, but you have to make
    sure you know what you're doing.</p>
<p class="Pp">Generally, if you want to store an undefined value in an AV or HV,
    you should not use <span class="Li">&amp;PL_sv_undef</span>, but rather
    create a new undefined value using the
    <span class="Li">&quot;newSV&quot;</span> function, for example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    av_store( av, 42, newSV(0) );
    hv_store( hv, &quot;foo&quot;, 3, newSV(0), 0 );

<h2 class="Ss" id="Reference_Counts_and_Mortality"><a class="permalink" href="#Reference_Counts_and_Mortality">Reference
  Counts and Mortality</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Perl uses a reference count-driven garbage collection mechanism.
    SVs, AVs, or HVs (xV for short in the following) start their life with a
    reference count of 1. If the reference count of an xV ever drops to 0, then
    it will be destroyed and its memory made available for reuse.</p>
<p class="Pp">This normally doesn't happen at the Perl level unless a variable
    is undef'ed or the last variable holding a reference to it is changed or
    overwritten. At the internal level, however, reference counts can be
    manipulated with the following macros:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    int SvREFCNT(SV* sv);
    SV* SvREFCNT_inc(SV* sv);
    void SvREFCNT_dec(SV* sv);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">However, there is one other function which manipulates the
    reference count of its argument. The
    <span class="Li">&quot;newRV_inc&quot;</span> function, you will recall,
    creates a reference to the specified argument. As a side effect, it
    increments the argument's reference count. If this is not what you want, use
    <span class="Li">&quot;newRV_noinc&quot;</span> instead.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, imagine you want to return a reference from an XSUB
    function. Inside the XSUB routine, you create an SV which initially has a
    reference count of one. Then you call
    <span class="Li">&quot;newRV_inc&quot;</span>, passing it the just-created
    SV. This returns the reference as a new SV, but the reference count of the
    SV you passed to <span class="Li">&quot;newRV_inc&quot;</span> has been
    incremented to two. Now you return the reference from the XSUB routine and
    forget about the SV. But Perl hasn't! Whenever the returned reference is
    destroyed, the reference count of the original SV is decreased to one and
    nothing happens. The SV will hang around without any way to access it until
    Perl itself terminates. This is a memory leak.</p>
<p class="Pp">The correct procedure, then, is to use
    <span class="Li">&quot;newRV_noinc&quot;</span> instead of
    <span class="Li">&quot;newRV_inc&quot;</span>. Then, if and when the last
    reference is destroyed, the reference count of the SV will go to zero and it
    will be destroyed, stopping any memory leak.</p>
<p class="Pp">There are some convenience functions available that can help with
    the destruction of xVs. These functions introduce the concept of
    &quot;mortality&quot;. An xV that is mortal has had its reference count
    marked to be decremented, but not actually decremented, until &quot;a short
    time later&quot;. Generally the term &quot;short time later&quot; means a
    single Perl statement, such as a call to an XSUB function. The actual
    determinant for when mortal xVs have their reference count decremented
    depends on two macros, SAVETMPS and FREETMPS. See perlcall and perlxs for
    more details on these macros.</p>
<p class="Pp">&quot;Mortalization&quot; then is at its simplest a deferred
    <span class="Li">&quot;SvREFCNT_dec&quot;</span>. However, if you mortalize
    a variable twice, the reference count will later be decremented twice.</p>
<p class="Pp">&quot;Mortal&quot; SVs are mainly used for SVs that are placed on
    perl's stack. For example an SV which is created just to pass a number to a
    called sub is made mortal to have it cleaned up automatically when it's
    popped off the stack. Similarly, results returned by XSUBs (which are pushed
    on the stack) are often made mortal.</p>
<p class="Pp">To create a mortal variable, use the functions:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    SV*  sv_newmortal()
    SV*  sv_2mortal(SV*)
    SV*  sv_mortalcopy(SV*)
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The first call creates a mortal SV (with no value), the second
    converts an existing SV to a mortal SV (and thus defers a call to
    <span class="Li">&quot;SvREFCNT_dec&quot;</span>), and the third creates a
    mortal copy of an existing SV. Because
    <span class="Li">&quot;sv_newmortal&quot;</span> gives the new SV no value,
    it must normally be given one via

<pre>    SV *tmp = sv_newmortal();

<p class="Pp">As that is multiple C statements it is quite common so see this
    idiom instead:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    SV *tmp = sv_2mortal(newSViv(an_integer));
</pre>
<p class="Pp">You should be careful about creating mortal variables. Strange
    things can happen if you make the same value mortal within multiple
    contexts, or if you make a variable mortal multiple times. Thinking of
    &quot;Mortalization&quot; as deferred
    <span class="Li">&quot;SvREFCNT_dec&quot;</span> should help to minimize
    such problems. For example if you are passing an SV which you <i>know</i>
    has a high enough REFCNT to survive its use on the stack you need not do any
    mortalization. If you are not sure then doing an
    <span class="Li">&quot;SvREFCNT_inc&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;sv_2mortal&quot;</span>, or making a
    <span class="Li">&quot;sv_mortalcopy&quot;</span> is safer.</p>
<p class="Pp">The mortal routines are not just for SVs; AVs and HVs can be made
    mortal by passing their address (type-casted to
    <span class="Li">&quot;SV*&quot;</span>) to the
    <span class="Li">&quot;sv_2mortal&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;sv_mortalcopy&quot;</span> routines.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Stashes_and_Globs"><a class="permalink" href="#Stashes_and_Globs">Stashes
  and Globs</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">A <b>stash</b> is a hash that contains all variables that are
    defined within a package. Each key of the stash is a symbol name (shared by
    all the different types of objects that have the same name), and each value
    in the hash table is a GV (Glob Value). This GV in turn contains references
    to the various objects of that name, including (but not limited to) the
    following:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    Scalar Value
    Array Value
    Hash Value
    I/O Handle
    Format
    Subroutine
</pre>
<p class="Pp">There is a single stash called
    <span class="Li">&quot;PL_defstash&quot;</span> that holds the items that
    exist in the <span class="Li">&quot;main&quot;</span> package. To get at the
    items in other packages, append the string &quot;::&quot; to the package
    name. The items in the <span class="Li">&quot;Foo&quot;</span> package are
    in the stash <span class="Li">&quot;Foo::&quot;</span> in PL_defstash. The
    items in the <span class="Li">&quot;Bar::Baz&quot;</span> package are in the
    stash <span class="Li">&quot;Baz::&quot;</span> in
    <span class="Li">&quot;Bar::&quot;</span>'s stash.</p>
<p class="Pp">To get the stash pointer for a particular package, use the
    function:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    HV*  gv_stashpv(const char* name, I32 flags)
    HV*  gv_stashsv(SV*, I32 flags)
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The first function takes a literal string, the second uses the
    string stored in the SV. Remember that a stash is just a hash table, so you
    get back an <span class="Li">&quot;HV*&quot;</span>. The
    <span class="Li">&quot;flags&quot;</span> flag will create a new package if
    it is set to GV_ADD.</p>
<p class="Pp">The name that <span class="Li">&quot;gv_stash*v&quot;</span> wants
    is the name of the package whose symbol table you want. The default package
    is called <span class="Li">&quot;main&quot;</span>. If you have multiply
    nested packages, pass their names to
    <span class="Li">&quot;gv_stash*v&quot;</span>, separated by
    <span class="Li">&quot;::&quot;</span> as in the Perl language itself.</p>
<p class="Pp">Alternately, if you have an SV that is a blessed reference, you
    can find out the stash pointer by using:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    HV*  SvSTASH(SvRV(SV*));
</pre>
<p class="Pp">then use the following to get the package name itself:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    char*  HvNAME(HV* stash);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If you need to bless or re-bless an object you can use the
    following function:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    SV*  sv_bless(SV*, HV* stash)
</pre>
<p class="Pp">where the first argument, an
    <span class="Li">&quot;SV*&quot;</span>, must be a reference, and the second
    argument is a stash. The returned <span class="Li">&quot;SV*&quot;</span>
    can now be used in the same way as any other SV.</p>
<p class="Pp">For more information on references and blessings, consult
  perlref.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Double-Typed_SVs"><a class="permalink" href="#Double-Typed_SVs">Double-Typed
  SVs</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Scalar variables normally contain only one type of value, an
    integer, double, pointer, or reference. Perl will automatically convert the
    actual scalar data from the stored type into the requested type.</p>
<p class="Pp">Some scalar variables contain more than one type of scalar data.
    For example, the variable <span class="Li">$!</span> contains either the
    numeric value of <span class="Li">&quot;errno&quot;</span> or its string
    equivalent from either <span class="Li">&quot;strerror&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;sys_errlist[]&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">To force multiple data values into an SV, you must do two things:
    use the <span class="Li">&quot;sv_set*v&quot;</span> routines to add the
    additional scalar type, then set a flag so that Perl will believe it
    contains more than one type of data. The four macros to set the flags
  are:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        SvIOK_on
        SvNOK_on
        SvPOK_on
        SvROK_on
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The particular macro you must use depends on which
    <span class="Li">&quot;sv_set*v&quot;</span> routine you called first. This
    is because every <span class="Li">&quot;sv_set*v&quot;</span> routine turns
    on only the bit for the particular type of data being set, and turns off all
    the rest.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, to create a new Perl variable called
    &quot;dberror&quot; that contains both the numeric and descriptive string
    error values, you could use the following code:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    extern int  dberror;
    extern char *dberror_list;
    SV* sv = get_sv(&quot;dberror&quot;, GV_ADD);
    sv_setiv(sv, (IV) dberror);
    sv_setpv(sv, dberror_list[dberror]);
    SvIOK_on(sv);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If the order of <span class="Li">&quot;sv_setiv&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;sv_setpv&quot;</span> had been reversed, then the
    macro <span class="Li">&quot;SvPOK_on&quot;</span> would need to be called
    instead of <span class="Li">&quot;SvIOK_on&quot;</span>.</p>

<p class="Pp">Any SV may be magical, that is, it has special features that a

<h2 class="Ss" id="Assigning_Magic"><a class="permalink" href="#Assigning_Magic">Assigning
  Magic</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Perl adds magic to an SV using the sv_magic function:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  void sv_magic(SV* sv, SV* obj, int how, const char* name, I32 namlen);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;sv&quot;</span> argument is a pointer
    to the SV that is to acquire a new magical feature.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <span class="Li">&quot;sv&quot;</span> is not already magical,
    Perl uses the <span class="Li">&quot;SvUPGRADE&quot;</span> macro to convert
    <span class="Li">&quot;sv&quot;</span> to type
    <span class="Li">&quot;SVt_PVMG&quot;</span>. Perl then continues by adding
    new magic to the beginning of the linked list of magical features. Any prior
    entry of the same type of magic is deleted. Note that this can be
    overridden, and multiple instances of the same type of magic can be
    associated with an SV.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;name&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;namlen&quot;</span> arguments are used to associate a
    string with the magic, typically the name of a variable.
    <span class="Li">&quot;namlen&quot;</span> is stored in the
    <span class="Li">&quot;mg_len&quot;</span> field and if
    <span class="Li">&quot;name&quot;</span> is non-null then either a
    <span class="Li">&quot;savepvn&quot;</span> copy of
    <span class="Li">&quot;name&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;name&quot;</span> itself is stored in the
    <span class="Li">&quot;mg_ptr&quot;</span> field, depending on whether
    <span class="Li">&quot;namlen&quot;</span> is greater than zero or equal to
    zero respectively. As a special case, if <span class="Li">&quot;(name
    &amp;&amp; namlen == HEf_SVKEY)&quot;</span> then
    <span class="Li">&quot;name&quot;</span> is assumed to contain an
    <span class="Li">&quot;SV*&quot;</span> and is stored as-is with its REFCNT
    incremented.</p>
<p class="Pp">The sv_magic function uses <span class="Li">&quot;how&quot;</span>
    to determine which, if any, predefined &quot;Magic Virtual Table&quot;
    should be assigned to the <span class="Li">&quot;mg_virtual&quot;</span>
    field. See the &quot;Magic Virtual Tables&quot; section below. The
    <span class="Li">&quot;how&quot;</span> argument is also stored in the
    <span class="Li">&quot;mg_type&quot;</span> field. The value of
    <span class="Li">&quot;how&quot;</span> should be chosen from the set of
    macros <span class="Li">&quot;PERL_MAGIC_foo&quot;</span> found in
    <i>perl.h</i>. Note that before these macros were added, Perl internals used
    to directly use character literals, so you may occasionally come across old
    code or documentation referring to 'U' magic rather than
    <span class="Li">&quot;PERL_MAGIC_uvar&quot;</span> for example.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;obj&quot;</span> argument is stored in
    the <span class="Li">&quot;mg_obj&quot;</span> field of the
    <span class="Li">&quot;MAGIC&quot;</span> structure. If it is not the same
    as the <span class="Li">&quot;sv&quot;</span> argument, the reference count
    of the <span class="Li">&quot;obj&quot;</span> object is incremented. If it
    is the same, or if the <span class="Li">&quot;how&quot;</span> argument is
    <span class="Li">&quot;PERL_MAGIC_arylen&quot;</span>, or if it is a NULL
    pointer, then <span class="Li">&quot;obj&quot;</span> is merely stored,
    without the reference count being incremented.</p>
<p class="Pp">See also <span class="Li">&quot;sv_magicext&quot;</span> in
    perlapi for a more flexible way to add magic to an SV.</p>
<p class="Pp">There is also a function to add magic to an
    <span class="Li">&quot;HV&quot;</span>:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    void hv_magic(HV *hv, GV *gv, int how);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This simply calls <span class="Li">&quot;sv_magic&quot;</span> and
    coerces the <span class="Li">&quot;gv&quot;</span> argument into an
    <span class="Li">&quot;SV&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">To remove the magic from an SV, call the function sv_unmagic:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    int sv_unmagic(SV *sv, int type);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;type&quot;</span> argument should be
    equal to the <span class="Li">&quot;how&quot;</span> value when the
    <span class="Li">&quot;SV&quot;</span> was initially made magical.</p>
<p class="Pp">However, note that <span class="Li">&quot;sv_unmagic&quot;</span>
    removes all magic of a certain <span class="Li">&quot;type&quot;</span> from
    the <span class="Li">&quot;SV&quot;</span>. If you want to remove only
    certain magic of a <span class="Li">&quot;type&quot;</span> based on the
    magic virtual table, use <span class="Li">&quot;sv_unmagicext&quot;</span>
    instead:</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Magic_Virtual_Tables"><a class="permalink" href="#Magic_Virtual_Tables">Magic
  Virtual Tables</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;mg_virtual&quot;</span> field in the
    <span class="Li">&quot;MAGIC&quot;</span> structure is a pointer to an
    <span class="Li">&quot;MGVTBL&quot;</span>, which is a structure of function
    pointers and stands for &quot;Magic Virtual Table&quot; to handle the
    various operations that might be applied to that variable.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;MGVTBL&quot;</span> has five (or
    sometimes eight) pointers to the following routine types:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    int  (*svt_get)(SV* sv, MAGIC* mg);
    int  (*svt_set)(SV* sv, MAGIC* mg);
    U32  (*svt_len)(SV* sv, MAGIC* mg);
    int  (*svt_clear)(SV* sv, MAGIC* mg);
    int  (*svt_free)(SV* sv, MAGIC* mg);
    int  (*svt_copy)(SV *sv, MAGIC* mg, SV *nsv,
                                          const char *name, I32 namlen);
    int  (*svt_dup)(MAGIC *mg, CLONE_PARAMS *param);
    int  (*svt_local)(SV *nsv, MAGIC *mg);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This MGVTBL structure is set at compile-time in <i>perl.h</i> and
    there are currently 32 types. These different structures contain pointers to
    various routines that perform additional actions depending on which function
    is being called.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>   Function pointer    Action taken
   ----------------    ------------
   svt_get             Do something before the value of the SV is
                       retrieved.
   svt_set             Do something after the SV is assigned a value.
   svt_len             Report on the SV's length.
   svt_clear           Clear something the SV represents.
   svt_free            Free any extra storage associated with the SV.
   svt_copy            copy tied variable magic to a tied element
   svt_dup             duplicate a magic structure during thread cloning
   svt_local           copy magic to local value during 'local'
</pre>
<p class="Pp">For instance, the MGVTBL structure called
    <span class="Li">&quot;vtbl_sv&quot;</span> (which corresponds to an
    <span class="Li">&quot;mg_type&quot;</span> of
    <span class="Li">&quot;PERL_MAGIC_sv&quot;</span>) contains:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    { magic_get, magic_set, magic_len, 0, 0 }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Thus, when an SV is determined to be magical and of type
    <span class="Li">&quot;PERL_MAGIC_sv&quot;</span>, if a get operation is
    being performed, the routine <span class="Li">&quot;magic_get&quot;</span>
    is called. All the various routines for the various magical types begin with
    <span class="Li">&quot;magic_&quot;</span>. NOTE: the magic routines are not
    considered part of the Perl API, and may not be exported by the Perl
    library.</p>
<p class="Pp">The last three slots are a recent addition, and for source code
    compatibility they are only checked for if one of the three flags MGf_COPY,
    MGf_DUP or MGf_LOCAL is set in mg_flags. This means that most code can
    continue declaring a vtable as a 5-element value. These three are currently
    used exclusively by the threading code, and are highly subject to
  change.</p>

    to 'attach' private information to variables (typically objects). This is
    especially useful because there is no way for normal perl code to corrupt
    this private information (unlike using extra elements of a hash object).</p>
<p class="Pp">Similarly, <span class="Li">&quot;PERL_MAGIC_uvar&quot;</span>
    magic can be used much like <i>tie()</i> to call a C function any time a
    scalar's value is used or changed. The
    <span class="Li">&quot;MAGIC&quot;</span>'s
    <span class="Li">&quot;mg_ptr&quot;</span> field points to a
    <span class="Li">&quot;ufuncs&quot;</span> structure:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    struct ufuncs {
        I32 (*uf_val)(pTHX_ IV, SV*);
        I32 (*uf_set)(pTHX_ IV, SV*);
        IV uf_index;
    };
</pre>
<p class="Pp">When the SV is read from or written to, the
    <span class="Li">&quot;uf_val&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;uf_set&quot;</span> function will be called with
    <span class="Li">&quot;uf_index&quot;</span> as the first arg and a pointer
    to the SV as the second. A simple example of how to add
    <span class="Li">&quot;PERL_MAGIC_uvar&quot;</span> magic is shown below.
    Note that the ufuncs structure is copied by sv_magic, so you can safely
    allocate it on the stack.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    void
    Umagic(sv)
        SV *sv;
    PREINIT:
        struct ufuncs uf;
    CODE:
        uf.uf_val   = &amp;my_get_fn;
        uf.uf_set   = &amp;my_set_fn;
        uf.uf_index = 0;
        sv_magic(sv, 0, PERL_MAGIC_uvar, (char*)&amp;uf, sizeof(uf));
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Attaching <span class="Li">&quot;PERL_MAGIC_uvar&quot;</span> to
    arrays is permissible but has no effect.</p>
<p class="Pp">For hashes there is a specialized hook that gives control over
    hash keys (but not values). This hook calls
    <span class="Li">&quot;PERL_MAGIC_uvar&quot;</span> 'get' magic if the
    &quot;set&quot; function in the <span class="Li">&quot;ufuncs&quot;</span>
    structure is NULL. The hook is activated whenever the hash is accessed with
    a key specified as an <span class="Li">&quot;SV&quot;</span> through the
    functions <span class="Li">&quot;hv_store_ent&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;hv_fetch_ent&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;hv_delete_ent&quot;</span>, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;hv_exists_ent&quot;</span>. Accessing the key as a
    string through the functions without the
    <span class="Li">&quot;..._ent&quot;</span> suffix circumvents the hook. See
    &quot;GUTS&quot; in Hash::Util::FieldHash for a detailed description.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that because multiple extensions may be using
    <span class="Li">&quot;PERL_MAGIC_ext&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;PERL_MAGIC_uvar&quot;</span> magic, it is important
    for extensions to take extra care to avoid conflict. Typically only using
    the magic on objects blessed into the same class as the extension is
    sufficient. For <span class="Li">&quot;PERL_MAGIC_ext&quot;</span> magic, it
    is usually a good idea to define an
    <span class="Li">&quot;MGVTBL&quot;</span>, even if all its fields will be
    <span class="Li">0</span>, so that individual
    <span class="Li">&quot;MAGIC&quot;</span> pointers can be identified as a
    particular kind of magic using their magic virtual table.
    <span class="Li">&quot;mg_findext&quot;</span> provides an easy way to do
    that:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    STATIC MGVTBL my_vtbl = { 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 };
    MAGIC *mg;
    if ((mg = mg_findext(sv, PERL_MAGIC_ext, &amp;my_vtbl))) {
        /* this is really ours, not another module's PERL_MAGIC_ext */
        my_priv_data_t *priv = (my_priv_data_t *)mg-&gt;mg_ptr;
        ...
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Also note that the <span class="Li">&quot;sv_set*()&quot;</span>
    and <span class="Li">&quot;sv_cat*()&quot;</span> functions described
    earlier do <b>not</b> invoke 'set' magic on their targets. This must be done
    by the user either by calling the
    <span class="Li">&quot;SvSETMAGIC()&quot;</span> macro after calling these
    functions, or by using one of the
    <span class="Li">&quot;sv_set*_mg()&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;sv_cat*_mg()&quot;</span> functions. Similarly,
    generic C code must call the
    <span class="Li">&quot;SvGETMAGIC()&quot;</span> macro to invoke any 'get'
    magic if they use an SV obtained from external sources in functions that
    don't handle magic. See perlapi for a description of these functions. For
    example, calls to the <span class="Li">&quot;sv_cat*()&quot;</span>
    functions typically need to be followed by
    <span class="Li">&quot;SvSETMAGIC()&quot;</span>, but they don't need a
    prior <span class="Li">&quot;SvGETMAGIC()&quot;</span> since their
    implementation handles 'get' magic.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Understanding_the_Magic_of_Tied_Hashes_and_Arrays"><a class="permalink" href="#Understanding_the_Magic_of_Tied_Hashes_and_Arrays">Understanding
  the Magic of Tied Hashes and Arrays</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Tied hashes and arrays are magical beasts of the
    <span class="Li">&quot;PERL_MAGIC_tied&quot;</span> magic type.</p>
<p class="Pp">WARNING: As of the 5.004 release, proper usage of the array and
    hash access functions requires understanding a few caveats. Some of these
    caveats are actually considered bugs in the API, to be fixed in later
    releases, and are bracketed with [MAYCHANGE] below. If you find yourself
    actually applying such information in this section, be aware that the
    behavior may change in the future, umm, without warning.</p>
<p class="Pp">The perl tie function associates a variable with an object that
    implements the various GET, SET, etc methods. To perform the equivalent of
    the perl tie function from an XSUB, you must mimic this behaviour. The code
    below carries out the necessary steps - firstly it creates a new hash, and
    then creates a second hash which it blesses into the class which will
    implement the tie methods. Lastly it ties the two hashes together, and
    returns a reference to the new tied hash. Note that the code below does NOT
    call the TIEHASH method in the MyTie class - see &quot;Calling Perl Routines
    from within C Programs&quot; for details on how to do this.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    SV*
    mytie()
    PREINIT:
        HV *hash;
        HV *stash;
        SV *tie;
    CODE:
        hash = newHV();
        tie = newRV_noinc((SV*)newHV());
        stash = gv_stashpv(&quot;MyTie&quot;, GV_ADD);
        sv_bless(tie, stash);
        hv_magic(hash, (GV*)tie, PERL_MAGIC_tied);
        RETVAL = newRV_noinc(hash);
    OUTPUT:
        RETVAL
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;av_store&quot;</span> function, when
    given a tied array argument, merely copies the magic of the array onto the
    value to be &quot;stored&quot;, using
    <span class="Li">&quot;mg_copy&quot;</span>. It may also return NULL,
    indicating that the value did not actually need to be stored in the array.
    [MAYCHANGE] After a call to <span class="Li">&quot;av_store&quot;</span> on
    a tied array, the caller will usually need to call
    <span class="Li">&quot;mg_set(val)&quot;</span> to actually invoke the perl
    level &quot;STORE&quot; method on the TIEARRAY object. If
    <span class="Li">&quot;av_store&quot;</span> did return NULL, a call to
    <span class="Li">&quot;SvREFCNT_dec(val)&quot;</span> will also be usually
    necessary to avoid a memory leak. [/MAYCHANGE]</p>
<p class="Pp">The previous paragraph is applicable verbatim to tied hash access
    using the <span class="Li">&quot;hv_store&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;hv_store_ent&quot;</span> functions as well.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;av_fetch&quot;</span> and the corresponding
    hash functions <span class="Li">&quot;hv_fetch&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;hv_fetch_ent&quot;</span> actually return an
    undefined mortal value whose magic has been initialized using
    <span class="Li">&quot;mg_copy&quot;</span>. Note the value so returned does
    not need to be deallocated, as it is already mortal. [MAYCHANGE] But you
    will need to call <span class="Li">&quot;mg_get()&quot;</span> on the
    returned value in order to actually invoke the perl level &quot;FETCH&quot;
    method on the underlying TIE object. Similarly, you may also call
    <span class="Li">&quot;mg_set()&quot;</span> on the return value after
    possibly assigning a suitable value to it using
    <span class="Li">&quot;sv_setsv&quot;</span>, which will invoke the
    &quot;STORE&quot; method on the TIE object. [/MAYCHANGE]</p>
<p class="Pp">[MAYCHANGE] In other words, the array or hash fetch/store
    functions don't really fetch and store actual values in the case of tied
    arrays and hashes. They merely call
    <span class="Li">&quot;mg_copy&quot;</span> to attach magic to the values
    that were meant to be &quot;stored&quot; or &quot;fetched&quot;. Later calls
    to <span class="Li">&quot;mg_get&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;mg_set&quot;</span> actually do the job of invoking
    the TIE methods on the underlying objects. Thus the magic mechanism
    currently implements a kind of lazy access to arrays and hashes.</p>
<p class="Pp">Currently (as of perl version 5.004), use of the hash and array
    access functions requires the user to be aware of whether they are operating
    on &quot;normal&quot; hashes and arrays, or on their tied variants. The API
    may be changed to provide more transparent access to both tied and normal
    data types in future versions. [/MAYCHANGE]</p>
<p class="Pp">You would do well to understand that the TIEARRAY and TIEHASH
    interfaces are mere sugar to invoke some perl method calls while using the
    uniform hash and array syntax. The use of this sugar imposes some overhead
    (typically about two to four extra opcodes per FETCH/STORE operation, in
    addition to the creation of all the mortal variables required to invoke the
    methods). This overhead will be comparatively small if the TIE methods are
    themselves substantial, but if they are only a few statements long, the
    overhead will not be insignificant.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Localizing_changes"><a class="permalink" href="#Localizing_changes">Localizing
  changes</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Perl has a very handy construction</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  {
    local $var = 2;
    ...
  }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This construction is <i>approximately</i> equivalent to</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  {
    my $oldvar = $var;
    $var = 2;
    ...
    $var = $oldvar;
  }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The biggest difference is that the first construction would
    reinstate the initial value of <span class="Li">$var</span>, irrespective of
    how control exits the block: <span class="Li">&quot;goto&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;return&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;die&quot;</span>/<span class="Li">&quot;eval&quot;</span>,
    etc. It is a little bit more efficient as well.</p>
<p class="Pp">There is a way to achieve a similar task from C via Perl API:
    create a <i>pseudo-block</i>, and arrange for some changes to be
    automatically undone at the end of it, either explicit, or via a non-local
    exit (via <i>die()</i>). A <i>block</i>-like construct is created by a pair
    of
    <span class="Li">&quot;ENTER&quot;</span>/<span class="Li">&quot;LEAVE&quot;</span>
    macros (see &quot;Returning a Scalar&quot; in perlcall). Such a construct
    may be created specially for some important localized task, or an existing
    one (like boundaries of enclosing Perl subroutine/block, or an existing pair
    for freeing TMPs) may be used. (In the second case the overhead of
    additional localization must be almost negligible.) Note that any XSUB is
    automatically enclosed in an
    <span class="Li">&quot;ENTER&quot;</span>/<span class="Li">&quot;LEAVE&quot;</span>
    pair.</p>
<p class="Pp">Inside such a <i>pseudo-block</i> the following service is
    available:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>&quot;SAVEINT(int i)&quot;</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>&quot;SAVEIV(IV i)&quot;</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>&quot;SAVEI32(I32 i)&quot;</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>&quot;SAVELONG(long i)&quot;</dt>

      survives conversion to <span class="Li">&quot;SV*&quot;</span> and back,
      <span class="Li">&quot;p&quot;</span> should be able to survive conversion
      to <span class="Li">&quot;char*&quot;</span> and back.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;SAVEFREESV(SV *sv)&quot;</dt>
  <dd>The refcount of <span class="Li">&quot;sv&quot;</span> would be
      decremented at the end of <i>pseudo-block</i>. This is similar to
      <span class="Li">&quot;sv_2mortal&quot;</span> in that it is also a
      mechanism for doing a delayed
      <span class="Li">&quot;SvREFCNT_dec&quot;</span>. However, while
      <span class="Li">&quot;sv_2mortal&quot;</span> extends the lifetime of
      <span class="Li">&quot;sv&quot;</span> until the beginning of the next
      statement, <span class="Li">&quot;SAVEFREESV&quot;</span> extends it until
      the end of the enclosing scope. These lifetimes can be wildly different.

<h2 class="Ss" id="XSUBs_and_the_Argument_Stack"><a class="permalink" href="#XSUBs_and_the_Argument_Stack">XSUBs
  and the Argument Stack</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The XSUB mechanism is a simple way for Perl programs to access C
    subroutines. An XSUB routine will have a stack that contains the arguments
    from the Perl program, and a way to map from the Perl data structures to a C
    equivalent.</p>
<p class="Pp">The stack arguments are accessible through the
    <span class="Li">ST(n)</span> macro, which returns the
    <span class="Li">&quot;n&quot;</span>'th stack argument. Argument 0 is the
    first argument passed in the Perl subroutine call. These arguments are
    <span class="Li">&quot;SV*&quot;</span>, and can be used anywhere an
    <span class="Li">&quot;SV*&quot;</span> is used.</p>
<p class="Pp">Most of the time, output from the C routine can be handled through
    use of the RETVAL and OUTPUT directives. However, there are some cases where
    the argument stack is not already long enough to handle all the return
    values. An example is the POSIX <i>tzname()</i> call, which takes no
    arguments, but returns two, the local time zone's standard and summer time
    abbreviations.</p>
<p class="Pp">To handle this situation, the PPCODE directive is used and the
    stack is extended using the macro:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    EXTEND(SP, num);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">where <span class="Li">&quot;SP&quot;</span> is the macro that
    represents the local copy of the stack pointer, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;num&quot;</span> is the number of elements the stack
    should be extended by.</p>
<p class="Pp">Now that there is room on the stack, values can be pushed on it
    using <span class="Li">&quot;PUSHs&quot;</span> macro. The pushed values
    will often need to be &quot;mortal&quot; (See &quot;Reference Counts and
    Mortality&quot;):</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    PUSHs(sv_2mortal(newSViv(an_integer)))
    PUSHs(sv_2mortal(newSVuv(an_unsigned_integer)))
    PUSHs(sv_2mortal(newSVnv(a_double)))
    PUSHs(sv_2mortal(newSVpv(&quot;Some String&quot;,0)))

<p class="Pp">If an AUTOLOAD routine is an XSUB, as with Perl subroutines, Perl
    puts the fully-qualified name of the autoloaded subroutine in the

<p class="Pp"><b>Note</b>: Setting <span class="Li">$AUTOLOAD</span> stopped

    <span class="Li">&quot;SV*&quot;</span> argument contains either the name of
    the Perl subroutine to be called, or a reference to the subroutine. The
    second argument consists of flags that control the context in which the
    subroutine is called, whether or not the subroutine is being passed
    arguments, how errors should be trapped, and how to treat return values.</p>
<p class="Pp">All four routines return the number of arguments that the

<h2 class="Ss" id="Memory_Allocation"><a class="permalink" href="#Memory_Allocation">Memory
  Allocation</a></h2>
<p class="Pp"><i>Allocation</i></p>
<p class="Pp">All memory meant to be used with the Perl API functions should be
    manipulated using the macros described in this section. The macros provide
    the necessary transparency between differences in the actual malloc
    implementation that is used within perl.</p>
<p class="Pp">It is suggested that you enable the version of malloc that is
    distributed with Perl. It keeps pools of various sizes of unallocated memory
    in order to satisfy allocation requests more quickly. However, on some
    platforms, it may cause spurious malloc or free errors.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following three macros are used to initially allocate memory
  :</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    Newx(pointer, number, type);
    Newxc(pointer, number, type, cast);
    Newxz(pointer, number, type);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The first argument <span class="Li">&quot;pointer&quot;</span>
    should be the name of a variable that will point to the newly allocated
    memory.</p>
<p class="Pp">The second and third arguments
    <span class="Li">&quot;number&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;type&quot;</span> specify how many of the specified
    type of data structure should be allocated. The argument
    <span class="Li">&quot;type&quot;</span> is passed to
    <span class="Li">&quot;sizeof&quot;</span>. The final argument to
    <span class="Li">&quot;Newxc&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;cast&quot;</span>, should be used if the
    <span class="Li">&quot;pointer&quot;</span> argument is different from the
    <span class="Li">&quot;type&quot;</span> argument.</p>
<p class="Pp">Unlike the <span class="Li">&quot;Newx&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;Newxc&quot;</span> macros, the
    <span class="Li">&quot;Newxz&quot;</span> macro calls
    <span class="Li">&quot;memzero&quot;</span> to zero out all the newly
    allocated memory.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Reallocation</i></p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    Renew(pointer, number, type);
    Renewc(pointer, number, type, cast);
    Safefree(pointer)
</pre>
<p class="Pp">These three macros are used to change a memory buffer size or to
    free a piece of memory no longer needed. The arguments to
    <span class="Li">&quot;Renew&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;Renewc&quot;</span> match those of
    <span class="Li">&quot;New&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;Newc&quot;</span> with the exception of not needing
    the &quot;magic cookie&quot; argument.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Moving</i></p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    Move(source, dest, number, type);
    Copy(source, dest, number, type);
    Zero(dest, number, type);

<p class="Pp">These three macros are used to move, copy, or zero out previously
    allocated memory. The <span class="Li">&quot;source&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;dest&quot;</span> arguments point to the source and
    destination starting points. Perl will move, copy, or zero out
    <span class="Li">&quot;number&quot;</span> instances of the size of the

<h2 class="Ss" id="Putting_a_C_value_on_Perl_stack"><a class="permalink" href="#Putting_a_C_value_on_Perl_stack">Putting
  a C value on Perl stack</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">A lot of opcodes (this is an elementary operation in the internal
    perl stack machine) put an SV* on the stack. However, as an optimization the
    corresponding SV is (usually) not recreated each time. The opcodes reuse
    specially assigned SVs (<i>target</i>s) which are (as a corollary) not
    constantly freed/created.</p>
<p class="Pp">Each of the targets is created only once (but see
    &quot;Scratchpads and recursion&quot; below), and when an opcode needs to
    put an integer, a double, or a string on stack, it just sets the
    corresponding parts of its <i>target</i> and puts the <i>target</i> on
    stack.</p>
<p class="Pp">The macro to put this target on stack is
    <span class="Li">&quot;PUSHTARG&quot;</span>, and it is directly used in
    some opcodes, as well as indirectly in zillions of others, which use it via
    <span class="Li">&quot;(X)PUSH[iunp]&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Because the target is reused, you must be careful when pushing
    multiple values on the stack. The following code will not do what you
  think:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    XPUSHi(10);
    XPUSHi(20);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This translates as &quot;set
    <span class="Li">&quot;TARG&quot;</span> to 10, push a pointer to
    <span class="Li">&quot;TARG&quot;</span> onto the stack; set
    <span class="Li">&quot;TARG&quot;</span> to 20, push a pointer to
    <span class="Li">&quot;TARG&quot;</span> onto the stack&quot;. At the end of
    the operation, the stack does not contain the values 10 and 20, but actually
    contains two pointers to <span class="Li">&quot;TARG&quot;</span>, which we
    have set to 20.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you need to push multiple different values then you should
    either use the <span class="Li">&quot;(X)PUSHs&quot;</span> macros, or else
    use the new <span class="Li">&quot;m(X)PUSH[iunp]&quot;</span> macros, none
    of which make use of <span class="Li">&quot;TARG&quot;</span>. The
    <span class="Li">&quot;(X)PUSHs&quot;</span> macros simply push an SV* on
    the stack, which, as noted under &quot;XSUBs and the Argument Stack&quot;,
    will often need to be &quot;mortal&quot;. The new
    <span class="Li">&quot;m(X)PUSH[iunp]&quot;</span> macros make this a little
    easier to achieve by creating a new mortal for you (via
    <span class="Li">&quot;(X)PUSHmortal&quot;</span>), pushing that onto the
    stack (extending it if necessary in the case of the
    <span class="Li">&quot;mXPUSH[iunp]&quot;</span> macros), and then setting
    its value. Thus, instead of writing this to &quot;fix&quot; the example
    above:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    XPUSHs(sv_2mortal(newSViv(10)))
    XPUSHs(sv_2mortal(newSViv(20)))
</pre>
<p class="Pp">you can simply write:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    mXPUSHi(10)
    mXPUSHi(20)
</pre>
<p class="Pp">On a related note, if you do use
    <span class="Li">&quot;(X)PUSH[iunp]&quot;</span>, then you're going to need
    a <span class="Li">&quot;dTARG&quot;</span> in your variable declarations so
    that the <span class="Li">&quot;*PUSH*&quot;</span> macros can make use of
    the local variable <span class="Li">&quot;TARG&quot;</span>. See also
    <span class="Li">&quot;dTARGET&quot;</span> and

<h2 class="Ss" id="Scratchpads"><a class="permalink" href="#Scratchpads">Scratchpads</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The question remains on when the SVs which are <i>target</i>s for
    opcodes are created. The answer is that they are created when the current
    unit--a subroutine or a file (for opcodes for statements outside of
    subroutines)--is compiled. During this time a special anonymous Perl array
    is created, which is called a scratchpad for the current unit.</p>
<p class="Pp">A scratchpad keeps SVs which are lexicals for the current unit and
    are targets for opcodes. One can deduce that an SV lives on a scratchpad by
    looking on its flags: lexicals have
    <span class="Li">&quot;SVs_PADMY&quot;</span> set, and <i>target</i>s have
    <span class="Li">&quot;SVs_PADTMP&quot;</span> set.</p>
<p class="Pp">The correspondence between OPs and <i>target</i>s is not 1-to-1.
    Different OPs in the compile tree of the unit can use the same target, if
    this would not conflict with the expected life of the temporary.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Scratchpads_and_recursion"><a class="permalink" href="#Scratchpads_and_recursion">Scratchpads
  and recursion</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">In fact it is not 100% true that a compiled unit contains a
    pointer to the scratchpad AV. In fact it contains a pointer to an AV of
    (initially) one element, and this element is the scratchpad AV. Why do we
    need an extra level of indirection?</p>
<p class="Pp">The answer is <b>recursion</b>, and maybe <b>threads</b>. Both
    these can create several execution pointers going into the same subroutine.
    For the subroutine-child not write over the temporaries for the
    subroutine-parent (lifespan of which covers the call to the child), the
    parent and the child should have different scratchpads. (<i>And</i> the
    lexicals should be separate anyway!)</p>
<p class="Pp">So each subroutine is born with an array of scratchpads (of length
    1). On each entry to the subroutine it is checked that the current depth of
    the recursion is not more than the length of this array, and if it is, new
    scratchpad is created and pushed into the array.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>target</i>s on this scratchpad are
    <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span>s, but they are already marked with
    correct flags.</p>

<p class="Pp">(but slightly more complicated). This tree reflects the way Perl
    parsed your code, but has nothing to do with the execution order. There is
    an additional &quot;thread&quot; going through the nodes of the tree which
    shows the order of execution of the nodes. In our simplified example above

    <span class="Li">&quot;3</span> <span class="Li">4 5 6&quot;</span> (node
    <span class="Li">6</span> is not included into above listing), i.e.,
    <span class="Li">&quot;gvsv gvsv add whatever&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Each of these nodes represents an op, a fundamental operation
    inside the Perl core. The code which implements each operation can be found
    in the <i>pp*.c</i> files; the function which implements the op with type
    <span class="Li">&quot;gvsv&quot;</span> is
    <span class="Li">&quot;pp_gvsv&quot;</span>, and so on. As the tree above
    shows, different ops have different numbers of children:
    <span class="Li">&quot;add&quot;</span> is a binary operator, as one would
    expect, and so has two children. To accommodate the various different
    numbers of children, there are various types of op data structure, and they
    link together in different ways.</p>
<p class="Pp">The simplest type of op structure is
    <span class="Li">&quot;OP&quot;</span>: this has no children. Unary
    operators, <span class="Li">&quot;UNOP&quot;</span>s, have one child, and
    this is pointed to by the <span class="Li">&quot;op_first&quot;</span>
    field. Binary operators (<span class="Li">&quot;BINOP&quot;</span>s) have
    not only an <span class="Li">&quot;op_first&quot;</span> field but also an
    <span class="Li">&quot;op_last&quot;</span> field. The most complex type of
    op is a <span class="Li">&quot;LISTOP&quot;</span>, which has any number of
    children. In this case, the first child is pointed to by
    <span class="Li">&quot;op_first&quot;</span> and the last child by
    <span class="Li">&quot;op_last&quot;</span>. The children in between can be
    found by iteratively following the
    <span class="Li">&quot;op_sibling&quot;</span> pointer from the first child
    to the last.</p>
<p class="Pp">There are also two other op types: a
    <span class="Li">&quot;PMOP&quot;</span> holds a regular expression, and has
    no children, and a <span class="Li">&quot;LOOP&quot;</span> may or may not
    have children. If the <span class="Li">&quot;op_children&quot;</span> field
    is non-zero, it behaves like a <span class="Li">&quot;LISTOP&quot;</span>.
    To complicate matters, if a <span class="Li">&quot;UNOP&quot;</span> is
    actually a <span class="Li">&quot;null&quot;</span> op after optimization
    (see &quot;Compile pass 2: context propagation&quot;) it will still have
    children in accordance with its former type.</p>
<p class="Pp">Another way to examine the tree is to use a compiler back-end
    module, such as B::Concise.</p>

<p class="Pp">What makes this pass interesting for perl developers is that some
    optimization may be performed on this pass. This is optimization by
    so-called &quot;check routines&quot;. The correspondence between node names

<p class="Pp">A check routine is called when the node is fully constructed

    above/below it.</p>
<p class="Pp">The check routine returns the node which should be inserted into

  pass 2: context propagation</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">When a context for a part of compile tree is known, it is
    propagated down through the tree. At this time the context can have 5 values
    (instead of 2 for runtime context): void, boolean, scalar, list, and lvalue.
    In contrast with the pass 1 this pass is processed from top to bottom: a
    node's context determines the context for its children.</p>
<p class="Pp">Additional context-dependent optimizations are performed at this
    time. Since at this moment the compile tree contains back-references (via
    &quot;thread&quot; pointers), nodes cannot be <i>free()</i>d now. To allow
    optimized-away nodes at this stage, such nodes are <i>null()</i>ified
    instead of <i>free()</i>ing (i.e. their type is changed to OP_NULL).</p>

  pass 3: peephole optimization</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">After the compile tree for a subroutine (or for an
    <span class="Li">&quot;eval&quot;</span> or a file) is created, an
    additional pass over the code is performed. This pass is neither top-down or
    bottom-up, but in the execution order (with additional complications for
    conditionals). Optimizations performed at this stage are subject to the same
    restrictions as in the pass 2.</p>
<p class="Pp">Peephole optimizations are done by calling the function pointed to
    by the global variable <span class="Li">&quot;PL_peepp&quot;</span>. By
    default, <span class="Li">&quot;PL_peepp&quot;</span> just calls the
    function pointed to by the global variable
    <span class="Li">&quot;PL_rpeepp&quot;</span>. By default, that performs
    some basic op fixups and optimisations along the execution-order op chain,
    and recursively calls <span class="Li">&quot;PL_rpeepp&quot;</span> for each
    side chain of ops (resulting from conditionals). Extensions may provide
    additional optimisations or fixups, hooking into either the per-subroutine
    or recursive stage, like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    static peep_t prev_peepp;
    static void my_peep(pTHX_ OP *o)

<h2 class="Ss" id="Compile-time_scope_hooks"><a class="permalink" href="#Compile-time_scope_hooks">Compile-time
  scope hooks</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">As of perl 5.14 it is possible to hook into the compile-time
    lexical scope mechanism using
    <span class="Li">&quot;Perl_blockhook_register&quot;</span>. This is used
    like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    STATIC void my_start_hook(pTHX_ int full);
    STATIC BHK my_hooks;
    BOOT:
        BhkENTRY_set(&amp;my_hooks, bhk_start, my_start_hook);
        Perl_blockhook_register(aTHX_ &amp;my_hooks);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This will arrange to have
    <span class="Li">&quot;my_start_hook&quot;</span> called at the start of
    compiling every lexical scope. The available hooks are:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>&quot;void bhk_start(pTHX_ int full)&quot;</dt>
  <dd>This is called just after starting a new lexical scope. Note that Perl
      code like
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    if ($x) { ... }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">creates two scopes: the first starts at the
        <span class="Li">&quot;(&quot;</span> and has
        <span class="Li">&quot;full == 1&quot;</span>, the second starts at the
        <span class="Li">&quot;{&quot;</span> and has
        <span class="Li">&quot;full == 0&quot;</span>. Both end at the
        <span class="Li">&quot;}&quot;</span>, so calls to
        <span class="Li">&quot;start&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;pre/post_end&quot;</span> will match. Anything
        pushed onto the save stack by this hook will be popped just before the
        scope ends (between the <span class="Li">&quot;pre_&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;post_end&quot;</span> hooks, in fact).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>&quot;void bhk_pre_end(pTHX_ OP **o)&quot;</dt>
  <dd>This is called at the end of a lexical scope, just before unwinding the
      stack. <i>o</i> is the root of the optree representing the scope; it is a
      double pointer so you can replace the OP if you need to.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;void bhk_post_end(pTHX_ OP **o)&quot;</dt>
  <dd>This is called at the end of a lexical scope, just after unwinding the
      stack. <i>o</i> is as above. Note that it is possible for calls to
      <span class="Li">&quot;pre_&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;post_end&quot;</span> to nest, if there is
      something on the save stack that calls string eval.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;void bhk_eval(pTHX_ OP *const o)&quot;</dt>
  <dd>This is called just before starting to compile an
      <span class="Li">&quot;eval STRING&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;do</span> <span class="Li">FILE&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;require&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;use&quot;</span>, after the eval has been set up.
      <i>o</i> is the OP that requested the eval, and will normally be an
      <span class="Li">&quot;OP_ENTEREVAL&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;OP_DOFILE&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;OP_REQUIRE&quot;</span>.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Once you have your hook functions, you need a
    <span class="Li">&quot;BHK&quot;</span> structure to put them in. It's best
    to allocate it statically, since there is no way to free it once it's
    registered. The function pointers should be inserted into this structure
    using the <span class="Li">&quot;BhkENTRY_set&quot;</span> macro, which will
    also set flags indicating which entries are valid. If you do need to
    allocate your <span class="Li">&quot;BHK&quot;</span> dynamically for some
    reason, be sure to zero it before you start.</p>
<p class="Pp">Once registered, there is no mechanism to switch these hooks off,
    so if that is necessary you will need to do this yourself. An entry in
    <span class="Li">&quot;%^H&quot;</span> is probably the best way, so the
    effect is lexically scoped; however it is also possible to use the
    <span class="Li">&quot;BhkDISABLE&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;BhkENABLE&quot;</span> macros to temporarily switch
    entries on and off. You should also be aware that generally speaking at
    least one scope will have opened before your extension is loaded, so you
    will see some <span class="Li">&quot;pre/post_end&quot;</span> pairs that
    didn't have a matching <span class="Li">&quot;start&quot;</span>.</p>

  multiple interpreters and concurrency are supported</a></h1>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Background_and_"><a class="permalink" href="#Background_and_">Background
  and PERL_IMPLICIT_CONTEXT</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The Perl interpreter can be regarded as a closed box: it has an
    API for feeding it code or otherwise making it do things, but it also has
    functions for its own use. This smells a lot like an object, and there are
    ways for you to build Perl so that you can have multiple interpreters, with
    one interpreter represented either as a C structure, or inside a
    thread-specific structure. These structures contain all the context, the
    state of that interpreter.</p>
<p class="Pp">One macro controls the major Perl build flavor: MULTIPLICITY. The
    MULTIPLICITY build has a C structure that packages all the interpreter
    state. With multiplicity-enabled perls, PERL_IMPLICIT_CONTEXT is also
    normally defined, and enables the support for passing in a
    &quot;hidden&quot; first argument that represents all three data structures.
    MULTIPLICITY makes multi-threaded perls possible (with the ithreads
    threading model, related to the macro USE_ITHREADS.)</p>
<p class="Pp">Two other &quot;encapsulation&quot; macros are the
    PERL_GLOBAL_STRUCT and PERL_GLOBAL_STRUCT_PRIVATE (the latter turns on the
    former, and the former turns on MULTIPLICITY.) The PERL_GLOBAL_STRUCT causes
    all the internal variables of Perl to be wrapped inside a single global
    struct, struct perl_vars, accessible as (globals) &amp;PL_Vars or PL_VarsPtr
    or the function <i>Perl_GetVars()</i>. The PERL_GLOBAL_STRUCT_PRIVATE goes
    one step further, there is still a single struct (allocated in <i>main()</i>
    either from heap or from stack) but there are no global data symbols
    pointing to it. In either case the global struct should be initialised as
    the very first thing in <i>main()</i> using <i>Perl_init_global_struct()</i>
    and correspondingly tear it down after <i>perl_free()</i> using
    <i>Perl_free_global_struct()</i>, please see <i>miniperlmain.c</i> for usage
    details. You may also need to use <span class="Li">&quot;dVAR&quot;</span>
    in your coding to &quot;declare the global variables&quot; when you are
    using them. dTHX does this for you automatically.</p>
<p class="Pp">To see whether you have non-const data you can use a
    BSD-compatible <span class="Li">&quot;nm&quot;</span>:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  nm libperl.a | grep -v ' [TURtr] '
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If this displays any <span class="Li">&quot;D&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;d&quot;</span> symbols, you have non-const data.</p>
<p class="Pp">For backward compatibility reasons defining just
    PERL_GLOBAL_STRUCT doesn't actually hide all symbols inside a big global
    struct: some PerlIO_xxx vtables are left visible. The
    PERL_GLOBAL_STRUCT_PRIVATE then hides everything (see how the
    PERLIO_FUNCS_DECL is used).</p>
<p class="Pp">All this obviously requires a way for the Perl internal functions
    to be either subroutines taking some kind of structure as the first
    argument, or subroutines taking nothing as the first argument. To enable
    these two very different ways of building the interpreter, the Perl source
    (as it does in so many other situations) makes heavy use of macros and
    subroutine naming conventions.</p>
<p class="Pp">First problem: deciding which functions will be public API
    functions and which will be private. All functions whose names begin
    <span class="Li">&quot;S_&quot;</span> are private (think &quot;S&quot; for
    &quot;secret&quot; or &quot;static&quot;). All other functions begin with
    &quot;Perl_&quot;, but just because a function begins with &quot;Perl_&quot;
    does not mean it is part of the API. (See &quot;Internal Functions&quot;.)
    The easiest way to be <b>sure</b> a function is part of the API is to find
    its entry in perlapi. If it exists in perlapi, it's part of the API. If it
    doesn't, and you think it should be (i.e., you need it for your extension),
    send mail via perlbug explaining why you think it should be.</p>
<p class="Pp">Second problem: there must be a syntax so that the same subroutine
    declarations and calls can pass a structure as their first argument, or pass
    nothing. To solve this, the subroutines are named and declared in a
    particular way. Here's a typical start of a static function used within the
    Perl guts:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  STATIC void
  S_incline(pTHX_ char *s)
</pre>
<p class="Pp">STATIC becomes &quot;static&quot; in C, and may be #define'd to
    nothing in some configurations in the future.</p>
<p class="Pp">A public function (i.e. part of the internal API, but not
    necessarily sanctioned for use in extensions) begins like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  void
  Perl_sv_setiv(pTHX_ SV* dsv, IV num)
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;pTHX_&quot;</span> is one of a number of
    macros (in <i>perl.h</i>) that hide the details of the interpreter's
    context. THX stands for &quot;thread&quot;, &quot;this&quot;, or
    &quot;thingy&quot;, as the case may be. (And no, George Lucas is not
    involved. :-) The first character could be 'p' for a <b>p</b>rototype, 'a'
    for <b>a</b>rgument, or 'd' for <b>d</b>eclaration, so we have
    <span class="Li">&quot;pTHX&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;aTHX&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;dTHX&quot;</span>, and their variants.</p>
<p class="Pp">When Perl is built without options that set PERL_IMPLICIT_CONTEXT,
    there is no first argument containing the interpreter's context. The
    trailing underscore in the pTHX_ macro indicates that the macro expansion
    needs a comma after the context argument because other arguments follow it.
    If PERL_IMPLICIT_CONTEXT is not defined, pTHX_ will be ignored, and the
    subroutine is not prototyped to take the extra argument. The form of the
    macro without the trailing underscore is used when there are no additional
    explicit arguments.</p>
<p class="Pp">When a core function calls another, it must pass the context. This
    is normally hidden via macros. Consider
    <span class="Li">&quot;sv_setiv&quot;</span>. It expands into something like
    this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    #ifdef PERL_IMPLICIT_CONTEXT
      #define sv_setiv(a,b)      Perl_sv_setiv(aTHX_ a, b)
      /* can't do this for vararg functions, see below */
    #else
      #define sv_setiv           Perl_sv_setiv
    #endif
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This works well, and means that XS authors can gleefully
  write:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    sv_setiv(foo, bar);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">and still have it work under all the modes Perl could have been
    compiled with.</p>
<p class="Pp">This doesn't work so cleanly for varargs functions, though, as
    macros imply that the number of arguments is known in advance. Instead we
    either need to spell them out fully, passing
    <span class="Li">&quot;aTHX_&quot;</span> as the first argument (the Perl
    core tends to do this with functions like Perl_warner), or use a
    context-free version.</p>
<p class="Pp">The context-free version of Perl_warner is called
    Perl_warner_nocontext, and does not take the extra argument. Instead it does
    dTHX; to get the context from thread-local storage. We
    <span class="Li">&quot;#define warner Perl_warner_nocontext&quot;</span> so
    that extensions get source compatibility at the expense of performance.
    (Passing an arg is cheaper than grabbing it from thread-local storage.)</p>
<p class="Pp">You can ignore [pad]THXx when browsing the Perl headers/sources.
    Those are strictly for use within the core. Extensions and embedders need
    only be aware of [pad]THX.</p>

    <span class="Li">&quot;THX&quot;</span> mechanism to pass context pointers
    around, so <span class="Li">&quot;dTHR&quot;</span> is not useful any more.
    Perl 5.6.0 and later still have it for backward source compatibility, but it

  do I use all this in extensions?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">When Perl is built with PERL_IMPLICIT_CONTEXT, extensions that
    call any functions in the Perl API will need to pass the initial context
    argument somehow. The kicker is that you will need to write it in such a way
    that the extension still compiles when Perl hasn't been built with
    PERL_IMPLICIT_CONTEXT enabled.</p>
<p class="Pp">There are three ways to do this. First, the easy but inefficient
    way, which is also the default, in order to maintain source compatibility
    with extensions: whenever <i>XSUB.h</i> is #included, it redefines the aTHX
    and aTHX_ macros to call a function that will return the context. Thus,
    something like:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        sv_setiv(sv, num);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">in your extension will translate to this when
    PERL_IMPLICIT_CONTEXT is in effect:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        Perl_sv_setiv(Perl_get_context(), sv, num);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">or to this otherwise:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        Perl_sv_setiv(sv, num);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">You don't have to do anything new in your extension to get this;
    since the Perl library provides <i>Perl_get_context()</i>, it will all just
    work.</p>
<p class="Pp">The second, more efficient way is to use the following template
    for your Foo.xs:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        #define PERL_NO_GET_CONTEXT     /* we want efficiency */
        #include &quot;EXTERN.h&quot;
        #include &quot;perl.h&quot;
        #include &quot;XSUB.h&quot;
        STATIC void my_private_function(int arg1, int arg2);
        STATIC void
        my_private_function(int arg1, int arg2)
        {
            dTHX;       /* fetch context */
            ... call many Perl API functions ...
        }
        [... etc ...]
        MODULE = Foo            PACKAGE = Foo
        /* typical XSUB */
        void
        my_xsub(arg)
                int arg
            CODE:
                my_private_function(arg, 10);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Note that the only two changes from the normal way of writing an
    extension is the addition of a <span class="Li">&quot;#define
    PERL_NO_GET_CONTEXT&quot;</span> before including the Perl headers, followed
    by a <span class="Li">&quot;dTHX;&quot;</span> declaration at the start of
    every function that will call the Perl API. (You'll know which functions
    need this, because the C compiler will complain that there's an undeclared
    identifier in those functions.) No changes are needed for the XSUBs
    themselves, because the <i>XS()</i> macro is correctly defined to pass in
    the implicit context if needed.</p>
<p class="Pp">The third, even more efficient way is to ape how it is done within
    the Perl guts:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        #define PERL_NO_GET_CONTEXT     /* we want efficiency */
        #include &quot;EXTERN.h&quot;
        #include &quot;perl.h&quot;
        #include &quot;XSUB.h&quot;
        /* pTHX_ only needed for functions that call Perl API */
        STATIC void my_private_function(pTHX_ int arg1, int arg2);
        STATIC void
        my_private_function(pTHX_ int arg1, int arg2)
        {
            /* dTHX; not needed here, because THX is an argument */
            ... call Perl API functions ...
        }
        [... etc ...]
        MODULE = Foo            PACKAGE = Foo
        /* typical XSUB */
        void
        my_xsub(arg)
                int arg
            CODE:
                my_private_function(aTHX_ arg, 10);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This implementation never has to fetch the context using a
    function call, since it is always passed as an extra argument. Depending on
    your needs for simplicity or efficiency, you may mix the previous two
    approaches freely.</p>

  I do anything special if I call perl from multiple threads?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">If you create interpreters in one thread and then proceed to call
    them in another, you need to make sure perl's own Thread Local Storage (TLS)
    slot is initialized correctly in each of those threads.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;perl_alloc&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;perl_clone&quot;</span> API functions will
    automatically set the TLS slot to the interpreter they created, so that
    there is no need to do anything special if the interpreter is always
    accessed in the same thread that created it, and that thread did not create
    or call any other interpreters afterwards. If that is not the case, you have
    to set the TLS slot of the thread before calling any functions in the Perl
    API on that particular interpreter. This is done by calling the
    <span class="Li">&quot;PERL_SET_CONTEXT&quot;</span> macro in that thread as
    the first thing you do:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>

  Plans and PERL_IMPLICIT_SYS</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Just as PERL_IMPLICIT_CONTEXT provides a way to bundle up
    everything that the interpreter knows about itself and pass it around, so
    too are there plans to allow the interpreter to bundle up everything it
    knows about the environment it's running on. This is enabled with the
    PERL_IMPLICIT_SYS macro. Currently it only works with USE_ITHREADS on
    Windows.</p>
<p class="Pp">This allows the ability to provide an extra pointer (called the
    &quot;host&quot; environment) for all the system calls. This makes it
    possible for all the system stuff to maintain their own state, broken down
    into seven C structures. These are thin wrappers around the usual system
    calls (see <i>win32/perllib.c</i>) for the default perl executable, but for
    a more ambitious host (like the one that would do <i>fork()</i> emulation)
    all the extra work needed to pretend that different interpreters are
    actually different &quot;processes&quot;, would be done here.</p>
<p class="Pp">The Perl engine/interpreter and the host are orthogonal entities.
    There could be one or more interpreters in a process, and one or more
    &quot;hosts&quot;, with free association between them.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="Internal_Functions"><a class="permalink" href="#Internal_Functions">Internal
  Functions</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">All of Perl's internal functions which will be exposed to the
    outside world are prefixed by <span class="Li">&quot;Perl_&quot;</span> so
    that they will not conflict with XS functions or functions used in a program
    in which Perl is embedded. Similarly, all global variables begin with
    <span class="Li">&quot;PL_&quot;</span>. (By convention, static functions
    start with <span class="Li">&quot;S_&quot;</span>.)</p>
<p class="Pp">Inside the Perl core
    (<span class="Li">&quot;PERL_CORE&quot;</span> defined), you can get at the
    functions either with or without the
    <span class="Li">&quot;Perl_&quot;</span> prefix, thanks to a bunch of
    defines that live in <i>embed.h</i>. Note that extension code should
    <i>not</i> set <span class="Li">&quot;PERL_CORE&quot;</span>; this exposes
    the full perl internals, and is likely to cause breakage of the XS in each
    new perl release.</p>
<p class="Pp">The file <i>embed.h</i> is generated automatically from
    <i>embed.pl</i> and <i>embed.fnc</i>. <i>embed.pl</i> also creates the
    prototyping header files for the internal functions, generates the
    documentation and a lot of other bits and pieces. It's important that when
    you add a new function to the core or change an existing one, you change the
    data in the table in <i>embed.fnc</i> as well. Here's a sample entry from
    that table:</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Exception_Handling"><a class="permalink" href="#Exception_Handling">Exception
  Handling</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">There are a couple of macros to do very basic exception handling
    in XS modules. You have to define
    <span class="Li">&quot;NO_XSLOCKS&quot;</span> before including
    <i>XSUB.h</i> to be able to use these macros:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        #define NO_XSLOCKS
        #include &quot;XSUB.h&quot;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">You can use these macros if you call code that may croak, but you
    need to do some cleanup before giving control back to Perl. For example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        dXCPT;    /* set up necessary variables */
        XCPT_TRY_START {
          code_that_may_croak();
        } XCPT_TRY_END
        XCPT_CATCH
        {
          /* do cleanup here */
          XCPT_RETHROW;
        }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Note that you always have to rethrow an exception that has been
    caught. Using these macros, it is not possible to just catch the exception
    and ignore it. If you have to ignore the exception, you have to use the
    <span class="Li">&quot;call_*&quot;</span> function.</p>
<p class="Pp">The advantage of using the above macros is that you don't have to
    setup an extra function for <span class="Li">&quot;call_*&quot;</span>, and

    code it themselves when supporting multiple versions of Perl.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;Devel::PPPort&quot;</span> generates a C

<h1 class="Sh" id="Unicode_Support"><a class="permalink" href="#Unicode_Support">Unicode
  Support</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Perl 5.6.0 introduced Unicode support. It's important for porters
    and XS writers to understand this support and make sure that the code they
    write does not corrupt Unicode data.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="What_"><a class="permalink" href="#What_">What <b>is</b>
  Unicode, anyway?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">In the olden, less enlightened times, we all used to use ASCII.
    Most of us did, anyway. The big problem with ASCII is that it's American.
    Well, no, that's not actually the problem; the problem is that it's not
    particularly useful for people who don't use the Roman alphabet. What used
    to happen was that particular languages would stick their own alphabet in
    the upper range of the sequence, between 128 and 255. Of course, we then
    ended up with plenty of variants that weren't quite ASCII, and the whole
    point of it being a standard was lost.</p>
<p class="Pp">Worse still, if you've got a language like Chinese or Japanese
    that has hundreds or thousands of characters, then you really can't fit them
    into a mere 256, so they had to forget about ASCII altogether, and build
    their own systems using pairs of numbers to refer to one character.</p>
<p class="Pp">To fix this, some people formed Unicode, Inc. and produced a new
    character set containing all the characters you can possibly think of and
    more. There are several ways of representing these characters, and the one
    Perl uses is called UTF-8. UTF-8 uses a variable number of bytes to
    represent a character. You can learn more about Unicode and Perl's Unicode
    model in perlunicode.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="How_can_I_recognise_a_"><a class="permalink" href="#How_can_I_recognise_a_">How
  can I recognise a UTF-8 string?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">You can't. This is because UTF-8 data is stored in bytes just like
    non-UTF-8 data. The Unicode character 200, (<span class="Li">0xC8</span> for
    you hex types) capital E with a grave accent, is represented by the two
    bytes <span class="Li">&quot;v196.172&quot;</span>. Unfortunately, the
    non-Unicode string <span class="Li">&quot;chr(196).chr(172)&quot;</span> has
    that byte sequence as well. So you can't tell just by looking - this is what
    makes Unicode input an interesting problem.</p>
<p class="Pp">In general, you either have to know what you're dealing with, or
    you have to guess. The API function
    <span class="Li">&quot;is_utf8_string&quot;</span> can help; it'll tell you
    if a string contains only valid UTF-8 characters. However, it can't do the
    work for you. On a character-by-character basis,
    <span class="Li">&quot;is_utf8_char_buf&quot;</span> will tell you whether
    the current character in a string is valid UTF-8. </p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="How_does_"><a class="permalink" href="#How_does_">How does
  UTF-8 represent Unicode characters?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">As mentioned above, UTF-8 uses a variable number of bytes to store
    a character. Characters with values 0...127 are stored in one byte, just
    like good ol' ASCII. Character 128 is stored as
    <span class="Li">&quot;v194.128&quot;</span>; this continues up to character
    191, which is <span class="Li">&quot;v194.191&quot;</span>. Now we've run
    out of bits (191 is binary <span class="Li">10111111</span>) so we move on;
    192 is <span class="Li">&quot;v195.128&quot;</span>. And so it goes on,
    moving to three bytes at character 2048.</p>
<p class="Pp">Assuming you know you're dealing with a UTF-8 string, you can find
    out how long the first character in it is with the
    <span class="Li">&quot;UTF8SKIP&quot;</span> macro:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    char *utf = &quot;\305\233\340\240\201&quot;;
    I32 len;
    len = UTF8SKIP(utf); /* len is 2 here */
    utf += len;
    len = UTF8SKIP(utf); /* len is 3 here */
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Another way to skip over characters in a UTF-8 string is to use
    <span class="Li">&quot;utf8_hop&quot;</span>, which takes a string and a
    number of characters to skip over. You're on your own about bounds checking,
    though, so don't use it lightly.</p>
<p class="Pp">All bytes in a multi-byte UTF-8 character will have the high bit
    set, so you can test if you need to do something special with this character
    like this (the <i>UTF8_IS_INVARIANT()</i> is a macro that tests whether the
    byte can be encoded as a single byte even in UTF-8):</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    U8 *utf;
    U8 *utf_end; /* 1 beyond buffer pointed to by utf */
    UV uv;      /* Note: a UV, not a U8, not a char */
    STRLEN len; /* length of character in bytes */
    if (!UTF8_IS_INVARIANT(*utf))
        /* Must treat this as UTF-8 */
        uv = utf8_to_uvchr_buf(utf, utf_end, &amp;len);
    else
        /* OK to treat this character as a byte */
        uv = *utf;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">You can also see in that example that we use
    <span class="Li">&quot;utf8_to_uvchr_buf&quot;</span> to get the value of
    the character; the inverse function
    <span class="Li">&quot;uvchr_to_utf8&quot;</span> is available for putting a
    UV into UTF-8:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    if (!UTF8_IS_INVARIANT(uv))
        /* Must treat this as UTF8 */
        utf8 = uvchr_to_utf8(utf8, uv);
    else
        /* OK to treat this character as a byte */
        *utf8++ = uv;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">You <b>must</b> convert characters to UVs using the above
    functions if you're ever in a situation where you have to match UTF-8 and
    non-UTF-8 characters. You may not skip over UTF-8 characters in this case.
    If you do this, you'll lose the ability to match hi-bit non-UTF-8
    characters; for instance, if your UTF-8 string contains
    <span class="Li">&quot;v196.172&quot;</span>, and you skip that character,
    you can never match a <span class="Li">&quot;chr(200)&quot;</span> in a
    non-UTF-8 string. So don't do that!</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="How_does_Perl_store_"><a class="permalink" href="#How_does_Perl_store_">How
  does Perl store UTF-8 strings?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Currently, Perl deals with Unicode strings and non-Unicode strings
    slightly differently. A flag in the SV,
    <span class="Li">&quot;SVf_UTF8&quot;</span>, indicates that the string is
    internally encoded as UTF-8. Without it, the byte value is the codepoint
    number and vice versa (in other words, the string is encoded as iso-8859-1,
    but <span class="Li">&quot;use feature 'unicode_strings'&quot;</span> is
    needed to get iso-8859-1 semantics). You can check and manipulate this flag
    with the following macros:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    SvUTF8(sv)
    SvUTF8_on(sv)
    SvUTF8_off(sv)
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This flag has an important effect on Perl's treatment of the
    string: if Unicode data is not properly distinguished, regular expressions,
    <span class="Li">&quot;length&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;substr&quot;</span> and other string handling
    operations will have undesirable results.</p>
<p class="Pp">The problem comes when you have, for instance, a string that isn't
    flagged as UTF-8, and contains a byte sequence that could be UTF-8 -
    especially when combining non-UTF-8 and UTF-8 strings.</p>
<p class="Pp">Never forget that the <span class="Li">&quot;SVf_UTF8&quot;</span>
    flag is separate to the PV value; you need be sure you don't accidentally
    knock it off while you're manipulating SVs. More specifically, you cannot
    expect to do this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    SV *sv;
    SV *nsv;
    STRLEN len;
    char *p;
    p = SvPV(sv, len);
    frobnicate(p);
    nsv = newSVpvn(p, len);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;char*&quot;</span> string does not tell
    you the whole story, and you can't copy or reconstruct an SV just by copying
    the string value. Check if the old SV has the UTF8 flag set, and act
    accordingly:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    p = SvPV(sv, len);
    frobnicate(p);
    nsv = newSVpvn(p, len);

<p class="Pp">In fact, your <span class="Li">&quot;frobnicate&quot;</span>
    function should be made aware of whether or not it's dealing with UTF-8
    data, so that it can handle the string appropriately.</p>
<p class="Pp">Since just passing an SV to an XS function and copying the data of
    the SV is not enough to copy the UTF8 flags, even less right is just passing
    a <span class="Li">&quot;char *&quot;</span> to an XS function.</p>

  do I convert a string to UTF-8?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">If you're mixing UTF-8 and non-UTF-8 strings, it is necessary to
    upgrade one of the strings to UTF-8. If you've got an SV, the easiest way to
    do this is:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    sv_utf8_upgrade(sv);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">However, you must not do this, for example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    if (!SvUTF8(left))
        sv_utf8_upgrade(left);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If you do this in a binary operator, you will actually change one
    of the strings that came into the operator, and, while it shouldn't be
    noticeable by the end user, it can cause problems in deficient code.</p>
<p class="Pp">Instead, <span class="Li">&quot;bytes_to_utf8&quot;</span> will
    give you a UTF-8-encoded <b>copy</b> of its string argument. This is useful
    for having the data available for comparisons and so on, without harming the
    original SV. There's also <span class="Li">&quot;utf8_to_bytes&quot;</span>
    to go the other way, but naturally, this will fail if the string contains
    any characters above 255 that can't be represented in a single byte.</p>

  there anything else I need to know?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Not really. Just remember these things:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>There's no way to tell if a string is UTF-8 or not. You can tell if an SV
      is UTF-8 by looking at its <span class="Li">&quot;SvUTF8&quot;</span>
      flag. Don't forget to set the flag if something should be UTF-8. Treat the
      flag as part of the PV, even though it's not - if you pass on the PV to
      somewhere, pass on the flag too.</li>
  <li>If a string is UTF-8, <b>always</b> use
      <span class="Li">&quot;utf8_to_uvchr_buf&quot;</span> to get at the value,
      unless <span class="Li">&quot;UTF8_IS_INVARIANT(*s)&quot;</span> in which
      case you can use <span class="Li">*s</span>.</li>
  <li>When writing a character <span class="Li">&quot;uv&quot;</span> to a UTF-8
      string, <b>always</b> use
      <span class="Li">&quot;uvchr_to_utf8&quot;</span>, unless
      <span class="Li">&quot;UTF8_IS_INVARIANT(uv))&quot;</span> in which case
      you can use <span class="Li">&quot;*s = uv&quot;</span>.</li>
  <li>Mixing UTF-8 and non-UTF-8 strings is tricky. Use
      <span class="Li">&quot;bytes_to_utf8&quot;</span> to get a new string
      which is UTF-8 encoded, and then combine them.</li>

<h1 class="Sh" id="Custom_Operators"><a class="permalink" href="#Custom_Operators">Custom
  Operators</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Custom operator support is an experimental feature that allows you
    to define your own ops. This is primarily to allow the building of
    interpreters for other languages in the Perl core, but it also allows
    optimizations through the creation of &quot;macro-ops&quot; (ops which
    perform the functions of multiple ops which are usually executed together,
    such as <span class="Li">&quot;gvsv, gvsv, add&quot;</span>.)</p>
<p class="Pp">This feature is implemented as a new op type,
    <span class="Li">&quot;OP_CUSTOM&quot;</span>. The Perl core does not
    &quot;know&quot; anything special about this op type, and so it will not be
    involved in any optimizations. This also means that you can define your
    custom ops to be any op structure - unary, binary, list and so on - you
    like.</p>
<p class="Pp">It's important to know what custom operators won't do for you.
    They won't let you add new syntax to Perl, directly. They won't even let you
    add new keywords, directly. In fact, they won't change the way Perl compiles
    a program at all. You have to do those changes yourself, after Perl has
    compiled the program. You do this either by manipulating the op tree using a
    <span class="Li">&quot;CHECK&quot;</span> block and the
    <span class="Li">&quot;B::Generate&quot;</span> module, or by adding a
    custom peephole optimizer with the
    <span class="Li">&quot;optimize&quot;</span> module.</p>
<p class="Pp">When you do this, you replace ordinary Perl ops with custom ops by
    creating ops with the type <span class="Li">&quot;OP_CUSTOM&quot;</span> and
    the <span class="Li">&quot;op_ppaddr&quot;</span> of your own PP function.
    This should be defined in XS code, and should look like the PP ops in
    <span class="Li">&quot;pp_*.c&quot;</span>. You are responsible for ensuring
    that your op takes the appropriate number of values from the stack, and you
    are responsible for adding stack marks if necessary.</p>
<p class="Pp">You should also &quot;register&quot; your op with the Perl
    interpreter so that it can produce sensible error and warning messages.
    Since it is possible to have multiple custom ops within the one
    &quot;logical&quot; op type <span class="Li">&quot;OP_CUSTOM&quot;</span>,
    Perl uses the value of <span class="Li">&quot;o-&gt;op_ppaddr&quot;</span>
    to determine which custom op it is dealing with. You should create an
    <span class="Li">&quot;XOP&quot;</span> structure for each ppaddr you use,
    set the properties of the custom op with
    <span class="Li">&quot;XopENTRY_set&quot;</span>, and register the structure
    against the ppaddr using
    <span class="Li">&quot;Perl_custom_op_register&quot;</span>. A trivial
    example might look like:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    static XOP my_xop;
    static OP *my_pp(pTHX);
    BOOT:
        XopENTRY_set(&amp;my_xop, xop_name, &quot;myxop&quot;);
        XopENTRY_set(&amp;my_xop, xop_desc, &quot;Useless custom op&quot;);
        Perl_custom_op_register(aTHX_ my_pp, &amp;my_xop);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The available fields in the structure are:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="xop_name"><a class="permalink" href="#xop_name">xop_name</a></dt>
  <dd>A short name for your op. This will be included in some error messages,
      and will also be returned as
      <span class="Li">&quot;$op-&gt;name&quot;</span> by the B module, so it
      will appear in the output of module like B::Concise.</dd>
  <dt id="xop_desc"><a class="permalink" href="#xop_desc">xop_desc</a></dt>
