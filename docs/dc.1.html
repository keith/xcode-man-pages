<i>Dc</i> is a reverse-polish desk calculator which supports unlimited precision
  arithmetic. It also allows you to define and call macros. Normally <i>dc</i>
  reads from the standard input; if any command arguments are given to it, they
  are filenames, and <i>dc</i> reads and executes the contents of the files
  before reading from standard input. All normal output is to standard output;
  all error output is to standard error.
<p class="Pp">A reverse-polish calculator stores numbers on a stack. Entering a
    number pushes it on the stack. Arithmetic operations pop arguments off the
    stack and push the results.</p>
<p class="Pp">To enter a number in <i>dc</i>, type the digits with an optional
    decimal point. Exponential notation is not supported. To enter a negative
    number, begin the number with ``_''. ``-'' cannot be used for this, as it is
    a binary operator for subtraction instead. To enter two numbers in
    succession, separate them with spaces or newlines. These have no meaning as
    commands.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
<i>Dc</i> may be invoked with the following command-line options:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>-V</b></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>--version</b></dt>
  <dd>Print out the version of <i>dc</i> that is being run and a copyright
      notice, then exit.</dd>
  <dt><b>-h</b></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>--help</b></dt>
  <dd>Print a usage message briefly summarizing these command-line options and
      the bug-reporting address, then exit.</dd>
  <dt><b>-e <i>script</i></b></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>--expression=</b><i>script</i></dt>
  <dd>Add the commands in <i>script</i> to the set of commands to be run while
      processing the input.</dd>
  <dt><b>-f <i>script-file</i></b></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>--file=</b><i>script-file</i></dt>
  <dd>Add the commands contained in the file <i>script-file</i> to the set of
      commands to be run while processing the input.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">If any command-line parameters remain after processing the above,
    these parameters are interpreted as the names of input files to be
    processed. A file name of <b>-</b> refers to the standard input stream. The
    standard input will processed if no file names are specified.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="Printing_Commands"><a class="permalink" href="#Printing_Commands">Printing
  Commands</a></h1>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>p</b></dt>
  <dd>Prints the value on the top of the stack, without altering the stack. A
      newline is printed after the value.</dd>
  <dt><b>n</b></dt>
  <dd>Prints the value on the top of the stack, popping it off, and does not
      print a newline after.</dd>
  <dt><b>P</b></dt>
  <dd>Pops off the value on top of the stack. If it it a string, it is simply
      printed without a trailing newline. Otherwise it is a number, and the
      integer portion of its absolute value is printed out as a &quot;base
      (UCHAR_MAX+1)&quot; byte stream. Assuming that (UCHAR_MAX+1) is 256 (as it
      is on most machines with 8-bit bytes), the sequence <b>KSK 0k1/ [_1*]sx
      d0&gt;x [256~aPd0&lt;x]dsxx sxLKk</b> could also accomplish this function,
      except for the side-effect of clobbering the x register.</dd>
  <dt><b>f</b></dt>
  <dd>Prints the entire contents of the stack without altering anything. This is
      a good command to use if you are lost or want to figure out what the
      effect of some command has been.</dd>

<h1 class="Sh" id="Arithmetic"><a class="permalink" href="#Arithmetic">Arithmetic</a></h1>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>+</b></dt>
  <dd>Pops two values off the stack, adds them, and pushes the result. The
      precision of the result is determined only by the values of the arguments,
      and is enough to be exact.</dd>
  <dt><b>-</b></dt>
  <dd>Pops two values, subtracts the first one popped from the second one
      popped, and pushes the result.</dd>
  <dt><b>*</b></dt>
  <dd>Pops two values, multiplies them, and pushes the result. The number of
      fraction digits in the result depends on the current precision value and
      the number of fraction digits in the two arguments.</dd>
  <dt><b>/</b></dt>
  <dd>Pops two values, divides the second one popped from the first one popped,
      and pushes the result. The number of fraction digits is specified by the
      precision value.</dd>
  <dt><b>%</b></dt>
  <dd>Pops two values, computes the remainder of the division that the <b>/</b>
      command would do, and pushes that. The value computed is the same as that
      computed by the sequence <b>Sd dld/ Ld*-</b> .</dd>
  <dt><b>~</b></dt>
  <dd>Pops two values, divides the second one popped from the first one popped.
      The quotient is pushed first, and the remainder is pushed next. The number
      of fraction digits used in the division is specified by the precision
      value. (The sequence <b>SdSn lnld/ LnLd%</b> could also accomplish this
      function, with slightly different error checking.)</dd>
  <dt><b>^</b></dt>
  <dd>Pops two values and exponentiates, using the first value popped as the
      exponent and the second popped as the base. The fraction part of the
      exponent is ignored. The precision value specifies the number of fraction
      digits in the result.</dd>
  <dt><b>|</b></dt>
  <dd>Pops three values and computes a modular exponentiation. The first value
      popped is used as the reduction modulus; this value must be a non-zero
      number, and should be an integer. The second popped is used as the
      exponent; this value must be a non-negative number, and any fractional
      part of this exponent will be ignored. The third value popped is the base
      which gets exponentiated, which should be an integer. For small integers
      this is like the sequence <b>Sm^Lm%</b>, but, unlike <b>^</b>, this
      command will work with arbitrarily large exponents.</dd>
  <dt><b>v</b></dt>
  <dd>Pops one value, computes its square root, and pushes that. The precision
      value specifies the number of fraction digits in the result.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Most arithmetic operations are affected by the ``precision
    value'', which you can set with the <b>k</b> command. The default precision
    value is zero, which means that all arithmetic except for addition and
    subtraction produces integer results.</p>

      Thus, ``4d*p'' computes 4 squared and prints it.</dd>

<h1 class="Sh" id="Registers"><a class="permalink" href="#Registers">Registers</a></h1>
<i>Dc</i> provides at least 256 memory registers, each named by a single
  character. You can store a number or a string in a register and retrieve it
  later.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>s</b><i>r</i></dt>
  <dd>Pop the value off the top of the stack and store it into register
      <i>r</i>.</dd>
  <dt><b>l</b><i>r</i></dt>
  <dd>Copy the value in register <i>r</i> and push it onto the stack. This does
      not alter the contents of <i>r</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Each register also contains its own stack. The current register
    value is the top of the register's stack.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>S</b><i>r</i></dt>
  <dd>Pop the value off the top of the (main) stack and push it onto the stack
      of register <i>r</i>. The previous value of the register becomes
      inaccessible.</dd>
  <dt><b>L</b><i>r</i></dt>
  <dd>Pop the value off the top of register <i>r</i>'s stack and push it onto
      the main stack. The previous value in register <i>r</i>'s stack, if any,
      is now accessible via the <b>l</b><i>r</i> command.</dd>
</dl>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="Parameters"><a class="permalink" href="#Parameters">Parameters</a></h1>
<i>Dc</i> has three parameters that control its operation: the precision, the
  input radix, and the output radix. The precision specifies the number of
  fraction digits to keep in the result of most arithmetic operations. The input
  radix controls the interpretation of numbers typed in; all numbers typed in
  use this radix. The output radix is used for printing numbers.
<p class="Pp">The input and output radices are separate parameters; you can make
    them unequal, which can be useful or confusing. The input radix must be
    between 2 and 16 inclusive. The output radix must be at least 2. The
    precision must be zero or greater. The precision is always measured in
    decimal digits, regardless of the current input or output radix.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>i</b></dt>
  <dd>Pops the value off the top of the stack and uses it to set the input
      radix.</dd>
  <dt><b>o</b></dt>
  <dd>Pops the value off the top of the stack and uses it to set the output
      radix.</dd>
  <dt><b>k</b></dt>
  <dd>Pops the value off the top of the stack and uses it to set the
    precision.</dd>
  <dt><b>I</b></dt>
  <dd>Pushes the current input radix on the stack.</dd>
  <dt><b>O</b></dt>
  <dd>Pushes the current output radix on the stack.</dd>
  <dt><b>K</b></dt>
  <dd>Pushes the current precision on the stack.</dd>
</dl>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="Strings"><a class="permalink" href="#Strings">Strings</a></h1>
<i>Dc</i> can operate on strings as well as on numbers. The only things you can
  do with strings are print them and execute them as macros (which means that
  the contents of the string are processed as <i>dc</i> commands). All registers
  and the stack can hold strings, and <i>dc</i> always knows whether any given
  object is a string or a number. Some commands such as arithmetic operations
  demand numbers as arguments and print errors if given strings. Other commands
  can accept either a number or a string; for example, the <b>p</b> command can
  accept either and prints the object according to its type.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>[</b><i>characters</i><b>]</b></dt>
  <dd>Makes a string containing <i>characters</i> (contained between balanced
      <b>[</b> and <b>]</b> characters), and pushes it on the stack. For
      example, <b>[foo]P</b> prints the characters <b>foo</b> (with no
    newline).</dd>
  <dt><b>a</b></dt>
  <dd>The top-of-stack is popped. If it was a number, then the low-order byte of
      this number is converted into a string and pushed onto the stack.
      Otherwise the top-of-stack was a string, and the first character of that
      string is pushed back.</dd>
  <dt><b>x</b></dt>
  <dd>Pops a value off the stack and executes it as a macro. Normally it should
      be a string; if it is a number, it is simply pushed back onto the stack.
      For example, <b>[1p]x</b> executes the macro <b>1p</b> which pushes
      <b>1</b> on the stack and prints <b>1</b> on a separate line.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Macros are most often stored in registers; <b>[1p]sa</b> stores a
    macro to print <b>1</b> into register <b>a</b>, and <b>lax</b> invokes this
    macro.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>&gt;</b><i>r</i></dt>
  <dd>Pops two values off the stack and compares them assuming they are numbers,
      executing the contents of register <i>r</i> as a macro if the original
      top-of-stack is greater. Thus, <b>1 2&gt;a</b> will invoke register
      <b>a</b>'s contents and <b>2 1&gt;a</b> will not.</dd>
  <dt><b>!&gt;</b><i>r</i></dt>
  <dd>Similar but invokes the macro if the original top-of-stack is not greater
      than (less than or equal to) what was the second-to-top.</dd>
  <dt><b>&lt;</b><i>r</i></dt>
  <dd>Similar but invokes the macro if the original top-of-stack is less.</dd>
  <dt><b>!&lt;</b><i>r</i></dt>
  <dd>Similar but invokes the macro if the original top-of-stack is not less
      than (greater than or equal to) what was the second-to-top.</dd>
  <dt><b>=</b><i>r</i></dt>
  <dd>Similar but invokes the macro if the two numbers popped are equal.</dd>
  <dt><b>!=</b><i>r</i></dt>
  <dd>Similar but invokes the macro if the two numbers popped are not
    equal.</dd>
  <dt><b>?</b></dt>
  <dd>Reads a line from the terminal and executes it. This command allows a
      macro to request input from the user.</dd>
  <dt><b>q</b></dt>
  <dd>exits from a macro and also from the macro which invoked it. If called
      from the top level, or from a macro which was called directly from the top
      level, the <b>q</b> command will cause <i>dc</i> to exit.</dd>
  <dt><b>Q</b></dt>
  <dd>Pops a value off the stack and uses it as a count of levels of macro
      execution to be exited. Thus, <b>3Q</b> exits three levels. The <b>Q</b>
      command will never cause <i>dc</i> to exit.</dd>

      the !.</dd>
