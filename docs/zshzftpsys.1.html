zshzftpsys - zftp function front-end
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
This describes the set of shell functions supplied with the source distribution
  as an interface to the <b>zftp</b> builtin command, allowing you to perform
  FTP operations from the shell command line or within functions or scripts. The
  interface is similar to a traditional FTP client (e.g. the <b>ftp</b> command
  itself, see <i>ftp</i>(1)), but as it is entirely done within the shell all
  the familiar completion, editing and globbing features, and so on, are
  present, and macros are particularly simple to write as they are just ordinary
  shell functions.
<p class="Pp">The prerequisite is that the <b>zftp</b> command, as described in
    <i>zshmodules</i>(1) , must be available in the version of <b>zsh</b>
    installed at your site. If the shell is configured to load new commands at
    run time, it probably is: typing `<b>zmodload zsh/zftp</b>' will make sure
    (if that runs silently, it has worked). If this is not the case, it is
    possible <b>zftp</b> was linked into the shell anyway: to test this, type
    `<b>which zftp</b>' and if <b>zftp</b> is available you will get the message
    `<b>zftp: shell built-in command</b>'.</p>
<p class="Pp">Commands given directly with <b>zftp</b> builtin may be
    interspersed between the functions in this suite; in a few cases, using
    <b>zftp</b> directly may cause some of the status information stored in
    shell parameters to become invalid. Note in particular the description of
    the variables <b>$ZFTP_TMOUT</b>, <b>$ZFTP_PREFS</b> and
    <b>$ZFTP_VERBOSE</b> for <b>zftp</b>.</p>

You should make sure all the functions from the <b>Functions/Zftp</b> directory
  of the source distribution are available; they all begin with the two letters
  `<b>zf</b>'. They may already have been installed on your system; otherwise,
  you will need to find them and copy them. The directory should appear as one
  of the elements of the <b>$fpath</b> array (this should already be the case if
  they were installed), and at least the function <b>zfinit</b> should be
  autoloaded; it will autoload the rest. Finally, to initialize the use of the
  system you need to call the <b>zfinit</b> function. The following code in your
  <b>.zshrc</b> will arrange for this; assume the functions are stored in the
  directory <b>~/myfns</b>:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b>fpath=(~/myfns $fpath)</b>
<b>autoload -U zfinit</b>
<b>zfinit</b>
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Note that <b>zfinit</b> assumes you are using the <b>zmodload</b>
    method to load the <b>zftp</b> command. If it is already built into the
    shell, change <b>zfinit</b> to <b>zfinit -n</b>. It is helpful (though not
    essential) if the call to <b>zfinit</b> appears after any code to initialize
    the new completion system, else unnecessary <b>compctl</b> commands will be
    given.</p>

The sequence of operations in performing a file transfer is essentially the same
  as that in a standard FTP client. Note that, due to a quirk of the shell's
  <b>getopts</b> builtin, for those functions that handle options you must use
  `<b>-</b><b>-</b>' rather than `<b>-</b>' to ensure the remaining arguments
  are treated literally (a single `<b>-</b>' is treated as an argument).

<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">If the command was successful, and the terminal is compatible with

    this is handled by the function <b>zftp_chpwd</b>, described below.</p>
<p class="Pp">Normally, the <i>host</i>, <i>user</i> and <i>password</i> are
    internally recorded for later re-opening, either by a <b>zfopen</b> with no
    arguments, or automatically (see below). With the option `<b>-1</b>', no
    information is stored. Also, if an open command with arguments failed, the

</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">In the first form with <i>dir</i> present, change to the directory
    <i>dir</i>. The command `<b>zfcd ..</b>' is treated specially, so is
    guaranteed to work on non-UNIX servers (note this is handled internally by
    <b>zftp</b>). If <i>dir</i> is omitted, has the effect of `<b>zfcd
  ~</b>'.</p>
<p class="Pp">The second form changes to the directory previously current.</p>
<p class="Pp">The third form attempts to change the current directory by
    replacing the first occurrence of the string <i>old</i> with the string
    <i>new</i> in the current directory.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that in this command, and indeed anywhere a remote filename
    is expected, the string which on the local host corresponds to `<b>~</b>' is
    converted back to a `<b>~</b>' before being passed to the remote machine.
    This is convenient because of the way expansion is performed on the command
    line before <b>zfcd</b> receives a string. For example, suppose the command
    is `<b>zfcd ~/foo</b>'. The shell will expand this to a full path such as
    `<b>zfcd /home/user2/pws/foo</b>'. At this stage, <b>zfcd</b> recognises the
    initial path as corresponding to `<b>~</b>' and will send the directory to
    the remote host as <b>~/foo</b>, so that the `<b>~</b>' will be expanded by
    the server to the correct remote host directory. Other named directories of

      implementation dependent, but specifying a particular remote directory
      <i>dir</i> is usually possible. The output is passed through a pager given
      by the environment variable <b>$PAGER</b>, or `<b>more</b>' if that is not
      set.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">The directory is usually cached for re-use. In fact, two caches
    are maintained. One is for use when there is no <i>dir-options</i> or
    <i>dir</i>, i.e. a full listing of the current remote directory; it is
    flushed when the current remote directory changes. The other is kept for
    repeated use of <b>zfdir</b> with the same arguments; for example, repeated
    use of `<b>zfdir /pub/gnu</b>' will only require the directory to be
    retrieved on the first call. Alternatively, this cache can be re-viewed with
    the <b>-r</b> option. As relative directories will confuse <b>zfdir</b>, the
    <b>-f</b> option can be used to force the cache to be flushed before the
    directory is listed. The option <b>-d</b> will delete both caches without
    showing a directory listing; it will also delete the cache of file names in
    the current remote directory, if any.</p>

The commands for retrieving files all take at least two options. <b>-G</b>
  suppresses remote filename expansion which would otherwise be performed (see
  below for a more detailed description of that). <b>-t</b> attempts to set the
  modification time of the local file to that of the remote file: see the
  description of the function <b>zfrtime</b> below for more information.

      remote server. If a file contains a `<b>/</b>', the full name is passed to
      the remote server, but the file is stored locally under the name given by
      the part after the final `<b>/</b>'. The option <b>-c</b> (cat) forces all
      files to be sent as a single stream to standard output; in this case the
      <b>-t</b> option has no effect.</dd>

  <dd>As <b>zfget</b>, but only retrieve files where the version on the remote

      does not exist. If the remote file is older but the files have different
      sizes, or if the sizes are the same but the remote file is newer, the user
      will usually be queried. With the option <b>-s</b>, the command runs
      silently and will always retrieve the file in either of those two cases.
      With the option <b>-v</b>, the command prints more information about the
      files while it is working out whether or not to transfer them.</dd>
  <dt><b>zfcget</b> [ <b>-Gt</b> ] <i>file1</i> ...</dt>
  <dd>As <b>zfget</b>, but if any of the local files exists, and is shorter than

      internal host/user/password parameters must also be correctly set.</dd>
  <dt><b>zfcd_match </b><i>prefix</i><b> </b><i>suffix</i><b></b><i></i></dt>
  <dd>This performs matching for completion of remote directory names. If the
      remote server is UNIX, it will attempt to persuade the server to list the
      remote directory with subdirectories marked, which usually works but is
      not guaranteed. On other hosts it simply calls <b>zfget_match</b> and
      hence completes all files, not just directories. On some systems,
      directories may not even look like filenames.</dd>
  <dt><b>zfget_match </b><i>prefix</i><b> </b><i>suffix</i><b></b><i></i></dt>
  <dd>This performs matching for completion of remote filenames. It caches files
      for the current directory (only) in the shell parameter
      <b>$zftp_fcache</b>. It is in the form to be called by the <b>-K</b>
      option of <b>compctl</b>, but also works when called from a widget-style
      completion function with <i>prefix</i> and <i>suffix</i> set
      appropriately.</dd>
  <dt><b>zfrglob </b><i>varname</i><b></b><i></i></dt>
  <dd>Perform remote globbing, as describes in more detail below. <i>varname</i>
      is the name of a variable containing the pattern to be expanded; if there
      were any matches, the same variable will be set to the expanded set of
      filenames on return.</dd>
  <dt><b>zfrtime</b> <i>lfile</i> <i>rfile</i> [ <i>time</i> ]</dt>
  <dd>Set the local file <i>lfile</i> to have the same modification time as the
      remote file <i>rfile</i>, or the explicit time <i>time</i> in FTP format
      <b>CCYYMMDDhhmmSS</b> for the GMT timezone. This uses the shell's
      <b>zsh/datetime</b> module to perform the conversion from GMT to local
      time.</dd>
  <dt><b>zftp_chpwd</b></dt>
  <dd>This function is called every time a connection is opened, or closed, or
      the remote directory changes. This version alters the title bar of an
      <b>xterm</b>-compatible or <b>sun-cmd</b> terminal emulator to reflect the
      local and remote hostnames and current directories. It works best when
      combined with the function <b>chpwd</b>. In particular, a function of the

  <dd>This function shows the status of the transfer. It will not write anything

      in the background, you should turn off progress reports by hand using
      `<b>zstyle ':zftp:*' progress none</b>'. Note also that if you alter it,
      any output <i>must</i> be to standard error, as standard output may be a

      at all, can be configured without altering the function, as described in
      the next section.</dd>

Various styles are available using the standard shell style mechanism, described
  in <i>zshmodules</i>(1). Briefly, the command `<b>zstyle ':zftp:*'</b>
  <i>style</i> <i>value</i> ...'. defines the <i>style</i> to have value
  <i>value</i>; more than one value may be given, although that is not useful in
  the cases described here. These values will then be used throughout the zftp
  function system. For more precise control, the first argument, which gives a
  context in which the style applies, can be modified to include a particular
  function, as for example `<b>:zftp:zfget</b>': the style will then have the
  given value only in the <b>zfget</b> function. Values for the same style in
  different contexts may be set; the most specific function will be used, where
  strings are held to be more specific than patterns, and longer patterns and
  shorter patterns. Note that only the top level function name, as called by the
  user, is used; calling of lower level functions is transparent to the user.
  Hence modifications to the title bar in <b>zftp_chpwd</b> use the contexts
  <b>:zftp:zfopen</b>, <b>:zftp:zfcd</b>, etc., depending where it was called
  from. The following styles are understood:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>progress</b></dt>
  <dd>Controls the way that <b>zftp_progress</b> reports on the progress of a
      transfer. If empty, unset, or `<b>none</b>', no progress report is made;
      if `<b>bar</b>' a growing bar of inverse video is shown; if
      `<b>percent</b>' (or any other string, though this may change in future),
      the percentage of the file transferred is shown. The bar meter requires
      that the width of the terminal be available via the <b>$COLUMNS</b>
      parameter (normally this is set automatically). If the size of the file
      being transferred is not available, <b>bar</b> and <b>percent</b> meters
      will simply show the number of bytes transferred so far.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">When <b>zfinit</b> is run, if this style is not defined for the
    context <b>:zftp:*</b>, it will be set to `bar'.</p>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>update</b></dt>
  <dd>Specifies the minimum time interval between updates of the progress meter
      in seconds. No update is made unless new data has been received, so the
      actual time interval is limited only by <b>$ZFTP_TIMEOUT</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">As described for <b>progress</b>, <b>zfinit</b> will force this to
    default to 1.</p>

<dl class="Bl-tag">

  <dd>If set to `<b>1</b>', `<b>yes</b>' or `<b>true</b>', filename generation
      (globbing) is performed on the remote machine instead of by zsh itself;
      see below.</dd>
  <dt><b>titlebar</b></dt>
  <dd>If set to `<b>1</b>', `<b>yes</b>' or `<b>true</b>', <b>zftp_chpwd</b>

<div class="Bd-indent">

      if the remote host details were put into the terminal title bar by
      <b>zftp_chpwd</b> and your usual <b>chpwd</b> also modifies the title
    bar.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">When <b>zfinit</b> is run, it will determine whether <b>chpwd</b>
    exists and if so it will set the default value for the style to 1 if none

<p class="Pp">Note that there is also an associative array <b>zfconfig</b> which
    contains values used by the function system. This should not be modified or
    overwritten.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Remote_globbing"><a class="permalink" href="#Remote_globbing">Remote
  globbing</a></h2>
The commands for retrieving files usually perform filename generation (globbing)
  on their arguments; this can be turned off by passing the option <b>-G</b> to
  each of the commands. Normally this operates by retrieving a complete list of
  files for the directory in question, then matching these locally against the
  pattern supplied. This has the advantage that the full range of zsh patterns
  (respecting the setting of the option <b>EXTENDED_GLOB</b>) can be used.
  However, it means that the directory part of a filename will not be expanded
  and must be given exactly. If the remote server does not support the UNIX
  directory semantics, directory handling is problematic and it is recommended
  that globbing only be used within the current directory. The list of files in
  the current directory, if retrieved, will be cached, so that subsequent globs
  in the same directory without an intervening <b>zfcd</b> are much faster.
<p class="Pp">If the <b>remote-glob</b> style (see above) is set, globbing is
    instead performed on the remote host: the server is asked for a list of
    matching files. This is highly dependent on how the server is implemented,
    though typically UNIX servers will provide support for basic glob patterns.
    This may in some cases be faster, as it avoids retrieving the entire list of
    directory contents.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Automatic_and_temporary_reopening"><a class="permalink" href="#Automatic_and_temporary_reopening">Automatic
  and temporary reopening</a></h2>
As described for the <b>zfopen</b> command, a subsequent <b>zfopen</b> with no
  parameters will reopen the connection to the last host (this includes
  connections made with the <b>zfanon</b> command). Opened in this fashion, the
  connection starts in the default remote directory and will remain open until
  explicitly closed.
<p class="Pp">Automatic re-opening is also available. If a connection is not
    currently open and a command requiring a connection is given, the last
    connection is implicitly reopened. In this case the directory which was
    current when the connection was closed again becomes the current directory
    (unless, of course, the command given changes it). Automatic reopening will
    also take place if the connection was close by the remote server for
    whatever reason (e.g. a timeout). It is not available if the <b>-1</b>
    option to <b>zfopen</b> or <b>zfanon</b> was used.</p>
<p class="Pp">Furthermore, if the command issued is a file transfer, the
    connection will be closed after the transfer is finished, hence providing a
    one-shot mode for transfers. This does not apply to directory changing or
    listing commands; for example a <b>zfdir</b> may reopen a connection but
    will leave it open. Also, automatic closure will only ever happen in the
    same command as automatic opening, i.e a <b>zfdir</b> directly followed by a
    <b>zfget</b> will never close the connection automatically.</p>
<p class="Pp">Information about the previous connection is given by the
    <b>zfstat</b> function. So, for example, if that reports:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b>Session:        default</b>
<b>Not connected.</b>
<b>Last session:   ftp.bar.com:/pub/textfiles</b>
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">then the command <b>zfget file.txt</b> will attempt to reopen a
    connection to <b>ftp.bar.com</b>, retrieve the file
    <b>/pub/textfiles/file.txt</b>, and immediately close the connection again.
    On the other hand, <b>zfcd ..</b> will open the connection in the directory
    <b>/pub</b> and leave it open.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that all the above is local to each session; if you return to
    a previous session, the connection for that session is the one which will be
    reopened.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Completion"><a class="permalink" href="#Completion">Completion</a></h2>
Completion of local and remote files, directories, sessions and bookmarks is
  supported. The older, <b>compctl</b>-style completion is defined when
  <b>zfinit</b> is called; support for the new widget-based completion system is
  provided in the function <b>Completion/Zsh/Command/_zftp</b>, which should be
  installed with the other functions of the completion system and hence should
  automatically be available.
