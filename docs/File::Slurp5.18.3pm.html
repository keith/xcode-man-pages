<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
This module provides subs that allow you to read or write entire files with one
  simple call. They are designed to be simple to use, have flexible ways to pass
  in or get the file contents and to be very efficient. There is also a sub to
  read in all the files in a directory other than
  <span class="Li">&quot;.&quot;</span> and
  <span class="Li">&quot;..&quot;</span>
<p class="Pp">These slurp/spew subs work for files, pipes and sockets, stdio,
    pseudo-files, and the DATA handle. Read more about why slurping files is a
    good thing in the file 'slurp_article.pod' in the extras/ directory.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you are interested in how fast these calls work, check out the
    slurp_bench.pl program in the extras/ directory. It compares many different
    forms of slurping. You can select the I/O direction, context and file sizes.
    Use the --help option to see how to run it.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="_fBread_file_fP"><a class="permalink" href="#_fBread_file_fP"><b>read_file</b></a></h2>
This sub reads in an entire file and returns its contents to the caller. In
  scalar context it returns the entire file as a single scalar. In list context
  it will return a list of lines (using the current value of $/ as the separator
  including support for paragraph mode when it is set to '').
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  my $text = read_file( 'filename' ) ;
  my $bin = read_file( 'filename' { binmode =&gt; ':raw' } ) ;
  my @lines = read_file( 'filename' ) ;
  my $lines = read_file( 'filename', array_ref =&gt; 1 ) ;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The first argument is the file to slurp in. If the next argument
    is a hash reference, then it is used as the options. Otherwise the rest of
    the argument list are is used as key/value options.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the file argument is a handle (if it is a ref and is an IO or
    GLOB object), then that handle is slurped in. This mode is supported so you
    slurp handles such as <span class="Li">&quot;DATA&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;STDIN&quot;</span>. See the test handle.t for an
    example that does <span class="Li">&quot;open( '-|' )&quot;</span> and the
    child process spews data to the parant which slurps it in. All of the
    options that control how the data is returned to the caller still work in
    this case.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the first argument is an overloaded object then its stringified
    value is used for the filename and that file is opened. This is a new
    feature in 9999.14. See the stringify.t test for an example.</p>
<p class="Pp">By default <span class="Li">&quot;read_file&quot;</span> returns
    an undef in scalar contex or a single undef in list context if it encounters
    an error. Those are both impossible to get with a clean read_file call which
    means you can check the return value and always know if you had an error.
    You can change how errors are handled with the
    <span class="Li">&quot;err_mode&quot;</span> option.</p>
<p class="Pp">Speed Note: If you call read_file and just get a scalar return
    value it is now optimized to handle shorter files. This is only used if no
    options are used, the file is shorter then 100k bytes, the filename is a
    plain scalar and a scalar file is returned. If you want the fastest
    slurping, use the <span class="Li">&quot;buf_ref&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;scalar_ref&quot;</span> options (see below)</p>
<p class="Pp">NOTE: as of version 9999.06, read_file works correctly on the
    <span class="Li">&quot;DATA&quot;</span> handle. It used to need a sysseek
    workaround but that is now handled when needed by the module itself.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can optionally request that
    <span class="Li">&quot;slurp()&quot;</span> is exported to your code. This
    is an alias for read_file and is meant to be forward compatible with Perl 6
    (which will have <i>slurp()</i> built-in).</p>
<p class="Pp">The options for <span class="Li">&quot;read_file&quot;</span>
  are:</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>binmode</i></p>
<p class="Pp">If you set the binmode option, then its value is passed to a call
    to binmode on the opened handle. You can use this to set the file to be read
    in binary mode, utf8, etc. See perldoc -f binmode for more.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
        my $bin_data = read_file( $bin_file, binmode =&gt; ':raw' ) ;
        my $utf_text = read_file( $bin_file, binmode =&gt; ':utf8' ) ;
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><i>array_ref</i></p>
<p class="Pp">If this boolean option is set, the return value (only in scalar
    context) will be an array reference which contains the lines of the slurped
    file. The following two calls are equivalent:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
        my $lines_ref = read_file( $bin_file, array_ref =&gt; 1 ) ;
        my $lines_ref = [ read_file( $bin_file ) ] ;
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><i>chomp</i></p>
<p class="Pp">If this boolean option is set, the lines are chomped. This only
    happens if you are slurping in a list context or using the
    <span class="Li">&quot;array_ref&quot;</span> option.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>scalar_ref</i></p>
<p class="Pp">If this boolean option is set, the return value (only in scalar
    context) will be an scalar reference to a string which is the contents of
    the slurped file. This will usually be faster than returning the plain
    scalar. It will also save memory as it will not make a copy of the file to
    return. Run the extras/slurp_bench.pl script to see speed comparisons.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
        my $text_ref = read_file( $bin_file, scalar_ref =&gt; 1 ) ;
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><i>buf_ref</i></p>
<p class="Pp">You can use this option to pass in a scalar reference and the
    slurped file contents will be stored in the scalar. This can be used in
    conjunction with any of the other options. This saves an extra copy of the
    slurped file and can lower ram usage vs returning the file. It is usually
    the fastest way to read a file into a scalar. Run the extras/slurp_bench.pl
    script to see speed comparisons.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
        read_file( $bin_file, buf_ref =&gt; \$buffer ) ;
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><i>blk_size</i></p>
<p class="Pp">You can use this option to set the block size used when slurping
    from an already open handle (like \*STDIN). It defaults to 1MB.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
        my $text_ref = read_file( $bin_file, blk_size =&gt; 10_000_000,
                                             array_ref =&gt; 1 ) ;
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><i>err_mode</i></p>
<p class="Pp">You can use this option to control how read_file behaves when an
    error occurs. This option defaults to 'croak'. You can set it to 'carp' or
    to 'quiet to have no special error handling. This code wants to carp and
    then read another file if it fails.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
        my $text_ref = read_file( $file, err_mode =&gt; 'carp' ) ;
        unless ( $text_ref ) {

                # read a different file but croak if not found
                $text_ref = read_file( $another_file ) ;

</pre>
<p class="Pp">The first argument to
    <span class="Li">&quot;write_file&quot;</span> is the filename. The next
    argument is an optional hash reference and it contains key/values that can
    modify the behavior of <span class="Li">&quot;write_file&quot;</span>. The
    rest of the argument list is the data to be written to the file.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>

  write_file( 'filename', {binmode =&gt; ':raw'}, $buffer ) ;

<p class="Pp">As a shortcut if the first data argument is a scalar or array
    reference, it is used as the only data to be written to the file. Any
    following arguments in <span class="Li">@_</span> are ignored. This is a

    to the <span class="Li">&quot;buf_ref&quot;</span> option of
    <span class="Li">&quot;read_file&quot;</span>. These following pairs are
    equivalent but the pass by reference call will be faster in most cases

  write_file( 'filename', \$buffer ) ;
  write_file( 'filename', $buffer ) ;

</pre>
<p class="Pp">If the first argument is a handle (if it is a ref and is an IO or
    GLOB object), then that handle is written to. This mode is supported so you
    spew to handles such as \*STDOUT. See the test handle.t for an example that
    does <span class="Li">&quot;open( '-|' )&quot;</span> and child process
    spews data to the parent which slurps it in. All of the options that control
    how the data are passed into <span class="Li">&quot;write_file&quot;</span>
    still work in this case.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the first argument is an overloaded object then its stringified
    value is used for the filename and that file is opened. This is new feature
    in 9999.14. See the stringify.t test for an example.</p>
<p class="Pp">By default <span class="Li">&quot;write_file&quot;</span> returns
    1 upon successfully writing the file or undef if it encountered an error.
    You can change how errors are handled with the
    <span class="Li">&quot;err_mode&quot;</span> option.</p>
<p class="Pp">The options are:</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>binmode</i></p>
<p class="Pp">If you set the binmode option, then its value is passed to a call
    to binmode on the opened handle. You can use this to set the file to be read

</pre>
<p class="Pp"><i>perms</i></p>
<p class="Pp">The perms option sets the permissions of newly-created files. This
    value is modified by your process's umask and defaults to 0666 (same as
    sysopen).</p>
<p class="Pp">NOTE: this option is new as of File::Slurp version 9999.14;</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>buf_ref</i></p>
<p class="Pp">You can use this option to pass in a scalar reference which has
    the data to be written. If this is set then any data arguments (including

</pre>
<p class="Pp"><i>atomic</i></p>
<p class="Pp">If you set this boolean option, the file will be written to in an
    atomic fashion. A temporary file name is created by appending the pid ($$)
    to the file name argument and that file is spewed to. After the file is
    closed it is renamed to the original file name (and rename is an atomic
    operation on most OS's). If the program using this were to crash in the
    middle of this, then the file with the pid suffix could be left behind.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>append</i></p>
<p class="Pp">If you set this boolean option, the data will be written at the
    end of the current file. Internally this sets the sysopen mode flag
    O_APPEND.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
        write_file( $file, {append =&gt; 1}, @data ) ;

 You
can import append_file and it does the same thing.

<h2 class="Ss" id="overwrite_file"><a class="permalink" href="#overwrite_file">overwrite_file</a></h2>
This sub is just a typeglob alias to write_file since write_file always
  overwrites an existing file. This sub is supported for backwards compatibility
  with the original version of this module. See write_file for its API and
  behavior.
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="append_file"><a class="permalink" href="#append_file">append_file</a></h2>
This sub will write its data to the end of the file. It is a wrapper around
  write_file and it has the same API so see that for the full documentation.
  These calls are equivalent:
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="prepend_file"><a class="permalink" href="#prepend_file">prepend_file</a></h2>
This sub writes data to the beginning of a file. The previously existing data is
  written after that so the effect is prepending data in front of a file. It is
  a counterpart to the append_file sub in this module. It works by first using
  <span class="Li">&quot;read_file&quot;</span> to slurp in the file and then
  calling <span class="Li">&quot;write_file&quot;</span> with the new data and
  the existing file data.
<p class="Pp">The first argument to
    <span class="Li">&quot;prepend_file&quot;</span> is the filename. The next
    argument is an optional hash reference and it contains key/values that can
    modify the behavior of <span class="Li">&quot;prepend_file&quot;</span>. The
    rest of the argument list is the data to be written to the file and that is
    passed to <span class="Li">&quot;write_file&quot;</span> as is (see that for
    allowed data).</p>
<p class="Pp">Only the <span class="Li">&quot;binmode&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;err_mode&quot;</span> options are supported. The
    <span class="Li">&quot;write_file&quot;</span> call has the
    <span class="Li">&quot;atomic&quot;</span> option set so you will always
    have a consistant file. See above for more about those options.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;prepend_file&quot;</span> is not exported
    by default, you need to import it explicitly.</p>

These subs read in a file into <span class="Li">$_</span>, execute a code block
  which should modify <span class="Li">$_</span> and then write
  <span class="Li">$_</span> back to the file. The difference between them is
  that <span class="Li">&quot;edit_file&quot;</span> reads the whole file into
  <span class="Li">$_</span> and calls the code block one time. With
  <span class="Li">&quot;edit_file_lines&quot;</span> each line is read into
  <span class="Li">$_</span> and the code is called for each line. In both cases
  the code should modify <span class="Li">$_</span> if desired and it will be
  written back out. These subs are the equivalent of the -pi command line
  options of Perl but you can call them from inside your program and not fork
  out a process. They are in <span class="Li">@EXPORT_OK</span> so you need to
  request them to be imported on the use line or you can import both of them
  with:

    code reference. The code block is not followed by a comma (as with grep and
    map) but a code reference is followed by a comma. See the examples below for
    both styles. The next argument is the filename. The last argument is an
    optional hash reference and it contains key/values that can modify the

<p class="Pp">In list context <span class="Li">&quot;read_dir&quot;</span>
    returns a list of the entries in the directory. In a scalar context it

<p class="Pp">If this boolean option is set, the string &quot;$dir/&quot; is
