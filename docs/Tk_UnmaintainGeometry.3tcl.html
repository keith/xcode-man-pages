   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

  	# Set up traps and other miscellaneous stuff for Tcl/Tk man pages.
  	# Start an argument description
  .b
  	# define tabbing values for .AP
  
  	# BS - start boxed text
  	# ^y = starting y location
  	# ^b = 1
  	# BE - end boxed text (draw box now)
  	Draw four-sided box normally, but don't draw top of
  	box if the box started on an earlier page.
  	# VS - start vertical sidebar
  	# ^Y = starting y location
  	# ^v = 1 (for troff;  for nroff this doesn't matter)
  	# VE - end of vertical sidebar
  	# Special macro to handle page bottom:  finish off current
  	# box/sidebar if in box/sidebar mode, then invoked standard
  	# page bottom macro.
  	Draw three-sided box if this is the box's first page,
  	draw two sides but no top otherwise.
  	# DS - begin display

<b>Tk_MaintainGeometry</b> and <b>Tk_UnmaintainGeometry</b> make it easier for
  geometry managers to deal with slaves whose masters are not their parents.
  Three problems arise if the master for a slave is not its parent:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>[1]</dt>
  <dd>The x- and y-position of the slave must be translated from the coordinate
      system of the master to that of the parent before positioning the
    slave.</dd>
  <dt>[2]</dt>
  <dd>If the master window, or any of its ancestors up to the slave's parent, is
      moved, then the slave must be repositioned within its parent in order to
      maintain the correct position relative to the master.</dd>
  <dt>[3]</dt>
  <dd>If the master or one of its ancestors is mapped or unmapped, then the
      slave must be mapped or unmapped to correspond.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">None of these problems is an issue if the parent and master are
    the same. For example, if the master or one of its ancestors is unmapped,
    the slave is automatically removed by the screen by X.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tk_MaintainGeometry</b> deals with these problems for slaves
    whose masters are not their parents, as well as handling the simpler case of
    slaves whose masters are their parents. <b>Tk_MaintainGeometry</b> is
    typically called by a window manager once it has decided where a slave
    should be positioned relative to its master. <b>Tk_MaintainGeometry</b>
    translates the coordinates to the coordinate system of <i>slave</i>'s parent
    and then moves and resizes the slave appropriately. Furthermore, it
    remembers the desired position and creates event handlers to monitor the
    master and all of its ancestors up to (but not including) the slave's
    parent. If any of these windows is moved, mapped, or unmapped, the slave
    will be adjusted so that it is mapped only when the master is mapped and its
    geometry relative to the master remains as specified by <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>,
    <i>width</i>, and <i>height</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">When a window manager relinquishes control over a window, or if it
    decides that it does not want the window to appear on the screen under any
    conditions, it calls <b>Tk_UnmaintainGeometry</b>.
    <b>Tk_UnmaintainGeometry</b> unmaps the window and cancels any previous
    calls to <b>Tk_MaintainGeometry</b> for the <i>master</i>-<i>slave</i> pair,
    so that the slave's geometry and mapped state are no longer maintained
    automatically. <b>Tk_UnmaintainGeometry</b> need not be called by a geometry
    manager if the slave, the master, or any of the master's ancestors is
    destroyed: Tk will call it automatically.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <b>Tk_MaintainGeometry</b> is called repeatedly for the same
    <i>master</i>-<i>slave</i> pair, the information from the most recent call
    supersedes any older information. If <b>Tk_UnmaintainGeometry</b> is called
    for a <i>master</i>-<i>slave</i> pair that is is not currently managed, the
    call has no effect.</p>
