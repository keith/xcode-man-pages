In the first and second form, copy entries from <b>&lt;tree-ish&gt;</b> to the
  index. In the third form, set the current branch head (<b>HEAD</b>) to
  <b>&lt;commit&gt;</b>, optionally modifying index and working tree to match.
  The <b>&lt;tree-ish&gt;</b>/<b>&lt;commit&gt;</b> defaults to <b>HEAD</b> in
  all forms.
<p class="Pp"><i>git reset</i> [-q] [&lt;tree-ish&gt;] [--] &lt;paths&gt;...</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This form resets the index entries for all
  <b>&lt;paths&gt;</b> to their state at <b>&lt;tree-ish&gt;</b>. (It does not
  affect the working tree or the current branch.)
<p class="Pp">This means that <b>git reset &lt;paths&gt;</b> is the opposite of
    <b>git add &lt;paths&gt;</b>. This command is equivalent to <b>git restore
    [--source=&lt;tree-ish&gt;] --staged &lt;paths&gt;...</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">After running <b>git reset &lt;paths&gt;</b> to update the index
    entry, you can use <b>git-restore</b>(1) to check the contents out of the
    index to the working tree. Alternatively, using <b>git-restore</b>(1) and
    specifying a commit with <b>--source</b>, you can copy the contents of a
    path out of a commit to the index and to the working tree in one go.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>git reset</i> (--patch | -p) [&lt;tree-ish&gt;] [--]
    [&lt;paths&gt;...]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Interactively select hunks in the difference between the
  index and <b>&lt;tree-ish&gt;</b> (defaults to <b>HEAD</b>). The chosen hunks
  are applied in reverse to the index.
<p class="Pp">This means that <b>git reset -p</b> is the opposite of <b>git add
    -p</b>, i.e. you can use it to selectively reset hunks. See the
    &#x201C;Interactive Mode&#x201D; section of <b>git-add</b>(1) to learn how
    to operate the <b>--patch</b> mode.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>git reset</i> [&lt;mode&gt;] [&lt;commit&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This form resets the current branch head to
  <b>&lt;commit&gt;</b> and possibly updates the index (resetting it to the tree
  of <b>&lt;commit&gt;</b>) and the working tree depending on
  <b>&lt;mode&gt;</b>. If <b>&lt;mode&gt;</b> is omitted, defaults to
  <b>--mixed</b>. The <b>&lt;mode&gt;</b> must be one of the following:
<p class="Pp">--soft</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Does not touch the index file or the working tree at all
  (but resets the head to <b>&lt;commit&gt;</b>, just like all modes do). This
  leaves all your changed files &quot;Changes to be committed&quot;, as <b>git
  status</b> would put it.</div>
<p class="Pp">--mixed</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Resets the index but not the working tree (i.e., the
  changed files are preserved but not marked for commit) and reports what has
  not been updated. This is the default action.
<p class="Pp">If <b>-N</b> is specified, removed paths are marked as
    intent-to-add (see <b>git-add</b>(1)).</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--hard</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Resets the index and working tree. Any changes to tracked
  files in the working tree since <b>&lt;commit&gt;</b> are discarded.</div>
<p class="Pp">--merge</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Resets the index and updates the files in the working
  tree that are different between <b>&lt;commit&gt;</b> and <b>HEAD</b>, but
  keeps those which are different between the index and working tree (i.e. which
  have changes which have not been added). If a file that is different between
  <b>&lt;commit&gt;</b> and the index has unstaged changes, reset is aborted.
<p class="Pp">In other words, <b>--merge</b> does something like a <b>git
    read-tree -u -m &lt;commit&gt;</b>, but carries forward unmerged index
    entries.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--keep</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Resets index entries and updates files in the working
  tree that are different between <b>&lt;commit&gt;</b> and <b>HEAD</b>. If a
  file that is different between <b>&lt;commit&gt;</b> and <b>HEAD</b> has local
  changes, reset is aborted.</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp">See &quot;Reset, restore and revert&quot; in <b>git</b>(1) for the
    differences between the three commands.</p>

  <b>3. </b>However, you already dirtied the index (i.e. your index does not

<div class="Bd-indent">Suppose that you have created lots of logically separate

  better to have each logical chunk associated with its own commit. You can use
  git reset to rewind history without changing the contents of your local files,
  and then successively use <b>git add -p</b> to interactively select which
  hunks to include into each commit, using <b>git commit -c</b> to pre-populate
  the commit message.

</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>1. </b>First, reset the history back one commit so that we
    remove the original commit, but leave the working tree with all the changes.
    The -N ensures that any new files added with <b>HEAD</b> are still marked so
    that <b>git add -p</b> will find them.
  <br/>
  <b>2. </b>Next, we interactively select diff hunks to add using the <b>git add
    -p</b> facility. This will ask you about each diff hunk in sequence and you
    can use simple commands such as &quot;yes, include this&quot;, &quot;No
    don&#x2019;t include this&quot; or even the very powerful &quot;edit&quot;
    facility.
  <br/>
  <b>3. </b>Once satisfied with the hunks you want to include, you should verify
    what has been prepared for the first commit by using <b>git diff
    --cached</b>. This shows all the changes that have been moved into the index
    and are about to be committed.
  <br/>
  <b>4. </b>Next, commit the changes stored in the index. The <b>-c</b> option
    specifies to pre-populate the commit message from the original message that
    you started with in the first commit. This is helpful to avoid retyping it.
    The <b>HEAD@{1}</b> is a special notation for the commit that <b>HEAD</b>
    used to be at prior to the original reset commit (1 change ago). See
    <b>git-reflog</b>(1) for more details. You may also use any other valid
    commit reference.
  <br/>
  <b>5. </b>You can repeat steps 2-4 multiple times to break the original code
    into any number of commits.
  <br/>
  <b>6. </b>Now you&#x2019;ve split out many of the changes into their own
    commits, and might no longer use the patch mode of <b>git add</b>, in order
    to select all remaining uncommitted changes.
  <br/>
  <b>7. </b>Once again, check to verify that you&#x2019;ve included what you
    want to. You may also wish to verify that git diff doesn&#x2019;t show any
    remaining changes to be committed later.
  <br/>
  <b>8. </b>And finally create the final commit.

<p class="Pp"><b>reset --merge</b> is meant to be used when resetting out of a
    conflicted merge. Any mergy operation guarantees that the working tree file
    that is involved in the merge does not have a local change with respect to
    the index before it starts, and that it writes the result out to the working
    tree. So if we see some difference between the index and the target and also
    between the index and the working tree, then it means that we are not
    resetting out from a state that a mergy operation left after failing with a
    conflict. That is why we disallow <b>--merge</b> option in this case.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>reset --keep</b> is meant to be used when removing some of the
    last commits in the current branch while keeping changes in the working
    tree. If there could be conflicts between the changes in the commit we want
    to remove and the changes in the working tree we want to keep, the reset is
    disallowed. That&#x2019;s why it is disallowed if there are both changes
    between the working tree and <b>HEAD</b>, and between <b>HEAD</b> and the
    target. To be safe, it is also disallowed when there are unmerged
  entries.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following tables show what happens when there are unmerged
    entries:</p>
