<p class="Pp">Compiled terminfo descriptions are placed under the directory
    <b>/usr/share/terminfo</b>. Two configurations are supported (when building
    the ncurses libraries):</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="directory"><a class="permalink" href="#directory"><b>directory

  <dd>A two-level scheme is used to avoid a linear search of a huge UNIX system
      directory: <b>/usr/share/terminfo/c/name</b> where <i>name</i> is the name
      of the terminal, and <i>c</i> is the first character of <i>name</i>. Thus,
      <i>act4</i> can be found in the file <b>/usr/share/terminfo/a/act4</b>.
      Synonyms for the same terminal are implemented by multiple links to the
      same compiled file.</dd>
  <dt id="hashed"><a class="permalink" href="#hashed"><b>hashed
    database</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Using Berkeley database, two types of records are stored: the terminfo
      data in the same format as stored in a directory tree with the terminfo's
      primary name as a key, and records containing only aliases pointing to the
      primary name.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>If built to write hashed databases, ncurses can still read terminfo
      databases organized as a directory tree, but cannot write entries into the
      directory tree. It can write (or rewrite) entries in the hashed
    database.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>ncurses distinguishes the two cases in the TERMINFO and TERMINFO_DIRS
      environment variable by assuming a directory tree for entries that
      correspond to an existing directory, and hashed database otherwise.</dd>
</dl>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="STORAGE_FORMAT"><a class="permalink" href="#STORAGE_FORMAT">STORAGE
  FORMAT</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The format has been chosen so that it will be the same on all
    hardware. An 8 or more bit byte is assumed, but no assumptions about byte
    ordering or sign extension are made.</p>
<p class="Pp">The compiled file is created with the <b>tic</b> program, and read
    by the routine <i>setupterm</i>. The file is divided into six parts: the
    header, terminal names, boolean flags, numbers, strings, and string
  table.</p>
<p class="Pp">The header section begins the file. This section contains six
    short integers in the format described below. These integers are</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>(1) the magic number (octal 0432);</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>(2) the size, in bytes, of the names section;</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>(3) the number of bytes in the boolean section;</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>(4) the number of short integers in the numbers section;</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>(5) the number of offsets (short integers) in the strings section;</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>(6) the size, in bytes, of the string table.</dt>
  <dd></dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Short integers are stored in two 8-bit bytes. The first byte
    contains the least significant 8 bits of the value, and the second byte
    contains the most significant 8 bits. (Thus, the value represented is
    256*second+first.) The value -1 is represented by the two bytes 0377, 0377;
    other negative values are illegal. This value generally means that the
    corresponding capability is missing from this terminal. Note that this
    format corresponds to the hardware of the VAX and PDP-11 (that is,
    little-endian machines). Machines where this does not correspond to the
    hardware must read the integers as two bytes and compute the little-endian
    value.</p>
<p class="Pp">The terminal names section comes next. It contains the first line
    of the terminfo description, listing the various names for the terminal,
    separated by the `|' character. The section is terminated with an ASCII NUL
    character.</p>
<p class="Pp">The boolean flags have one byte for each flag. This byte is either
    0 or 1 as the flag is present or absent. The capabilities are in the same
    order as the file &lt;term.h&gt;.</p>
<p class="Pp">Between the boolean section and the number section, a null byte
    will be inserted, if necessary, to ensure that the number section begins on
    an even byte (this is a relic of the PDP-11's word-addressed architecture,
    originally designed in to avoid IOT traps induced by addressing a word on an
    odd byte boundary). All short integers are aligned on a short word
  boundary.</p>
<p class="Pp">The numbers section is similar to the flags section. Each
    capability takes up two bytes, and is stored as a little-endian short
    integer. If the value represented is -1, the capability is taken to be
    missing.</p>
<p class="Pp">The strings section is also similar. Each capability is stored as
    a short integer, in the format above. A value of -1 means the capability is
    missing. Otherwise, the value is taken as an offset from the beginning of
    the string table. Special characters in ^X or \c notation are stored in
    their interpreted form, not the printing representation. Padding information
    $&lt;nn&gt; and parameter information %x are stored intact in uninterpreted
    form.</p>
<p class="Pp">The final section is the string table. It contains all the values
    of string capabilities referenced in the string section. Each string is null
    terminated.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="EXTENDED_STORAGE_FORMAT"><a class="permalink" href="#EXTENDED_STORAGE_FORMAT">EXTENDED
  STORAGE FORMAT</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The previous section describes the conventional terminfo binary
    format. With some minor variations of the offsets (see PORTABILITY), the
    same binary format is used in all modern UNIX systems. Each system uses a
    predefined set of boolean, number or string capabilities.</p>
<p class="Pp">The ncurses libraries and applications support extended terminfo
    binary format, allowing users to define capabilities which are loaded at
    runtime. This extension is made possible by using the fact that the other
    implementations stop reading the terminfo data when they have reached the
    end of the size given in the header. ncurses checks the size, and if it
    exceeds that due to the predefined data, continues to parse according to its
    own scheme.</p>
<p class="Pp">First, it reads the extended header (5 short integers):</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>(1)</dt>
  <dd>count of extended boolean capabilities</dd>
  <dt>(2)</dt>
  <dd>count of extended numeric capabilities</dd>
  <dt>(3)</dt>
  <dd>count of extended string capabilities</dd>
  <dt>(4)</dt>
  <dd>size of the extended string table in bytes.</dd>
  <dt>(5)</dt>
  <dd>last offset of the extended string table in bytes.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Using the counts and sizes, ncurses allocates arrays and reads
    data for the extended capabilities in the same order as the header
    information.</p>
<p class="Pp">The extended string table contains values for string capabilities.
    After the end of these values, it contains the names for each of the
    extended capabilities in order, e.g., booleans, then numbers and finally
    strings.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="PORTABILITY"><a class="permalink" href="#PORTABILITY">PORTABILITY</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Note that it is possible for <i>setupterm</i> to expect a
    different set of capabilities than are actually present in the file. Either
    the database may have been updated since <i>setupterm</i> has been
    recompiled (resulting in extra unrecognized entries in the file) or the
    program may have been recompiled more recently than the database was updated
    (resulting in missing entries). The routine <i>setupterm</i> must be
    prepared for both possibilities - this is why the numbers and sizes are
    included. Also, new capabilities must always be added at the end of the
    lists of boolean, number, and string capabilities.</p>
<p class="Pp">Despite the consistent use of little-endian for numbers and the
    otherwise self-describing format, it is not wise to count on portability of
    binary terminfo entries between commercial UNIX versions. The problem is
    that there are at least three versions of terminfo (under HP-UX, AIX, and
    OSF/1) which diverged from System V terminfo after SVr1, and have added
    extension capabilities to the string table that (in the binary format)
    collide with System V and XSI Curses extensions. See <b>terminfo</b>(5) for
    detailed discussion of terminfo source compatibility issues.</p>
