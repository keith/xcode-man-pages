<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Perl 5.28 introduced an <span class="Li">&quot;index()&quot;</span>
      optimization when comparing to -1 (or indirectly, e.g. &gt;= 0). When this
      optimization was triggered inside a
      <span class="Li">&quot;when&quot;</span> clause it caused a warning
      (&quot;Argument <span class="Li">%s</span> isn't numeric in smart
      match&quot;). This has now been fixed. [GH #16626]
      &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16626&gt;</li>
  <li>Matching of decimal digits in script runs, introduced in Perl 5.28, had a
      bug that led to <span class="Li">&quot;1\N{THAI DIGIT FIVE}&quot;</span>
      matching <span class="Li">&quot;/^(*sr:\d+)$/&quot;</span> when it should
      not. This has now been fixed.</li>

<p class="Pp">Perl 5.28.1 represents approximately 5 months of development since
    Perl 5.28.0 and contains approximately 6,100 lines of changes across 44
    files from 12 authors.</p>
<p class="Pp">Excluding auto-generated files, documentation and release tools,
    there were approximately 700 lines of changes to 12 .pm, .t, .c and .h
    files.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl continues to flourish into its fourth decade thanks to a
    vibrant community of users and developers. The following people are known to
    have contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.28.1:</p>
<p class="Pp">Aaron Crane, Abigail, Chris 'BinGOs' Williams, Dagfinn Ilmari
    Mannsaaker, David Mitchell, James E Keenan, John SJ Anderson, Karen
    Etheridge, Karl Williamson, Sawyer X, Steve Hay, Tony Cook.</p>
<p class="Pp">The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is
    automatically generated from version control history. In particular, it does
    not include the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who
    reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.</p>
<p class="Pp">Many of the changes included in this version originated in the
    CPAN modules included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire CPAN
    community for helping Perl to flourish.</p>
<p class="Pp">For a more complete list of all of Perl's historical contributors,

<p class="Pp">If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the perl bug
    database at &lt;https://rt.perl.org/&gt; . There may also be information at
    &lt;http://www.perl.org/&gt; , the Perl Home Page.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug
    program included with your release. Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny
    but sufficient test case. Your bug report, along with the output of
    <span class="Li">&quot;perl -V&quot;</span>, will be sent off to
    perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make
    it inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then see
    &quot;SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION&quot; in perlsec for
