<p class="Pp">The <a class="Xr">libarchive(3)</a> library reads and writes a
    variety of streaming archive formats. Generally speaking, all of these
    archive formats consist of a series of &#x201C;entries&#x201D;. Each entry
    stores a single file system object, such as a file, directory, or symbolic
    link.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following provides a brief description of each format
    supported by libarchive, with some information about recognized extensions
    or limitations of the current library support. Note that just because a
    format is supported by libarchive does not imply that a program that uses
    libarchive will support that format. Applications that use libarchive
    specify which formats they wish to support, though many programs do use
    libarchive convenience functions to enable all supported formats.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Tar_Formats"><a class="permalink" href="#Tar_Formats">Tar
  Formats</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The <a class="Xr">libarchive(3)</a> library can read most tar
    archives. It can write POSIX-standard &#x201C;ustar&#x201D; and &#x201C;pax
    interchange&#x201D; formats as well as v7 tar format and a subset of the
    legacy GNU tar format.</p>
<p class="Pp">All tar formats store each entry in one or more 512-byte records.
    The first record is used for file metadata, including filename, timestamp,
    and mode information, and the file data is stored in subsequent records.
    Later variants have extended this by either appropriating undefined areas of
    the header record, extending the header to multiple records, or by storing
    special entries that modify the interpretation of subsequent entries.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="gnutar"><a class="permalink" href="#gnutar"><code class="Cm">gnutar</code></a></dt>
  <dd>The <a class="Xr">libarchive(3)</a> library can read most GNU-format tar
      archives. It currently supports the most popular GNU extensions, including
      modern long filename and linkname support, as well as atime and ctime
      data. The libarchive library does not support multi-volume archives, nor
      the old GNU long filename format. It can read GNU sparse file entries,
      including the new POSIX-based formats.
    <p class="Pp">The <a class="Xr">libarchive(3)</a> library can write GNU tar
        format, including long filename and linkname support, as well as atime
        and ctime data.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="pax"><a class="permalink" href="#pax"><code class="Cm">pax</code></a></dt>
  <dd>The <a class="Xr">libarchive(3)</a> library can read and write
      POSIX-compliant pax interchange format archives. Pax interchange format
      archives are an extension of the older ustar format that adds a separate
      entry with additional attributes stored as key/value pairs immediately
      before each regular entry. The presence of these additional entries is the
      only difference between pax interchange format and the older ustar format.
      The extended attributes are of unlimited length and are stored as UTF-8
      Unicode strings. Keywords defined in the standard are in all lowercase;
      vendors are allowed to define custom keys by preceding them with the
      vendor name in all uppercase. When writing pax archives, libarchive uses
      many of the SCHILY keys defined by Joerg Schilling's &#x201C;star&#x201D;
      archiver and a few LIBARCHIVE keys. The libarchive library can read most
      of the SCHILY keys and most of the GNU keys introduced by GNU tar. It
      silently ignores any keywords that it does not understand.
    <p class="Pp">The pax interchange format converts filenames to Unicode and
        stores them using the UTF-8 encoding. Prior to libarchive 3.0,
        libarchive erroneously assumed that the system wide-character routines
        natively supported Unicode. This caused it to mis-handle non-ASCII
        filenames on systems that did not satisfy this assumption.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="restricted"><a class="permalink" href="#restricted"><code class="Cm">restricted
    pax</code></a></dt>
  <dd>The libarchive library can also write pax archives in which it attempts to
      suppress the extended attributes entry whenever possible. The result will
      be identical to a ustar archive unless the extended attributes entry is
      required to store a long file name, long linkname, extended ACL, file
      flags, or if any of the standard ustar data (user name, group name, UID,
      GID, etc) cannot be fully represented in the ustar header. In all cases,
      the result can be dearchived by any program that can read POSIX-compliant
      pax interchange format archives. Programs that correctly read ustar format
      (see below) will also be able to read this format; any extended attributes
      will be extracted as separate files stored in
      <span class="Pa">PaxHeader</span> directories.</dd>
  <dt id="ustar"><a class="permalink" href="#ustar"><code class="Cm">ustar</code></a></dt>
  <dd>The libarchive library can both read and write this format. This format
      has the following limitations:
    <ul class="Bl-bullet Bl-compact">
      <li>Device major and minor numbers are limited to 21 bits. Nodes with
          larger numbers will not be added to the archive.</li>
      <li>Path names in the archive are limited to 255 bytes. (Shorter if there
          is no / character in exactly the right place.)</li>
      <li>Symbolic links and hard links are stored in the archive with the name
          of the referenced file. This name is limited to 100 bytes.</li>
      <li>Extended attributes, file flags, and other extended security
          information cannot be stored.</li>
      <li>Archive entries are limited to 8 gigabytes in size.</li>
    </ul>
    Note that the pax interchange format has none of these restrictions. The
      ustar format is old and widely supported. It is recommended when
      compatibility is the primary concern.</dd>
  <dt id="v7"><a class="permalink" href="#v7"><code class="Cm">v7</code></a></dt>
  <dd>The libarchive library can read and write the legacy v7 tar format. This
      format has the following limitations:
    <ul class="Bl-bullet Bl-compact">
      <li>Only regular files, directories, and symbolic links can be archived.
          Block and character device nodes, FIFOs, and sockets cannot be
          archived.</li>
      <li>Path names in the archive are limited to 100 bytes.</li>
      <li>Symbolic links and hard links are stored in the archive with the name
          of the referenced file. This name is limited to 100 bytes.</li>
      <li>User and group information are stored as numeric IDs; there is no
          provision for storing user or group names.</li>
      <li>Extended attributes, file flags, and other extended security
          information cannot be stored.</li>
      <li>Archive entries are limited to 8 gigabytes in size.</li>
    </ul>
    Generally, users should prefer the ustar format for portability as the v7
      tar format is both less useful and less portable.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The libarchive library also reads a variety of commonly-used
    extensions to the basic tar format. These extensions are recognized
    automatically whenever they appear.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>Numeric extensions.</dt>
  <dd>The POSIX standards require fixed-length numeric fields to be written with
      some character position reserved for terminators. Libarchive allows these
      fields to be written without terminator characters. This extends the
      allowable range; in particular, ustar archives with this extension can
      support entries up to 64 gigabytes in size. Libarchive also recognizes
      base-256 values in most numeric fields. This essentially removes all
      limitations on file size, modification time, and device numbers.</dd>
  <dt>Solaris extensions</dt>
  <dd>Libarchive recognizes ACL and extended attribute records written by
      Solaris tar.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The first tar program appeared in Seventh Edition Unix in 1979.
    The first official standard for the tar file format was the
    &#x201C;ustar&#x201D; (Unix Standard Tar) format defined by POSIX in 1988.
    POSIX.1-2001 extended the ustar format to create the &#x201C;pax
    interchange&#x201D; format.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Cpio_Formats"><a class="permalink" href="#Cpio_Formats">Cpio
  Formats</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The libarchive library can read and write a number of common cpio
    variants. A cpio archive stores each entry as a fixed-size header followed
    by a variable-length filename and variable-length data. Unlike the tar
    format, the cpio format does only minimal padding of the header or file
    data. There are several cpio variants, which differ primarily in how they
    store the initial header: some store the values as octal or hexadecimal
    numbers in ASCII, others as binary values of varying byte order and
  length.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="binary"><a class="permalink" href="#binary"><code class="Cm">binary</code></a></dt>
  <dd>The libarchive library transparently reads both big-endian and
      little-endian variants of the the two binary cpio formats; the original
      one from PWB/UNIX, and the later, more widely used, variant. This format
      used 32-bit binary values for file size and mtime, and 16-bit binary
      values for the other fields. The formats support only the file types
      present in UNIX at the time of their creation. File sizes are limited to
      24 bits in the PWB format, because of the limits of the file system, and
      to 31 bits in the newer binary format, where signed 32 bit longs were
      used.</dd>
  <dt id="odc"><a class="permalink" href="#odc"><code class="Cm">odc</code></a></dt>
  <dd>This is the POSIX standardized format, which is officially known as the
      &#x201C;cpio interchange format&#x201D; or the &#x201C;octet-oriented cpio
      archive format&#x201D; and sometimes unofficially referred to as the
      &#x201C;old character format&#x201D;. This format stores the header
      contents as octal values in ASCII. It is standard, portable, and immune
      from byte-order confusion. File sizes and mtime are limited to 33 bits
      (8GB file size), other fields are limited to 18 bits.</dd>
  <dt id="SVR4/newc"><a class="permalink" href="#SVR4/newc"><code class="Cm">SVR4/newc</code></a></dt>
  <dd>The libarchive library can read both CRC and non-CRC variants of this
      format. The SVR4 format uses eight-digit hexadecimal values for all header
      fields. This limits file size to 4GB, and also limits the mtime and other
      fields to 32 bits. The SVR4 format can optionally include a CRC of the
      file contents, although libarchive does not currently verify this
    CRC.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Cpio first appeared in PWB/UNIX 1.0, which was released within
    AT&amp;T in 1977. PWB/UNIX 1.0 formed the basis of System III Unix, released
    outside of AT&amp;T in 1981. This makes cpio older than tar, although cpio
    was not included in Version 7 AT&amp;T Unix. As a result, the tar command
    became much better known in universities and research groups that used
    Version 7. The combination of the <code class="Nm">find</code> and
    <code class="Nm">cpio</code> utilities provided very precise control over
    file selection. Unfortunately, the format has many limitations that make it
    unsuitable for widespread use. Only the POSIX format permits files over 4GB,
    and its 18-bit limit for most other fields makes it unsuitable for modern
    systems. In addition, cpio formats only store numeric UID/GID values (not
    usernames and group names), which can make it very difficult to correctly
    transfer archives across systems with dissimilar user numbering.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Shar_Formats"><a class="permalink" href="#Shar_Formats">Shar
  Formats</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">A &#x201C;shell archive&#x201D; is a shell script that, when
    executed on a POSIX-compliant system, will recreate a collection of file
    system objects. The libarchive library can write two different kinds of shar
    archives:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="shar"><a class="permalink" href="#shar"><code class="Cm">shar</code></a></dt>
  <dd>The traditional shar format uses a limited set of POSIX commands,
      including <a class="Xr">echo(1)</a>, <a class="Xr">mkdir(1)</a>, and
      <a class="Xr">sed(1)</a>. It is suitable for portably archiving small
      collections of plain text files. However, it is not generally well-suited
      for large archives (many implementations of <a class="Xr">sh(1)</a> have
      limits on the size of a script) nor should it be used with non-text
    files.</dd>
  <dt id="shardump"><a class="permalink" href="#shardump"><code class="Cm">shardump</code></a></dt>
  <dd>This format is similar to shar but encodes files using
      <a class="Xr">uuencode(1)</a> so that the result will be a plain text file
      regardless of the file contents. It also includes additional shell
      commands that attempt to reproduce as many file attributes as possible,
      including owner, mode, and flags. The additional commands used to restore
      file attributes make shardump archives less portable than plain shar
      archives.</dd>
</dl>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="ISO9660_format"><a class="permalink" href="#ISO9660_format">ISO9660
  format</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Libarchive can read and extract from files containing
    ISO9660-compliant CDROM images. In many cases, this can remove the need to
    burn a physical CDROM just in order to read the files contained in an
    ISO9660 image. It also avoids security and complexity issues that come with
    virtual mounts and loopback devices. Libarchive supports the most common
    Rockridge extensions and has partial support for Joliet extensions. If both
    extensions are present, the Joliet extensions will be used and the Rockridge
    extensions will be ignored. In particular, this can create problems with
    hardlinks and symlinks, which are supported by Rockridge but not by
  Joliet.</p>
<p class="Pp">Libarchive reads ISO9660 images using a streaming strategy. This
    allows it to read compressed images directly (decompressing on the fly) and
    allows it to read images directly from network sockets, pipes, and other
    non-seekable data sources. This strategy works well for optimized ISO9660
    images created by many popular programs. Such programs collect all directory
    information at the beginning of the ISO9660 image so it can be read from a
    physical disk with a minimum of seeking. However, not all ISO9660 images can
    be read in this fashion.</p>
<p class="Pp">Libarchive can also write ISO9660 images. Such images are fully
    optimized with the directory information preceding all file data. This is
    done by storing all file data to a temporary file while collecting directory
    information in memory. When the image is finished, libarchive writes out the
    directory structure followed by the file data. The location used for the
    temporary file can be changed by the usual environment variables.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Zip_format"><a class="permalink" href="#Zip_format">Zip
  format</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Libarchive can read and write zip format archives that have
    uncompressed entries and entries compressed with the &#x201C;deflate&#x201D;
    algorithm. Other zip compression algorithms are not supported. It can
    extract jar archives, archives that use Zip64 extensions and self-extracting
    zip archives. Libarchive can use either of two different strategies for
    reading Zip archives: a streaming strategy which is fast and can handle
    extremely large archives, and a seeking strategy which can correctly process
    self-extracting Zip archives and archives with deleted members or other
    in-place modifications.</p>
<p class="Pp">The streaming reader processes Zip archives as they are read. It
    can read archives of arbitrary size from tape or network sockets, and can
    decode Zip archives that have been separately compressed or encoded.
    However, self-extracting Zip archives and archives with certain types of
    modifications cannot be correctly handled. Such archives require that the
    reader first process the Central Directory, which is ordinarily located at
    the end of a Zip archive and is thus inaccessible to the streaming reader.
    If the program using libarchive has enabled seek support, then libarchive
    will use this to processes the central directory first.</p>
<p class="Pp">In particular, the seeking reader must be used to correctly handle
    self-extracting archives. Such archives consist of a program followed by a
    regular Zip archive. The streaming reader cannot parse the initial program
    portion, but the seeking reader starts by reading the Central Directory from
    the end of the archive. Similarly, Zip archives that have been modified
    in-place can have deleted entries or other garbage data that can only be
    accurately detected by first reading the Central Directory.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Archive_(library)_file_format"><a class="permalink" href="#Archive_(library)_file_format">Archive
  (library) file format</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The Unix archive format (commonly created by the
    <a class="Xr">ar(1)</a> archiver) is a general-purpose format which is used
    almost exclusively for object files to be read by the link editor
    <a class="Xr">ld(1)</a>. The ar format has never been standardised. There
    are two common variants: the GNU format derived from SVR4, and the BSD
    format, which first appeared in 4.4BSD. The two differ primarily in their
    handling of filenames longer than 15 characters: the GNU/SVR4 variant writes
    a filename table at the beginning of the archive; the BSD format stores each
    long filename in an extension area adjacent to the entry. Libarchive can
    read both extensions, including archives that may include both types of long
    filenames. Programs using libarchive can write GNU/SVR4 format if they
    provide an entry called <span class="Pa">//</span> containing a filename
    table to be written into the archive before any of the entries. Any entries
    whose names are not in the filename table will be written using BSD-style
    long filenames. This can cause problems for programs such as GNU ld that do
    not support the BSD-style long filenames.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="mtree"><a class="permalink" href="#mtree">mtree</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Libarchive can read and write files in <a class="Xr">mtree(5)</a>
    format. This format is not a true archive format, but rather a textual
    description of a file hierarchy in which each line specifies the name of a
    file and provides specific metadata about that file. Libarchive can read all
    of the keywords supported by both the NetBSD and FreeBSD versions of
    <a class="Xr">mtree(8)</a>, although many of the keywords cannot currently
    be stored in an archive_entry object. When writing, libarchive supports use
    of the <a class="Xr">archive_write_set_options(3)</a> interface to specify
    which keywords should be included in the output. If libarchive was compiled
    with access to suitable cryptographic libraries (such as the OpenSSL
    libraries), it can compute hash entries such as
    <code class="Cm">sha512</code> or <code class="Cm">md5</code> from file data
    being written to the mtree writer.</p>
<p class="Pp">When reading an mtree file, libarchive will locate the
    corresponding files on disk using the <code class="Cm">contents</code>
    keyword if present or the regular filename. If it can locate and open the
    file on disk, it will use that to fill in any metadata that is missing from
    the mtree file and will read the file contents and return those to the
    program using libarchive. If it cannot locate and open the file on disk,
    libarchive will return an error for any attempt to read the entry body.</p>
