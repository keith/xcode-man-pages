<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
This utility is designed to write a Makefile for an extension module from a
  Makefile.PL. It is based on the Makefile.SH model provided by Andy Dougherty
  and the perl5-porters.
<p class="Pp">It splits the task of generating the Makefile into several
    subroutines that can be individually overridden. Each subroutine returns the
    text it wishes to have written to the Makefile.</p>
<p class="Pp">As there are various Make programs with incompatible syntax, which
    use operating system shells, again with incompatible syntax, it is important
    for users of this module to know which flavour of Make a Makefile has been
    written for so they'll use the correct one and won't have to face the
    possibly bewildering errors resulting from using the wrong one.</p>
<p class="Pp">On POSIX systems, that program will likely be GNU Make; on
    Microsoft Windows, it will be either Microsoft NMake, DMake or GNU Make. See
    the section on the &quot;MAKE&quot; parameter for details.</p>
<p class="Pp">ExtUtils::MakeMaker (EUMM) is object oriented. Each directory
    below the current directory that contains a Makefile.PL is treated as a
    separate object. This makes it possible to write an unlimited number of
    Makefiles with a single invocation of <b>WriteMakefile()</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">All inputs to WriteMakefile are Unicode characters, not just
    octets. EUMM seeks to handle all of these correctly. It is currently still
    not possible to portably use Unicode characters in module names, because
    this requires Perl to handle Unicode filenames, which is not yet the case on
    Windows.</p>

The generated Makefile enables the user of the extension to invoke
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  perl Makefile.PL # optionally &quot;perl Makefile.PL verbose&quot;
  make
  make test        # optionally set TEST_VERBOSE=1
  make install     # See below
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The Makefile to be produced may be altered by adding arguments of
    the form <span class="Li">&quot;KEY=VALUE&quot;</span>. E.g.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  perl Makefile.PL INSTALL_BASE=~
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Other interesting targets in the generated Makefile are</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  make config     # to check if the Makefile is up-to-date
  make clean      # delete local temp files (Makefile gets renamed)
  make realclean  # delete derived files (including ./blib)
  make ci         # check in all the files in the MANIFEST file
  make dist       # see below the Distribution Support section
</pre>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="make_test"><a class="permalink" href="#make_test">make
  test</a></h2>
MakeMaker checks for the existence of a file named <i>test.pl</i> in the current
  directory, and if it exists it executes the script with the proper set of perl
  <span class="Li">&quot;-I&quot;</span> options.
<p class="Pp">MakeMaker also checks for any files matching
    glob(&quot;t/*.t&quot;). It will execute all matching files in alphabetical
    order via the Test::Harness module with the
    <span class="Li">&quot;-I&quot;</span> switches set correctly.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can also organize your tests within subdirectories in the
    <i>t/</i> directory. To do so, use the <i>test</i> directive in your
    <i>Makefile.PL</i>. For example, if you had tests in:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    t/foo
    t/foo/bar
</pre>
<p class="Pp">You could tell make to run tests in both of those directories with
    the following directives:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    test =&gt; {TESTS =&gt; 't/*/*.t t/*/*/*.t'}
    test =&gt; {TESTS =&gt; 't/foo/*.t t/foo/bar/*.t'}
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The first will run all test files in all first-level
    subdirectories and all subdirectories they contain. The second will run
    tests in only the <i>t/foo</i> and <i>t/foo/bar</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you'd like to see the raw output of your tests, set the
    <span class="Li">&quot;TEST_VERBOSE&quot;</span> variable to true.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  make test TEST_VERBOSE=1
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If you want to run particular test files, set the
    <span class="Li">&quot;TEST_FILES&quot;</span> variable. It is possible to
    use globbing with this mechanism.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  make test TEST_FILES='t/foobar.t t/dagobah*.t'
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Windows users who are using
    <span class="Li">&quot;nmake&quot;</span> should note that due to a bug in
    <span class="Li">&quot;nmake&quot;</span>, when specifying
    <span class="Li">&quot;TEST_FILES&quot;</span> you must use back-slashes
    instead of forward-slashes.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  nmake test TEST_FILES='t\foobar.t t\dagobah*.t'
</pre>

<h2 class="Ss" id="make_testdb"><a class="permalink" href="#make_testdb">make
  testdb</a></h2>
A useful variation of the above is the target
  <span class="Li">&quot;testdb&quot;</span>. It runs the test under the Perl
  debugger (see perldebug). If the file <i>test.pl</i> exists in the current
  directory, it is used for the test.
<p class="Pp">If you want to debug some other testfile, set the
    <span class="Li">&quot;TEST_FILE&quot;</span> variable thusly:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  make testdb TEST_FILE=t/mytest.t
</pre>
<p class="Pp">By default the debugger is called using
    <span class="Li">&quot;-d&quot;</span> option to perl. If you want to
    specify some other option, set the
    <span class="Li">&quot;TESTDB_SW&quot;</span> variable:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  make testdb TESTDB_SW=-Dx
</pre>

<h2 class="Ss" id="make_install"><a class="permalink" href="#make_install">make
  install</a></h2>
make alone puts all relevant files into directories that are named by the macros
  INST_LIB, INST_ARCHLIB, INST_SCRIPT, INST_MAN1DIR and INST_MAN3DIR. All these
  default to something below ./blib if you are <i>not</i> building below the
  perl source directory. If you <i>are</i> building below the perl source,
  INST_LIB and INST_ARCHLIB default to ../../lib, and INST_SCRIPT is not
  defined.
<p class="Pp">The <i>install</i> target of the generated Makefile copies the
    files found below each of the INST_* directories to their INSTALL*
    counterparts. Which counterparts are chosen depends on the setting of
    INSTALLDIRS according to the following table:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
                                 INSTALLDIRS set to
                           perl        site          vendor

                 PERLPREFIX      SITEPREFIX          VENDORPREFIX
  INST_ARCHLIB   INSTALLARCHLIB  INSTALLSITEARCH     INSTALLVENDORARCH
  INST_LIB       INSTALLPRIVLIB  INSTALLSITELIB      INSTALLVENDORLIB
  INST_BIN       INSTALLBIN      INSTALLSITEBIN      INSTALLVENDORBIN
  INST_SCRIPT    INSTALLSCRIPT   INSTALLSITESCRIPT   INSTALLVENDORSCRIPT
  INST_MAN1DIR   INSTALLMAN1DIR  INSTALLSITEMAN1DIR  INSTALLVENDORMAN1DIR
  INST_MAN3DIR   INSTALLMAN3DIR  INSTALLSITEMAN3DIR  INSTALLVENDORMAN3DIR
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The INSTALL... macros in turn default to their
    <span class="Li">%Config</span> ($Config{installprivlib},
    <span class="Li">$Config</span>{installarchlib}, etc.) counterparts.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can check the values of these variables on your system
  with</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    perl '-V:install.*'
</pre>
<p class="Pp">And to check the sequence in which the library directories are
    searched by perl, run</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    perl -le 'print join $/, @INC'
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Sometimes older versions of the module you're installing live in
    other directories in <span class="Li">@INC</span>. Because Perl loads the
    first version of a module it finds, not the newest, you might accidentally
    get one of these older versions even after installing a brand new version.
    To delete <i>all other</i> <i>versions of the module you're installing</i>
    (not simply older ones) set the <span class="Li">&quot;UNINST&quot;</span>
    variable.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    make install UNINST=1
</pre>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="_s-1INSTALL_BASE_s0"><a class="permalink" href="#_s-1INSTALL_BASE_s0">INSTALL_BASE</a></h2>
INSTALL_BASE can be passed into Makefile.PL to change where your module will be
  installed. INSTALL_BASE is more like what everyone else calls
  &quot;prefix&quot; than PREFIX is.
<p class="Pp">To have everything installed in your home directory, do the
    following.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    # Unix users, INSTALL_BASE=~ works fine
    perl Makefile.PL INSTALL_BASE=/path/to/your/home/dir
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Like PREFIX, it sets several INSTALL* attributes at once. Unlike
    PREFIX it is easy to predict where the module will end up. The installation
    pattern looks like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    INSTALLARCHLIB     INSTALL_BASE/lib/perl5/$Config{archname}
    INSTALLPRIVLIB     INSTALL_BASE/lib/perl5
    INSTALLBIN         INSTALL_BASE/bin
    INSTALLSCRIPT      INSTALL_BASE/bin
    INSTALLMAN1DIR     INSTALL_BASE/man/man1
    INSTALLMAN3DIR     INSTALL_BASE/man/man3
</pre>
<p class="Pp">INSTALL_BASE in MakeMaker and
    <span class="Li">&quot;--install_base&quot;</span> in Module::Build (as of
    0.28) install to the same location. If you want MakeMaker and Module::Build
    to install to the same location simply set INSTALL_BASE and
    <span class="Li">&quot;--install_base&quot;</span> to the same location.</p>
<p class="Pp">INSTALL_BASE was added in 6.31.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="_s-1PREFIX_s0_and__s-1LIB_s0_attribute"><a class="permalink" href="#_s-1PREFIX_s0_and__s-1LIB_s0_attribute">PREFIX
  and LIB attribute</a></h2>
PREFIX and LIB can be used to set several INSTALL* attributes in one go. Here's
  an example for installing into your home directory.
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    # Unix users, PREFIX=~ works fine
    perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/path/to/your/home/dir
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This will install all files in the module under your home
    directory, with man pages and libraries going into an appropriate place
    (usually ~/man and ~/lib). How the exact location is determined is
    complicated and depends on how your Perl was configured. INSTALL_BASE works
    more like what other build systems call &quot;prefix&quot; than PREFIX and
    we recommend you use that instead.</p>
<p class="Pp">Another way to specify many INSTALL directories with a single
    parameter is LIB.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    perl Makefile.PL LIB=~/lib
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This will install the module's architecture-independent files into
    ~/lib, the architecture-dependent files into ~/lib/$archname.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note, that in both cases the tilde expansion is done by MakeMaker,
    not by perl by default, nor by make.</p>
<p class="Pp">Conflicts between parameters LIB, PREFIX and the various INSTALL*
    arguments are resolved so that:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>setting LIB overrides any setting of INSTALLPRIVLIB, INSTALLARCHLIB,
      INSTALLSITELIB, INSTALLSITEARCH (and they are not affected by
    PREFIX);</li>
  <li>without LIB, setting PREFIX replaces the initial
      <span class="Li">$Config{prefix}</span> part of those INSTALL* arguments,
      even if the latter are explicitly set (but are set to still start with
      <span class="Li">$Config{prefix}</span>).</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">If the user has superuser privileges, and is not working on AFS or
    relatives, then the defaults for INSTALLPRIVLIB, INSTALLARCHLIB,
    INSTALLSCRIPT, etc. will be appropriate, and this incantation will be the
    best:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    perl Makefile.PL;
    make;
    make test
    make install
</pre>
<p class="Pp">make install by default writes some documentation of what has been
    done into the file
    <span class="Li">&quot;$(INSTALLARCHLIB)/perllocal.pod&quot;</span>. This
    feature can be bypassed by calling make pure_install.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="_s-1AFS_s0_users"><a class="permalink" href="#_s-1AFS_s0_users">AFS

will have to specify the installation directories as these most probably have
  changed since perl itself has been installed. They will have to do this by
  calling
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    perl Makefile.PL INSTALLSITELIB=/afs/here/today \
        INSTALLSCRIPT=/afs/there/now INSTALLMAN3DIR=/afs/for/manpages

<h2 class="Ss" id="Static_Linking_of_a_new_Perl_Binary"><a class="permalink" href="#Static_Linking_of_a_new_Perl_Binary">Static
  Linking of a new Perl Binary</a></h2>
An extension that is built with the above steps is ready to use on systems
  supporting dynamic loading. On systems that do not support dynamic loading,
  any newly created extension has to be linked together with the available
  resources. MakeMaker supports the linking process by creating appropriate
  targets in the Makefile whenever an extension is built. You can invoke the
  corresponding section of the makefile with
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    make perl
</pre>
<p class="Pp">That produces a new perl binary in the current directory with all
    extensions linked in that can be found in INST_ARCHLIB, SITELIBEXP, and
    PERL_ARCHLIB. To do that, MakeMaker writes a new Makefile, on UNIX, this is
    called <i>Makefile.aperl</i> (may be system dependent). If you want to force
    the creation of a new perl, it is recommended that you delete this
    <i>Makefile.aperl</i>, so the directories are searched through for linkable
    libraries again.</p>
<p class="Pp">The binary can be installed into the directory where perl normally
    resides on your machine with</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    make inst_perl
</pre>
<p class="Pp">To produce a perl binary with a different name than
    <span class="Li">&quot;perl&quot;</span>, either say</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    perl Makefile.PL MAP_TARGET=myperl
    make myperl
    make inst_perl
</pre>
<p class="Pp">or say</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    perl Makefile.PL
    make myperl MAP_TARGET=myperl
    make inst_perl MAP_TARGET=myperl
</pre>
<p class="Pp">In any case you will be prompted with the correct invocation of
    the <span class="Li">&quot;inst_perl&quot;</span> target that installs the
    new binary into INSTALLBIN.</p>
<p class="Pp">make inst_perl by default writes some documentation of what has
    been done into the file
    <span class="Li">&quot;$(INSTALLARCHLIB)/perllocal.pod&quot;</span>. This
    can be bypassed by calling make pure_inst_perl.</p>
<p class="Pp">Warning: the inst_perl: target will most probably overwrite your
    existing perl binary. Use with care!</p>
<p class="Pp">Sometimes you might want to build a statically linked perl
    although your system supports dynamic loading. In this case you may
    explicitly set the linktype with the invocation of the Makefile.PL or
  make:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    perl Makefile.PL LINKTYPE=static    # recommended
</pre>
<p class="Pp">or</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Determination_of_Perl_Library_and_Installation_Locations"><a class="permalink" href="#Determination_of_Perl_Library_and_Installation_Locations">Determination
  of Perl Library and Installation Locations</a></h2>
MakeMaker needs to know, or to guess, where certain things are located.
  Especially INST_LIB and INST_ARCHLIB (where to put the files during the
  <b>make</b>(1) run), PERL_LIB and PERL_ARCHLIB (where to read existing modules
  from), and PERL_INC (header files and
  <span class="Li">&quot;libperl*.*&quot;</span>).
<p class="Pp">Extensions may be built either using the contents of the perl
    source directory tree or from the installed perl library. The recommended
    way is to build extensions after you have run 'make install' on perl itself.
    You can do that in any directory on your hard disk that is not below the
    perl source tree. The support for extensions below the ext directory of the
    perl distribution is only good for the standard extensions that come with
    perl.</p>
<p class="Pp">If an extension is being built below the
    <span class="Li">&quot;ext/&quot;</span> directory of the perl source then
    MakeMaker will set PERL_SRC automatically (e.g.,
    <span class="Li">&quot;../..&quot;</span>). If PERL_SRC is defined and the
    extension is recognized as a standard extension, then other variables
    default to the following:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  PERL_INC     = PERL_SRC
  PERL_LIB     = PERL_SRC/lib
  PERL_ARCHLIB = PERL_SRC/lib
  INST_LIB     = PERL_LIB
  INST_ARCHLIB = PERL_ARCHLIB
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If an extension is being built away from the perl source then
    MakeMaker will leave PERL_SRC undefined and default to using the installed
    copy of the perl library. The other variables default to the following:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  PERL_INC     = $archlibexp/CORE
  PERL_LIB     = $privlibexp
  PERL_ARCHLIB = $archlibexp
  INST_LIB     = ./blib/lib
  INST_ARCHLIB = ./blib/arch
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If perl has not yet been installed then PERL_SRC can be defined on
    the command line as shown in the previous section.</p>

If you don't want to keep the defaults for the INSTALL* macros, MakeMaker helps
  you to minimize the typing needed: the usual relationship between
  INSTALLPRIVLIB and INSTALLARCHLIB is determined by Configure at perl
  compilation time. MakeMaker supports the user who sets INSTALLPRIVLIB. If
  INSTALLPRIVLIB is set, but INSTALLARCHLIB not, then MakeMaker defaults the
  latter to be the same subdirectory of INSTALLPRIVLIB as Configure decided for
  the counterparts in <span class="Li">%Config</span>, otherwise it defaults to
  INSTALLPRIVLIB. The same relationship holds for INSTALLSITELIB and
  INSTALLSITEARCH.
<p class="Pp">MakeMaker gives you much more freedom than needed to configure
    internal variables and get different results. It is worth mentioning that
    <b>make</b>(1) also lets you configure most of the variables that are used
    in the Makefile. But in the majority of situations this will not be
    necessary, and should only be done if the author of a package recommends it
    (or you know what you're doing).</p>

    <p class="Pp">A hash of modules that are needed to build your module but not
        run it.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This will go into the
        <span class="Li">&quot;build_requires&quot;</span> field of your
        <i>META.yml</i> and the <span class="Li">&quot;build&quot;</span> of the
        <span class="Li">&quot;prereqs&quot;</span> field of your

    <p class="Pp">The format is the same as PREREQ_PM.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>C</dt>
  <dd>Ref to array of *.c file names. Initialised from a directory scan and the

      MakeMaker but may be handy in Makefile.PLs.</dd>
  <dt>CCFLAGS</dt>
  <dd>String that will be included in the compiler call command line between the
      arguments INC and OPTIMIZE.</dd>
  <dt>CONFIG</dt>
  <dd>Arrayref. E.g. [qw(archname manext)] defines ARCHNAME &amp; MANEXT from

  <dt>CONFIGURE_REQUIRES</dt>
  <dd>Available in version 6.52 and above.
    <p class="Pp">A hash of modules that are required to run Makefile.PL itself,

  </dd>
  <dt>DEFINE</dt>
  <dd>Something like <span class="Li">&quot;-DHAVE_UNISTD_H&quot;</span></dd>
  <dt>DESTDIR</dt>
  <dd>This is the root directory into which the code will be installed. It
      <i>prepends itself to the normal prefix</i>. For example, if your code
      would normally go into <i>/usr/local/lib/perl</i> you could set
      DESTDIR=~/tmp/ and installation would go into
      <i>~/tmp/usr/local/lib/perl</i>.
    <p class="Pp">This is primarily of use for people who repackage Perl
        modules.</p>
    <p class="Pp">NOTE: Due to the nature of make, it is important that you put
        the trailing slash on your DESTDIR. <i>~/tmp/</i> not <i>~/tmp</i>.</p>

    <p class="Pp">For example, Foo::Bar becomes Foo-Bar.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>DISTVNAME</dt>
  <dd>Your name for distributing the package with the version number included.
      This is used by 'make dist' to name the resulting archive file.
    <p class="Pp">Defaults to DISTNAME-VERSION.</p>
    <p class="Pp">For example, version 1.04 of Foo::Bar becomes
      Foo-Bar-1.04.</p>
    <p class="Pp">On some OS's where . has special meaning VERSION_SYM may be
        used in place of VERSION.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>DLEXT</dt>
  <dd>Specifies the extension of the module's loadable object. For example:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
  DLEXT =&gt; 'unusual_ext', # Default value is $Config{so}
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">NOTE: When using this option to alter the extension of a
        module's loadable object, it is also necessary that the module's pm file
        specifies the same change:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
  local $DynaLoader::dl_dlext = 'unusual_ext';
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>DL_FUNCS</dt>
  <dd>Hashref of symbol names for routines to be made available as universal
      symbols. Each key/value pair consists of the package name and an array of
      routine names in that package. Used only under AIX, OS/2, VMS and Win32 at
      present. The routine names supplied will be expanded in the same way as
      XSUB names are expanded by the <b>XS()</b> macro. Defaults to
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
  {&quot;$(NAME)&quot; =&gt; [&quot;boot_$(NAME)&quot; ] }
    </pre>

    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
  {&quot;RPC&quot; =&gt; [qw( boot_rpcb rpcb_gettime getnetconfigent )],
   &quot;NetconfigPtr&quot; =&gt; [ 'DESTROY'] }

    <p class="Pp">Please see the ExtUtils::Mksymlists documentation for more
        information about the DL_FUNCS, DL_VARS and FUNCLIST attributes.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>DL_VARS</dt>
  <dd>Array of symbol names for variables to be made available as universal
      symbols. Used only under AIX, OS/2, VMS and Win32 at present. Defaults to
      []. (e.g. [ qw(Foo_version Foo_numstreams Foo_tree ) ])</dd>
  <dt>EXCLUDE_EXT</dt>
  <dd>Array of extension names to exclude when doing a static build. This is
      ignored if INCLUDE_EXT is present. Consult INCLUDE_EXT for more details.
      (e.g. [ qw( Socket POSIX ) ] )
    <p class="Pp">This attribute may be most useful when specified as a string
        on the command line: perl Makefile.PL EXCLUDE_EXT='Socket Safe'</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>EXE_FILES</dt>
  <dd>Ref to array of executable files. The files will be copied to the
      INST_SCRIPT directory. Make realclean will delete them from there again.
    <p class="Pp">If your executables start with something like #!perl or
        #!/usr/bin/perl MakeMaker will change this to the path of the perl
        'Makefile.PL' was invoked with so the programs will be sure to run
        properly even if perl is not in /usr/bin/perl.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>FIRST_MAKEFILE</dt>
  <dd>The name of the Makefile to be produced. This is used for the second
      Makefile that will be produced for the MAP_TARGET.
    <p class="Pp">Defaults to 'Makefile' or 'Descrip.MMS' on VMS.</p>
    <p class="Pp">(Note: we couldn't use MAKEFILE because dmake uses this for
        something else).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>FULLPERL</dt>
  <dd>Perl binary able to run this extension, load XS modules, etc...</dd>
  <dt>FULLPERLRUN</dt>
  <dd>Like PERLRUN, except it uses FULLPERL.</dd>
  <dt>FULLPERLRUNINST</dt>
  <dd>Like PERLRUNINST, except it uses FULLPERL.</dd>
  <dt>FUNCLIST</dt>
  <dd>This provides an alternate means to specify function names to be exported
      from the extension. Its value is a reference to an array of function names
      to be exported by the extension. These names are passed through unaltered
      to the linker options file.</dd>
  <dt>H</dt>
  <dd>Ref to array of *.h file names. Similar to C.</dd>
  <dt>IMPORTS</dt>
  <dd>This attribute is used to specify names to be imported into the extension.
      Takes a hash ref.
    <p class="Pp">It is only used on OS/2 and Win32.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>INC</dt>
  <dd>Include file dirs eg: <span class="Li">&quot;-I/usr/5include
      -I/path/to/inc&quot;</span></dd>
  <dt>INCLUDE_EXT</dt>
  <dd>Array of extension names to be included when doing a static build.
      MakeMaker will normally build with all of the installed extensions when
      doing a static build, and that is usually the desired behavior. If
      INCLUDE_EXT is present then MakeMaker will build only with those
      extensions which are explicitly mentioned. (e.g. [ qw( Socket POSIX ) ])
    <p class="Pp">It is not necessary to mention DynaLoader or the current
        extension when filling in INCLUDE_EXT. If the INCLUDE_EXT is mentioned
        but is empty then only DynaLoader and the current extension will be
        included in the build.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This attribute may be most useful when specified as a string
        on the command line: perl Makefile.PL INCLUDE_EXT='POSIX Socket
        Devel::Peek'</p>

  <dt>MAKE</dt>
  <dd>Available in version 6.30_01 and above.
    <p class="Pp">Variant of make you intend to run the generated Makefile with.
        This parameter lets Makefile.PL know what make quirks to account for
        when generating the Makefile.</p>
    <p class="Pp">MakeMaker also honors the MAKE environment variable. This
        parameter takes precedence.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Currently the only significant values are 'dmake' and 'nmake'
        for Windows users, instructing MakeMaker to generate a Makefile in the
        flavour of DMake (&quot;Dennis Vadura's Make&quot;) or Microsoft NMake
        respectively.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Defaults to <span class="Li">$Config</span>{make}, which may
        go looking for a Make program in your environment.</p>
    <p class="Pp">How are you supposed to know what flavour of Make a Makefile
        has been generated for if you didn't specify a value explicitly? Search
        the generated Makefile for the definition of the MAKE variable, which is
        used to recursively invoke the Make utility. That will tell you what
        Make you're supposed to invoke the Makefile with.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>MAKEAPERL</dt>
  <dd>Boolean which tells MakeMaker that it should include the rules to make a
      perl. This is handled automatically as a switch by MakeMaker. The user
      normally does not need it.</dd>
  <dt>MAKEFILE_OLD</dt>
  <dd>When 'make clean' or similar is run, the $(FIRST_MAKEFILE) will be backed
      up at this location.
    <p class="Pp">Defaults to $(FIRST_MAKEFILE).old or $(FIRST_MAKEFILE)_old on
        VMS.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>MAN1PODS</dt>
  <dd>Hashref of pod-containing files. MakeMaker will default this to all
      EXE_FILES files that include POD directives. The files listed here will be
      converted to man pages and installed as was requested at Configure time.
    <p class="Pp">This hash should map POD files (or scripts containing POD) to
        the man file names under the
        <span class="Li">&quot;blib/man1/&quot;</span> directory, as in the
        following example:</p>

    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>MAN3PODS</dt>
  <dd>Hashref that assigns to *.pm and *.pod files the files into which the
      manpages are to be written. MakeMaker parses all *.pod and *.pm files for
      POD directives. Files that contain POD will be the default keys of the
      MAN3PODS hashref. These will then be converted to man pages during
      <span class="Li">&quot;make&quot;</span> and will be installed during
      <span class="Li">&quot;make install&quot;</span>.
    <p class="Pp">Example similar to MAN1PODS.</p>

    <p class="Pp">They differ in how they behave if they have the same key as
        the default metadata. META_ADD will override the default value with its
        own. META_MERGE will merge its value with the default.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Unless you want to override the defaults, prefer META_MERGE so
        as to get the advantage of any future defaults.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Where prereqs are concerned, if META_MERGE is used,
        prerequisites are merged with their counterpart

  <dd>MakeMaker can run programs to generate files for you at build time. By
      default any file named *.PL (except Makefile.PL and Build.PL) in the top
      level directory will be assumed to be a Perl program and run passing its
      own basename in as an argument. This basename is actually a build target,
      and there is an intention, but not a requirement, that the *.PL file make
      the file passed to to as an argument. For example...
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    perl foo.PL foo
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This behavior can be overridden by supplying your own set of
        files to search. PL_FILES accepts a hash ref, the key being the file to
        run and the value is passed in as the first argument when the PL file is
        run.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    PL_FILES =&gt; {'bin/foobar.PL' =&gt; 'bin/foobar'}

    <pre>
    perl bin/foobar.PL bin/foobar1

    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">PL files are normally run <b>after</b> pm_to_blib and include

        pm_to_blib and does not include INST_LIB and INST_ARCH in its
        <span class="Li">@INC</span>. This apparently odd behavior is there for
        backwards compatibility (and it's somewhat DWIM). The argument passed to
        the .PL is set up as a target to build in the Makefile. In other
        sections such as <span class="Li">&quot;postamble&quot;</span> you can
        specify a dependency on the filename/argument that the .PL is supposed
        (or will have, now that that is is a dependency) to generate. Note the
        file to be generated will still be generated and the .PL will still run
        even without an explicit dependency created by you, since the

If you cannot achieve the desired Makefile behaviour by specifying attributes
  you may define private subroutines in the Makefile.PL. Each subroutine returns
  the text it wishes to have written to the Makefile. To override a section of
  the Makefile you can either say:
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
        sub MY::c_o { &quot;new literal text&quot; }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">or you can edit the default by saying something like:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
        package MY; # so that &quot;SUPER&quot; works right
        sub c_o {
            my $inherited = shift-&gt;SUPER::c_o(@_);
            $inherited =~ s/old text/new text/;

<p class="Pp">If you are running experiments with embedding perl as a library

MakeMaker.pm uses the architecture-specific information from Config.pm. In

Long plaguing users of MakeMaker based modules has been the problem of getting
  basic information about the module out of the sources <i>without</i> running
  the <i>Makefile.PL</i> and doing a bunch of messy heuristics on the resulting
  <i>Makefile</i>. Over the years, it has become standard to keep this
  information in one or more CPAN Meta files distributed with each distribution.
<p class="Pp">The original format of CPAN Meta files was YAML and the
    corresponding file was called <i>META.yml</i>. In 2010, version 2 of the
    CPAN::Meta::Spec was released, which mandates JSON format for the metadata
    in order to overcome certain compatibility issues between YAML serializers
    and to avoid breaking older clients unable to handle a new version of the
    spec. The CPAN::Meta library is now standard for accessing old and new-style
    Meta files.</p>
<p class="Pp">If CPAN::Meta is installed, MakeMaker will automatically generate
    <i>META.json</i> and <i>META.yml</i> files for you and add them to your
    <i>MANIFEST</i> as part of the 'distdir' target (and thus the 'dist'
    target). This is intended to seamlessly and rapidly populate CPAN with
    module meta-data. If you wish to shut this feature off, set the
    <span class="Li">&quot;NO_META&quot;</span>
    <span class="Li">&quot;WriteMakefile()&quot;</span> flag to true.</p>
<p class="Pp">At the 2008 QA Hackathon in Oslo, Perl module toolchain
    maintainers agreed to use the CPAN Meta format to communicate
    post-configuration requirements between toolchain components. These files,
    <i>MYMETA.json</i> and <i>MYMETA.yml</i>, are generated when
    <i>Makefile.PL</i> generates a <i>Makefile</i> (if CPAN::Meta is installed).
    Clients like CPAN or CPANPLUS will read these files to see what
    prerequisites must be fulfilled before building or testing the distribution.
    If you wish to shut this feature off, set the
    <span class="Li">&quot;NO_MYMETA&quot;</span>
    <span class="Li">&quot;WriteMakeFile()&quot;</span> flag to true.</p>

If some events detected in <i>Makefile.PL</i> imply that there is no way to
  create the Module, but this is a normal state of things, then you can create a

  build targets. To do so, use
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>

    different means on the current architecture).</p>

  and expressly supported, is 5.8.1. However, patches to repair any breakage on
  5.6 are still being accepted.

Module::Build is a pure-Perl alternative to MakeMaker which does not rely on
  make or any other external utility. It is easier to extend to suit your needs.
<p class="Pp">Module::Install is a wrapper around MakeMaker which adds features
    not normally available.</p>
<p class="Pp">ExtUtils::ModuleMaker and Module::Starter are both modules to help
    you setup your distribution.</p>
<p class="Pp">CPAN::Meta and CPAN::Meta::Spec explain CPAN Meta files in
  detail.</p>
<p class="Pp">File::ShareDir::Install makes it easy to install static, sometimes
    also referred to as 'shared' files. File::ShareDir helps accessing the
    shared files after installation.</p>
<p class="Pp">Dist::Zilla makes it easy for the module author to create
    MakeMaker-based distributions with lots of bells and whistles.</p>
