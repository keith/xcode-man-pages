The <span class="Li">&quot;Error&quot;</span> package provides two interfaces.
  Firstly <span class="Li">&quot;Error&quot;</span> provides a procedural
  interface to exception handling. Secondly
  <span class="Li">&quot;Error&quot;</span> is a base class for
  errors/exceptions that can either be thrown, for subsequent catch, or can
  simply be recorded.
<p class="Pp">Errors in the class <span class="Li">&quot;Error&quot;</span>
    should not be thrown directly, but the user should throw errors from a
    sub-class of <span class="Li">&quot;Error&quot;</span>.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="WARNING"><a class="permalink" href="#WARNING">WARNING</a></h1>
Using the &quot;Error&quot; module is <b>no longer recommended</b> due to the
  black-magical nature of its syntactic sugar, which often tends to break. Its
  maintainers have stopped actively writing code that uses it, and discourage
  people from doing so. See the &quot;SEE ALSO&quot; section below for better
  recommendations.

<span class="Li">&quot;Error&quot;</span> exports subroutines to perform

    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;BLOCK&quot;</span> will be passed two
        arguments. The first will be the error being thrown. The second is a
        reference to a scalar variable. If this variable is set by the catch
        block then, on return from the catch block, try will continue processing
        as if the catch block was never found. The error will also be available

The <span class="Li">&quot;Error&quot;</span> object is implemented as a HASH.
  This HASH is initialized with the arguments that are passed to it's
  constructor. The elements that are used by, or are retrievable by the

  classes may add to these.

This class can be used to hold simple error strings and values. It's constructor
  takes two arguments. The first is a text value, the second is a numeric value.
  These values are what will be returned by the overload methods.
<p class="Pp">If the text value ends with <span class="Li">&quot;at file line

This variable holds a reference to a subroutine that converts errors that are
  plain strings to objects. It is used by Error.pm to convert textual errors to
  objects, and can be overridden by the user.
<p class="Pp">It accepts a single argument which is a hash reference to named
    parameters. Currently the only named parameter passed is
    <span class="Li">'text'</span> which is the text of the error, but others

<span class="Li">&quot;Error&quot;</span> also provides handlers to extend the

  is not caught or otherwise handled. These are not installed by default, but

    when the tag is imported, the old values are stored, and used during the new

  It doesn't provide Error's syntactic sugar of <span class="Li">&quot;try { ...

  may be a good thing or a bad thing based on what you want. (Because Error's
