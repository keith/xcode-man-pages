<b>infocmp</b> can be used to compare a binary <b>terminfo</b> entry with other
  terminfo entries, rewrite a <b>terminfo</b> description to take advantage of
  the <b>use=</b> terminfo field, or print out a <b>terminfo</b> description
  from the binary file (<b>term</b>) in a variety of formats. In all cases, the
  boolean fields will be printed first, followed by the numeric fields, followed
  by the string fields.

If no options are specified and zero or one <i>termnames</i> are specified, the

<b>infocmp</b> compares the <b>terminfo</b> description of the first terminal
  <i>termname</i> with each of the descriptions given by the entries for the
  other terminal's <i>termnames</i>. If a capability is defined for only one of
  the terminals, the value returned will depend on the type of the capability:
  <b>F</b> for boolean variables, <b>-1</b> for integer variables, and
  <b>NULL</b> for string variables.
<p class="Pp">The <b>-d</b> option produces a list of each capability that is
    different between two entries. This option is useful to show the difference
    between two entries, created by different people, for the same or similar
    terminals.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>-c</b> option produces a list of each capability that is
    common between two entries. Capabilities that are not set are ignored. This
    option can be used as a quick check to see if the <b>-u</b> option is worth
    using.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>-n</b> option produces a list of each capability that is in
    neither entry. If no <i>termnames</i> are given, the environment variable
    <b>TERM</b> will be used for both of the <i>termnames</i>. This can be used
    as a quick check to see if anything was left out of a description.</p>

The <b>-I</b>, <b>-L</b>, and <b>-C</b> options will produce a source listing
  for each terminal named.

      form</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p class="Pp">If no <i>termnames</i> are given, the environment variable
    <b>TERM</b> will be used for the terminal name.</p>
<p class="Pp">The source produced by the <b>-C</b> option may be used directly
    as a <b>termcap</b> entry, but not all parameterized strings can be changed
    to the <b>termcap</b> format. <b>infocmp</b> will attempt to convert most of
    the parameterized information, and anything not converted will be plainly
    marked in the output and commented out. These should be edited by hand.</p>
<p class="Pp">All padding information for strings will be collected together and
    placed at the beginning of the string where <b>termcap</b> expects it.
    Mandatory padding (padding information with a trailing '/') will become
    optional.</p>
<p class="Pp">All <b>termcap</b> variables no longer supported by
    <b>terminfo</b>, but which are derivable from other <b>terminfo</b>
    variables, will be output. Not all <b>terminfo</b> capabilities will be
    translated; only those variables which were part of <b>termcap</b> will
    normally be output. Specifying the <b>-r</b> option will take off this
    restriction, allowing all capabilities to be output in <i>termcap</i>
  form.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that because padding is collected to the beginning of the
    capability, not all capabilities are output. Mandatory padding is not
    supported. Because <b>termcap</b> strings are not as flexible, it is not
    always possible to convert a <b>terminfo</b> string capability into an
    equivalent <b>termcap</b> format. A subsequent conversion of the
    <b>termcap</b> file back into <b>terminfo</b> format will not necessarily
    reproduce the original <b>terminfo</b> source.</p>
<p class="Pp">Some common <b>terminfo</b> parameter sequences, their
    <b>termcap</b> equivalents, and some terminal types which commonly have such
    sequences, are:</p>

  Option [-u]</a></h2>
The <b>-u</b> option produces a <b>terminfo</b> source description of the first
  terminal <i>termname</i> which is relative to the sum of the descriptions
  given by the entries for the other terminals <i>termnames</i>. It does this by
  analyzing the differences between the first <i>termname</i> and the other
  <i>termnames</i> and producing a description with <b>use=</b> fields for the
  other terminals. In this manner, it is possible to retrofit generic terminfo
  entries into a terminal's description. Or, if two similar terminals exist, but
  were coded at different times or by different people so that each description
  is a full description, using <b>infocmp</b> will show what can be done to
  change one description to be relative to the other.
<p class="Pp">A capability will get printed with an at-sign (@) if it no longer
    exists in the first <i>termname</i>, but one of the other <i>termname</i>
    entries contains a value for it. A capability's value gets printed if the
    value in the first <i>termname</i> is not found in any of the other
    <i>termname</i> entries, or if the first of the other <i>termname</i>
    entries that has this capability gives a different value for the capability
    than that in the first <i>termname</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The order of the other <i>termname</i> entries is significant.
    Since the terminfo compiler <b>tic</b> does a left-to-right scan of the
    capabilities, specifying two <b>use=</b> entries that contain differing
    entries for the same capabilities will produce different results depending
    on the order that the entries are given in. <b>infocmp</b> will flag any
    such inconsistencies between the other <i>termname</i> entries as they are
    found.</p>
<p class="Pp">Alternatively, specifying a capability <i>after</i> a <b>use=</b>
    entry that contains that capability will cause the second specification to
    be ignored. Using <b>infocmp</b> to recreate a description can be a useful
    check to make sure that everything was specified correctly in the original
    source description.</p>
<p class="Pp">Another error that does not cause incorrect compiled files, but
    will slow down the compilation time, is specifying extra <b>use=</b> fields
    that are superfluous. <b>infocmp</b> will flag any other <i>termname
    use=</i> fields that were not needed.</p>

  Databases [-A <i>directory</i>] [-B <i>directory</i>]</a></h2>
The location of the compiled <b>terminfo</b> database is taken from the
  environment variable <b>TERMINFO</b> . If the variable is not defined, or the
  terminal is not found in that location, the system <b>terminfo</b> database,
  in <b>/usr/share/terminfo</b>, will be used. The options <b>-A</b> and
  <b>-B</b> may be used to override this location. The <b>-A</b> option will set
  <b>TERMINFO</b> for the first <i>termname</i> and the <b>-B</b> option will
  set <b>TERMINFO</b> for the other <i>termnames</i>. With this, it is possible
  to compare descriptions for a terminal with the same name located in two
  different databases. This is useful for comparing descriptions for the same
  terminal created by different people.

      the corresponding terminal entry.
    <p class="Pp">Before ncurses 5.0, the split between the <b>-e</b> and

      file, and entries with more than one match. For entries with exactly one
      match it includes a difference report. Normally, to reduce the volume of

      and certain DEC VT-series private modes (the set of recognized special
      sequences has been selected for completeness over the existing terminfo
      database). Each report line consists of the capability name, followed by a

  <dd>tells <b>infocmp</b> to not post-process the data after parsing the source
      file. This feature helps when comparing the actual contents of two source
      files, since it excludes the inferences that <b>infocmp</b> makes to fill
      in missing data.</dd>
  <dt><b>-V</b></dt>
  <dd>reports the version of ncurses which was used in this program, and

  <dt><b>-v</b> <i>n</i></dt>
  <dd>prints out tracing information on standard error as the program runs.
      Higher values of n induce greater verbosity.</dd>

  <dd>changes the output to <i>width</i> characters.</dd>
  <dt><b>-x</b></dt>
  <dd>print information for user-defined capabilities. These are extensions to
