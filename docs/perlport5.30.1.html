perlport - Writing portable Perl
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
Perl runs on numerous operating systems. While most of them share much in
  common, they also have their own unique features.
<p class="Pp">This document is meant to help you to find out what constitutes
    portable Perl code. That way once you make a decision to write portably, you
    know where the lines are drawn, and you can stay within them.</p>
<p class="Pp">There is a tradeoff between taking full advantage of one
    particular type of computer and taking advantage of a full range of them.
    Naturally, as you broaden your range and become more diverse, the common
    factors drop, and you are left with an increasingly smaller area of common
    ground in which you can operate to accomplish a particular task. Thus, when
    you begin attacking a problem, it is important to consider under which part
    of the tradeoff curve you want to operate. Specifically, you must decide
    whether it is important that the task that you are coding has the full
    generality of being portable, or whether to just get the job done right now.
    This is the hardest choice to be made. The rest is easy, because Perl
    provides many choices, whichever way you want to approach your problem.</p>
<p class="Pp">Looking at it another way, writing portable code is usually about
    willfully limiting your available choices. Naturally, it takes discipline
    and sacrifice to do that. The product of portability and convenience may be
    a constant. You have been warned.</p>
<p class="Pp">Be aware of two important points:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>Not all Perl programs have to be portable</dt>
  <dd>There is no reason you should not use Perl as a language to glue Unix
      tools together, or to prototype a Macintosh application, or to manage the
      Windows registry. If it makes no sense to aim for portability for one
      reason or another in a given program, then don't bother.</dd>
  <dt>Nearly all of Perl already <i>is</i> portable</dt>
  <dd>Don't be fooled into thinking that it is hard to create portable Perl
      code. It isn't. Perl tries its level-best to bridge the gaps between
      what's available on different platforms, and all the means available to
      use those features. Thus almost all Perl code runs on any machine without
      modification. But there are some significant issues in writing portable
      code, and this document is entirely about those issues.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Here's the general rule: When you approach a task commonly done
    using a whole range of platforms, think about writing portable code. That
    way, you don't sacrifice much by way of the implementation choices you can
    avail yourself of, and at the same time you can give your users lots of
    platform choices. On the other hand, when you have to take advantage of some
    unique feature of a particular platform, as is often the case with systems
    programming (whether for Unix, Windows, VMS, etc.), consider writing
    platform-specific code.</p>
<p class="Pp">When the code will run on only two or three operating systems, you
    may need to consider only the differences of those particular systems. The
    important thing is to decide where the code will run and to be deliberate in
    your decision.</p>
<p class="Pp">The material below is separated into three main sections: main
    issues of portability (&quot;ISSUES&quot;), platform-specific issues
    (&quot;PLATFORMS&quot;), and built-in Perl functions that behave differently
    on various ports (&quot;FUNCTION IMPLEMENTATIONS&quot;).</p>
<p class="Pp">This information should not be considered complete; it includes
    possibly transient information about idiosyncrasies of some of the ports,
    almost all of which are in a state of constant evolution. Thus, this
    material should be considered a perpetual work in progress
    (<span class="Li">&quot;&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;yellow_sign.gif&quot;
    ALT=&quot;Under Construction&quot;&gt;&quot;</span>).</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Newlines"><a class="permalink" href="#Newlines">Newlines</a></h2>
In most operating systems, lines in files are terminated by newlines. Just what
  is used as a newline may vary from OS to OS. Unix traditionally uses
  <span class="Li">&quot;\012&quot;</span>, one type of DOSish I/O uses
  <span class="Li">&quot;\015\012&quot;</span>, Mac&#x00A0;OS uses
  <span class="Li">&quot;\015&quot;</span>, and z/OS uses
  <span class="Li">&quot;\025&quot;</span>.
<p class="Pp">Perl uses <span class="Li">&quot;\n&quot;</span> to represent the
    &quot;logical&quot; newline, where what is logical may depend on the
    platform in use. In MacPerl, <span class="Li">&quot;\n&quot;</span> always
    means <span class="Li">&quot;\015&quot;</span>. On EBCDIC platforms,
    <span class="Li">&quot;\n&quot;</span> could be
    <span class="Li">&quot;\025&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;\045&quot;</span>. In DOSish perls,
    <span class="Li">&quot;\n&quot;</span> usually means
    <span class="Li">&quot;\012&quot;</span>, but when accessing a file in
    &quot;text&quot; mode, perl uses the
    <span class="Li">&quot;:crlf&quot;</span> layer that translates it to (or
    from) <span class="Li">&quot;\015\012&quot;</span>, depending on whether
    you're reading or writing. Unix does the same thing on ttys in canonical
    mode. <span class="Li">&quot;\015\012&quot;</span> is commonly referred to
    as CRLF.</p>
<p class="Pp">To trim trailing newlines from text lines use
    <span class="Li">&quot;chomp&quot;</span>. With default settings that
    function looks for a trailing <span class="Li">&quot;\n&quot;</span>
    character and thus trims in a portable way.</p>
<p class="Pp">When dealing with binary files (or text files in binary mode) be
    sure to explicitly set <span class="Li">$/</span> to the appropriate value
    for your file format before using
  <span class="Li">&quot;chomp&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Because of the &quot;text&quot; mode translation, DOSish perls
    have limitations in using <span class="Li">&quot;seek&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;tell&quot;</span> on a file accessed in
    &quot;text&quot; mode. Stick to <span class="Li">&quot;seek&quot;</span>-ing
    to locations you got from <span class="Li">&quot;tell&quot;</span> (and no
    others), and you are usually free to use
    <span class="Li">&quot;seek&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;tell&quot;</span> even in &quot;text&quot; mode.
    Using <span class="Li">&quot;seek&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;tell&quot;</span> or other file operations may be
    non-portable. If you use <span class="Li">&quot;binmode&quot;</span> on a
    file, however, you can usually <span class="Li">&quot;seek&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;tell&quot;</span> with arbitrary values safely.</p>
<p class="Pp">A common misconception in socket programming is that
    <span class="Li">&quot;\n&#x00A0;eq&#x00A0;\012&quot;</span> everywhere.
    When using protocols such as common Internet protocols,
    <span class="Li">&quot;\012&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;\015&quot;</span> are called for specifically, and
    the values of the logical <span class="Li">&quot;\n&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;\r&quot;</span> (carriage return) are not
  reliable.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    print $socket &quot;Hi there, client!\r\n&quot;;      # WRONG
    print $socket &quot;Hi there, client!\015\012&quot;;  # RIGHT
</pre>
<p class="Pp">However, using <span class="Li">&quot;\015\012&quot;</span> (or
    <span class="Li">&quot;\cM\cJ&quot;</span>, or
    <span class="Li">&quot;\x0D\x0A&quot;</span>) can be tedious and unsightly,
    as well as confusing to those maintaining the code. As such, the
    <span class="Li">&quot;Socket&quot;</span> module supplies the Right Thing
    for those who want it.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    use Socket qw(:DEFAULT :crlf);
    print $socket &quot;Hi there, client!$CRLF&quot;      # RIGHT
</pre>
<p class="Pp">When reading from a socket, remember that the default input record
    separator <span class="Li">$/</span> is
    <span class="Li">&quot;\n&quot;</span>, but robust socket code will
    recognize as either <span class="Li">&quot;\012&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;\015\012&quot;</span> as end of line:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    while (&lt;$socket&gt;) {  # NOT ADVISABLE!
        # ...
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Because both CRLF and LF end in LF, the input record separator can
    be set to LF and any CR stripped later. Better to write:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    use Socket qw(:DEFAULT :crlf);
    local($/) = LF;      # not needed if $/ is already \012

    while (&lt;$socket&gt;) {
        s/$CR?$LF/\n/;   # not sure if socket uses LF or CRLF, OK
    #   s/\015?\012/\n/; # same thing
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This example is preferred over the previous one--even for Unix
    platforms--because now any <span class="Li">&quot;\015&quot;</span>'s
    (<span class="Li">&quot;\cM&quot;</span>'s) are stripped out (and there was
    much rejoicing).</p>
<p class="Pp">Similarly, functions that return text data--such as a function
    that fetches a web page--should sometimes translate newlines before
    returning the data, if they've not yet been translated to the local newline
    representation. A single line of code will often suffice:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    $data =~ s/\015?\012/\n/g;
    return $data;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Some of this may be confusing. Here's a handy reference to the
    ASCII CR and LF characters. You can print it out and stick it in your
    wallet.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    LF  eq  \012  eq  \x0A  eq  \cJ  eq  chr(10)  eq  ASCII 10
    CR  eq  \015  eq  \x0D  eq  \cM  eq  chr(13)  eq  ASCII 13

             | Unix | DOS  | Mac  |
        ---------------------------
        \n   |  LF  |  LF  |  CR  |
        \r   |  CR  |  CR  |  LF  |
        \n * |  LF  | CRLF |  CR  |
        \r * |  CR  |  CR  |  LF  |
        ---------------------------
        * text-mode STDIO
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The Unix column assumes that you are not accessing a serial line
    (like a tty) in canonical mode. If you are, then CR on input becomes
    &quot;\n&quot;, and &quot;\n&quot; on output becomes CRLF.</p>
<p class="Pp">These are just the most common definitions of
    <span class="Li">&quot;\n&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;\r&quot;</span> in Perl. There may well be others.
    For example, on an EBCDIC implementation such as z/OS (OS/390) or OS/400
    (using the ILE, the PASE is ASCII-based) the above material is similar to
    &quot;Unix&quot; but the code numbers change:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    LF  eq  \025  eq  \x15  eq  \cU  eq  chr(21)  eq  CP-1047 21
    LF  eq  \045  eq  \x25  eq           chr(37)  eq  CP-0037 37
    CR  eq  \015  eq  \x0D  eq  \cM  eq  chr(13)  eq  CP-1047 13
    CR  eq  \015  eq  \x0D  eq  \cM  eq  chr(13)  eq  CP-0037 13

             | z/OS | OS/400 |
        ----------------------
        \n   |  LF  |  LF    |
        \r   |  CR  |  CR    |
        \n * |  LF  |  LF    |
        \r * |  CR  |  CR    |

<h2 class="Ss" id="Numbers_endianness_and_Width"><a class="permalink" href="#Numbers_endianness_and_Width">Numbers
  endianness and Width</a></h2>
Different CPUs store integers and floating point numbers in different orders
  (called <i>endianness</i>) and widths (32-bit and 64-bit being the most common
  today). This affects your programs when they attempt to transfer numbers in
  binary format from one CPU architecture to another, usually either
  &quot;live&quot; via network connection, or by storing the numbers to
  secondary storage such as a disk file or tape.
<p class="Pp">Conflicting storage orders make an utter mess out of the numbers.
    If a little-endian host (Intel, VAX) stores 0x12345678 (305419896 in
    decimal), a big-endian host (Motorola, Sparc, PA) reads it as 0x78563412
    (2018915346 in decimal). Alpha and MIPS can be either: Digital/Compaq
    used/uses them in little-endian mode; SGI/Cray uses them in big-endian mode.
    To avoid this problem in network (socket) connections use the
    <span class="Li">&quot;pack&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;unpack&quot;</span> formats
    <span class="Li">&quot;n&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;N&quot;</span>, the &quot;network&quot; orders. These
    are guaranteed to be portable.</p>
<p class="Pp">As of Perl 5.10.0, you can also use the
    <span class="Li">&quot;&gt;&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;&quot;</span> modifiers to force big- or
    little-endian byte-order. This is useful if you want to store signed
    integers or 64-bit integers, for example.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can explore the endianness of your platform by unpacking a
    data structure packed in native format such as:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    print unpack(&quot;h*&quot;, pack(&quot;s2&quot;, 1, 2)), &quot;\n&quot;;
    # '10002000' on e.g. Intel x86 or Alpha 21064 in little-endian mode
    # '00100020' on e.g. Motorola 68040
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If you need to distinguish between endian architectures you could
    use either of the variables set like so:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    $is_big_endian   = unpack(&quot;h*&quot;, pack(&quot;s&quot;, 1)) =~ /01/;
    $is_little_endian = unpack(&quot;h*&quot;, pack(&quot;s&quot;, 1)) =~ /^1/;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Differing widths can cause truncation even between platforms of
    equal endianness. The platform of shorter width loses the upper parts of the
    number. There is no good solution for this problem except to avoid
    transferring or storing raw binary numbers.</p>
<p class="Pp">One can circumnavigate both these problems in two ways. Either
    transfer and store numbers always in text format, instead of raw binary, or
    else consider using modules like
    <span class="Li">&quot;Data::Dumper&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;Storable&quot;</span> (included as of Perl 5.8).
    Keeping all data as text significantly simplifies matters.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Files_and_Filesystems"><a class="permalink" href="#Files_and_Filesystems">Files
  and Filesystems</a></h2>
Most platforms these days structure files in a hierarchical fashion. So, it is
  reasonably safe to assume that all platforms support the notion of a
  &quot;path&quot; to uniquely identify a file on the system. How that path is
  really written, though, differs considerably.
<p class="Pp">Although similar, file path specifications differ between Unix,
    Windows, Mac&#x00A0;OS, OS/2, VMS, VOS, RISC&#x00A0;OS, and probably others.
    Unix, for example, is one of the few OSes that has the elegant idea of a
    single root directory.</p>
<p class="Pp">DOS, OS/2, VMS, VOS, and Windows can work similarly to Unix with
    <span class="Li">&quot;/&quot;</span> as path separator, or in their own
    idiosyncratic ways (such as having several root directories and various
    &quot;unrooted&quot; device files such NIL: and LPT:).</p>
<p class="Pp">Mac&#x00A0;OS 9 and earlier used
    <span class="Li">&quot;:&quot;</span> as a path separator instead of
    <span class="Li">&quot;/&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The filesystem may support neither hard links
    (<span class="Li">&quot;link&quot;</span>) nor symbolic links
    (<span class="Li">&quot;symlink&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;readlink&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;lstat&quot;</span>).</p>
<p class="Pp">The filesystem may support neither access timestamp nor change
    timestamp (meaning that about the only portable timestamp is the
    modification timestamp), or one second granularity of any timestamps (e.g.
    the FAT filesystem limits the time granularity to two seconds).</p>
<p class="Pp">The &quot;inode change timestamp&quot; (the
    <span class="Li">&quot;-C&quot;</span> filetest) may really be the
    &quot;creation timestamp&quot; (which it is not in Unix).</p>
<p class="Pp">VOS perl can emulate Unix filenames with
    <span class="Li">&quot;/&quot;</span> as path separator. The native pathname
    characters greater-than, less-than, number-sign, and percent-sign are always
    accepted.</p>
<p class="Pp">RISC&#x00A0;OS perl can emulate Unix filenames with
    <span class="Li">&quot;/&quot;</span> as path separator, or go native and
    use <span class="Li">&quot;.&quot;</span> for path separator and
    <span class="Li">&quot;:&quot;</span> to signal filesystems and disk
  names.</p>
<p class="Pp">Don't assume Unix filesystem access semantics: that read, write,
    and execute are all the permissions there are, and even if they exist, that
    their semantics (for example what do <span class="Li">&quot;r&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;w&quot;</span>, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;x&quot;</span> mean on a directory) are the Unix
    ones. The various Unix/POSIX compatibility layers usually try to make
    interfaces like <span class="Li">&quot;chmod&quot;</span> work, but
    sometimes there simply is no good mapping.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;File::Spec&quot;</span> modules provide
    methods to manipulate path specifications and return the results in native
    format for each platform. This is often unnecessary as Unix-style paths are
    understood by Perl on every supported platform, but if you need to produce
    native paths for a native utility that does not understand Unix syntax, or
    if you are operating on paths or path components in unknown (and thus
    possibly native) syntax, <span class="Li">&quot;File::Spec&quot;</span> is
    your friend. Here are two brief examples:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    use File::Spec::Functions;
    chdir(updir());        # go up one directory

    # Concatenate a path from its components
    my $file = catfile(updir(), 'temp', 'file.txt');
    # on Unix:    '../temp/file.txt'
    # on Win32:   '..\temp\file.txt'
    # on VMS:     '[-.temp]file.txt'
</pre>
<p class="Pp">In general, production code should not have file paths hardcoded.
    Making them user-supplied or read from a configuration file is better,
    keeping in mind that file path syntax varies on different machines.</p>
<p class="Pp">This is especially noticeable in scripts like Makefiles and test
    suites, which often assume <span class="Li">&quot;/&quot;</span> as a path
    separator for subdirectories.</p>
<p class="Pp">Also of use is <span class="Li">&quot;File::Basename&quot;</span>
    from the standard distribution, which splits a pathname into pieces (base
    filename, full path to directory, and file suffix).</p>
<p class="Pp">Even when on a single platform (if you can call Unix a single
    platform), remember not to count on the existence or the contents of
    particular system-specific files or directories, like <i>/etc/passwd</i>,
    <i>/etc/sendmail.conf</i>, <i>/etc/resolv.conf</i>, or even <i>/tmp/</i>.
    For example, <i>/etc/passwd</i> may exist but not contain the encrypted
    passwords, because the system is using some form of enhanced security. Or it
    may not contain all the accounts, because the system is using NIS. If code
    does need to rely on such a file, include a description of the file and its
    format in the code's documentation, then make it easy for the user to
    override the default location of the file.</p>
<p class="Pp">Don't assume a text file will end with a newline. They should, but
    people forget.</p>
<p class="Pp">Do not have two files or directories of the same name with
    different case, like <i>test.pl</i> and <i>Test.pl</i>, as many platforms
    have case-insensitive (or at least case-forgiving) filenames. Also, try not
    to have non-word characters (except for
    <span class="Li">&quot;.&quot;</span>) in the names, and keep them to the
    8.3 convention, for maximum portability, onerous a burden though this may
    appear.</p>
<p class="Pp">Likewise, when using the
    <span class="Li">&quot;AutoSplit&quot;</span> module, try to keep your
    functions to 8.3 naming and case-insensitive conventions; or, at the least,
    make it so the resulting files have a unique (case-insensitively) first 8
    characters.</p>
<p class="Pp">Whitespace in filenames is tolerated on most systems, but not all,
    and even on systems where it might be tolerated, some utilities might become
    confused by such whitespace.</p>
<p class="Pp">Many systems (DOS, VMS ODS-2) cannot have more than one
    <span class="Li">&quot;.&quot;</span> in their filenames.</p>
<p class="Pp">Don't assume <span class="Li">&quot;&gt;&quot;</span> won't be the
    first character of a filename. Always use the three-arg version of
    <span class="Li">&quot;open&quot;</span>:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    open my $fh, '&lt;', $existing_file) or die $!;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Two-arg <span class="Li">&quot;open&quot;</span> is magic and can

  Interaction</a></h2>
Not all platforms provide a command line. These are usually platforms that rely
  primarily on a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for user interaction. A program
  requiring a command line interface might not work everywhere. This is probably
  for the user of the program to deal with, so don't stay up late worrying about
  it.
<p class="Pp">Some platforms can't delete or rename files held open by the
    system, this limitation may also apply to changing filesystem
    metainformation like file permissions or owners. Remember to
    <span class="Li">&quot;close&quot;</span> files when you are done with them.
    Don't <span class="Li">&quot;unlink&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;rename&quot;</span> an open file. Don't
    <span class="Li">&quot;tie&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;open&quot;</span> a file already tied or opened;
    <span class="Li">&quot;untie&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;close&quot;</span> it first.</p>
<p class="Pp">Don't open the same file more than once at a time for writing, as
    some operating systems put mandatory locks on such files.</p>
<p class="Pp">Don't assume that write/modify permission on a directory gives the
    right to add or delete files/directories in that directory. That is
    filesystem specific: in some filesystems you need write/modify permission
    also (or even just) in the file/directory itself. In some filesystems (AFS,
    DFS) the permission to add/delete directory entries is a completely separate
    permission.</p>
<p class="Pp">Don't assume that a single
    <span class="Li">&quot;unlink&quot;</span> completely gets rid of the file:
    some filesystems (most notably the ones in VMS) have versioned filesystems,
    and <span class="Li">&quot;unlink&quot;</span> removes only the most recent
    one (it doesn't remove all the versions because by default the native tools
    on those platforms remove just the most recent version, too). The portable
    idiom to remove all the versions of a file is</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    1 while unlink &quot;file&quot;;

<p class="Pp">This will terminate if the file is undeletable for some reason

    ();&quot;</span>, or, if you really have to, make it conditional on
    <span class="Li">&quot;$^O ne 'VMS'&quot;</span> since in VMS the
    <span class="Li">%ENV</span> table is much more than a per-process key-value
    string table.</p>
<p class="Pp">On VMS, some entries in the <span class="Li">%ENV</span> hash are
    dynamically created when their key is used on a read if they did not
    previously exist. The values for <span class="Li">$ENV{HOME}</span>,
    <span class="Li">$ENV{TERM}</span>, <span class="Li">$ENV{PATH}</span>, and
    <span class="Li">$ENV{USER}</span>, are known to be dynamically generated.
    The specific names that are dynamically generated may vary with the version
    of the C library on VMS, and more may exist than are documented.</p>
<p class="Pp">On VMS by default, changes to the <span class="Li">%ENV</span>
    hash persist after perl exits. Subsequent invocations of perl in the same
    process can inadvertently inherit environment settings that were meant to be
    temporary.</p>
<p class="Pp">Don't count on signals or <span class="Li">%SIG</span> for

<p class="Pp">Don't count on filename globbing. Use

Don't assume that the name used to invoke a command or program with
  <span class="Li">&quot;system&quot;</span> or
  <span class="Li">&quot;exec&quot;</span> can also be used to test for the
  existence of the file that holds the executable code for that command or
  program. First, many systems have &quot;internal&quot; commands that are
  built-in to the shell or OS and while these commands can be invoked, there is
  no corresponding file. Second, some operating systems (e.g., Cygwin, DJGPP,
  OS/2, and VOS) have required suffixes for executable files; these suffixes are
  generally permitted on the command name but are not required. Thus, a command
  like <span class="Li">&quot;perl&quot;</span> might exist in a file named
  <i>perl</i>, <i>perl.exe</i>, or <i>perl.pm</i>, depending on the operating
  system. The variable <span class="Li">$Config{_exe}</span> in the
  <span class="Li">&quot;Config&quot;</span> module holds the executable suffix,
  if any. Third, the VMS port carefully sets up <span class="Li">$^X</span> and
  <span class="Li">$Config{perlpath}</span> so that no further processing is
  required. This is just as well, because the matching regular expression used

<p class="Pp">Commands that launch external processes are generally supported on
    most platforms (though many of them do not support any type of forking). The

    are often named differently on different platforms, may not be available in
    the same location, might accept different arguments, can behave differently,
    and often present their results in a platform-dependent way. Thus, you
    should seldom depend on them to produce consistent results. (Then again, if
    you're calling <span class="Li">&quot;netstat -a&quot;</span>, you probably
    don't expect it to run on both Unix and CP/M.)</p>

    <span class="Li">&quot;Mail::Mailer&quot;</span> and

<p class="Pp">The Unix System V IPC (<span class="Li">&quot;msg*(), sem*(),

XS code can usually be made to work with any platform, but dependent libraries,

  itself might be platform-specific, just as Perl code might be. If the

<p class="Pp">A different type of portability issue arises when writing XS code:
    availability of a C compiler on the end-user's system. C brings with it its

The system's notion of time of day and calendar date is controlled in widely

  control the timezone through that variable. Don't assume anything about the
  three-letter timezone abbreviations (for example that MST would be the

  you need to use timezones, express them in some unambiguous format like the
  exact number of minutes offset from UTC, or the POSIX timezone format.
<p class="Pp">Don't assume that the epoch starts at 00:00:00, January 1, 1970,
    because that is OS- and implementation-specific. It is better to store a
    date in an unambiguous representation. The ISO 8601 standard defines
    YYYY-MM-DD as the date format, or YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS (that's a literal
    &quot;T&quot; separating the date from the time). Please do use the ISO 8601
    instead of making us guess what date 02/03/04 might be. ISO 8601 even sorts
    nicely as-is. A text representation (like &quot;1987-12-18&quot;) can be
    easily converted into an OS-specific value using a module like
    <span class="Li">&quot;Time::Piece&quot;</span> (see &quot;Date

    However, starting in Perl v5.22, regular expression pattern bracketed
    character class ranges specified like
    <span class="Li">&quot;qr/[\N{U+HH}-\N{U+HH}]/&quot;</span> are portable,
    and starting in Perl v5.24, the same ranges are portable in
    <span class="Li">&quot;tr///&quot;</span>. You can portably use symbolic
    character classes like <span class="Li">&quot;[:print:]&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Do not assume that the alphabetic characters are encoded
    contiguously (in the numeric sense). There may be gaps. Special coding in

    <span class="Li">&quot;qr/[A-Z]/&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;qr/[a-z]/&quot;</span>, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;qr/[0-9]/&quot;</span> behave as expected.
    <span class="Li">&quot;tr///&quot;</span> behaves the same for these ranges.
    In patterns, any ranges specified with end points using the
    <span class="Li">&quot;\N{...}&quot;</span> notations ensures character set
    portability, but it is a bug in Perl v5.22 that this isn't true of
    <span class="Li">&quot;tr///&quot;</span>, fixed in v5.24.</p>
<p class="Pp">Do not assume anything about the ordering of the characters. The

If you may assume POSIX (a rather large assumption), you may read more about the

    about the filesystem and paths. Be careful not to depend on a specific
    output style for errors, such as when checking <span class="Li">$!</span>
    after a failed system call. Using <span class="Li">$!</span> for anything
    else than displaying it as output is doubtful (though see the
    <span class="Li">&quot;Errno&quot;</span> module for testing reasonably
    portably for error value). Some platforms expect a certain output format,
    and Perl on those platforms may have been adjusted accordingly. Most
    specifically, don't anchor a regex when testing an error value.</p>

Modules uploaded to CPAN are tested by a variety of volunteers on different
  platforms. These CPAN testers are notified by mail of each new upload, and
  reply to the list with PASS, FAIL, NA (not applicable to this platform), or
  UNKNOWN (unknown), along with any relevant notations.
<p class="Pp">The purpose of the testing is twofold: one, to help developers fix
    any problems in their code that crop up because of lack of testing on other
    platforms; two, to provide users with information about whether a given
    module works on a given platform.</p>

Perl is built with a <span class="Li">$^O</span> variable that indicates the
  operating system it was built on. This was implemented to help speed up code
  that would otherwise have to <span class="Li">&quot;use Config&quot;</span>
  and use the value of <span class="Li">$Config{osname}</span>. Of course, to
  get more detailed information about the system, looking into
  <span class="Li">%Config</span> is certainly recommended.
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">%Config</span> cannot always be trusted, however,
    because it was built at compile time. If perl was built in one place, then
    transferred elsewhere, some values may be wrong. The values may even have
    been edited after the fact.</p>

Perl works on a bewildering variety of Unix and Unix-like platforms (see e.g.
  most of the files in the <i>hints/</i> directory in the source code kit). On
  most of these systems, the value of <span class="Li">$^O</span> (hence
  <span class="Li">$Config{osname}</span>, too) is determined either by
  lowercasing and stripping punctuation from the first field of the string
  returned by typing <span class="Li">&quot;uname -a&quot;</span> (or a similar
  command) at the shell prompt or by testing the file system for the presence of
  uniquely named files such as a kernel or header file. Here, for example, are a
  few of the more popular Unix flavors:

<h2 class="Ss" id="_s-1DOS_s0_and_Derivatives"><a class="permalink" href="#_s-1DOS_s0_and_Derivatives">DOS
  and Derivatives</a></h2>
Perl has long been ported to Intel-style microcomputers running under systems
  like PC-DOS, MS-DOS, OS/2, and most Windows platforms you can bring yourself
  to mention (except for Windows CE, if you count that). Users familiar with
  <i>COMMAND.COM</i> or <i>CMD.EXE</i> style shells should be aware that each of
  these file specifications may have subtle differences:
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    my $filespec0 = &quot;c:/foo/bar/file.txt&quot;;
    my $filespec1 = &quot;c:\\foo\\bar\\file.txt&quot;;
    my $filespec2 = 'c:\foo\bar\file.txt';
    my $filespec3 = 'c:\\foo\\bar\\file.txt';
</pre>
<p class="Pp">System calls accept either <span class="Li">&quot;/&quot;</span>
    or <span class="Li">&quot;\&quot;</span> as the path separator. However,
    many command-line utilities of DOS vintage treat
    <span class="Li">&quot;/&quot;</span> as the option prefix, so may get
    confused by filenames containing <span class="Li">&quot;/&quot;</span>.
    Aside from calling any external programs,
    <span class="Li">&quot;/&quot;</span> will work just fine, and probably
    better, as it is more consistent with popular usage, and avoids the problem
    of remembering what to backwhack and what not to.</p>
<p class="Pp">The DOS FAT filesystem can accommodate only &quot;8.3&quot; style
    filenames. Under the &quot;case-insensitive, but case-preserving&quot; HPFS
    (OS/2) and NTFS (NT) filesystems you may have to be careful about case
    returned with functions like <span class="Li">&quot;readdir&quot;</span> or
    used with functions like <span class="Li">&quot;open&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;opendir&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">DOS also treats several filenames as special, such as <i>AUX</i>,
    <i>PRN</i>, <i>NUL</i>, <i>CON</i>, <i>COM1</i>, <i>LPT1</i>, <i>LPT2</i>,
    etc. Unfortunately, sometimes these filenames won't even work if you include
    an explicit directory prefix. It is best to avoid such filenames, if you
    want your code to be portable to DOS and its derivatives. It's hard to know
    what these all are, unfortunately.</p>
<p class="Pp">Users of these operating systems may also wish to make use of
    scripts such as <i>pl2bat.bat</i> to put wrappers around your scripts.</p>
<p class="Pp">Newline (<span class="Li">&quot;\n&quot;</span>) is translated as
    <span class="Li">&quot;\015\012&quot;</span> by the I/O system when reading
    from and writing to files (see &quot;Newlines&quot;).
    <span class="Li">&quot;binmode($filehandle)&quot;</span> will keep
    <span class="Li">&quot;\n&quot;</span> translated as
    <span class="Li">&quot;\012&quot;</span> for that filehandle.
    <span class="Li">&quot;binmode&quot;</span> should always be used for code
    that deals with binary data. That's assuming you realize in advance that
    your data is in binary. General-purpose programs should often assume nothing
    about their data.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">$^O</span> variable and the
    <span class="Li">$Config{archname}</span> values for various DOSish perls
    are as follows:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>

<p class="Pp">The various MSWin32 Perl's can distinguish the OS they are running
    on via the value of the fifth element of the list returned from
    <span class="Li">&quot;Win32::GetOSVersion()&quot;</span>. For example:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>

        my @os_version_info = Win32::GetOSVersion();

    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">There are also
    <span class="Li">&quot;Win32::IsWinNT()|Win32/Win32::IsWinNT()&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;Win32::IsWin95()|Win32/Win32::IsWin95()&quot;</span>,
    and <span class="Li">&quot;Win32::GetOSName()&quot;</span>; try
    <span class="Li">&quot;perldoc Win32&quot;</span>. The very portable
    <span class="Li">&quot;POSIX::uname()&quot;</span> will work too:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    c:\&gt; perl -MPOSIX -we &quot;print join '|', uname&quot;
    Windows NT|moonru|5.0|Build 2195 (Service Pack 2)|x86
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Errors set by Winsock functions are now put directly into
    <span class="Li">$^E</span>, and the relevant
    <span class="Li">&quot;WSAE*&quot;</span> error codes are now exported from
    the Errno and POSIX modules for testing this against.</p>
<p class="Pp">The previous behavior of putting the errors (converted to
    POSIX-style <span class="Li">&quot;E*&quot;</span> error codes since Perl
    5.20.0) into <span class="Li">$!</span> was buggy due to the non-equivalence
    of like-named Winsock and POSIX error constants, a relationship between
    which has unfortunately been established in one way or another since Perl
    5.8.0.</p>
<p class="Pp">The new behavior provides a much more robust solution for checking
    Winsock errors in portable software without accidentally matching POSIX
    tests that were intended for other OSes and may have different meanings for
    Winsock.</p>
<p class="Pp">The old behavior is currently retained, warts and all, for
    backwards compatibility, but users are encouraged to change any code that
    tests <span class="Li">$!</span> against
    <span class="Li">&quot;E*&quot;</span> constants for Winsock errors to
    instead test <span class="Li">$^E</span> against
    <span class="Li">&quot;WSAE*&quot;</span> constants. After a suitable
    deprecation period, which started with Perl 5.24, the old behavior may be
    removed, leaving <span class="Li">$!</span> unchanged after Winsock function
    calls, to avoid any possible confusion over which error variable to
  check.</p>

Perl on VMS is discussed in perlvms in the Perl distribution.
<p class="Pp">The official name of VMS as of this writing is OpenVMS.</p>
<p class="Pp">Interacting with Perl from the Digital Command Language (DCL)
    shell often requires a different set of quotation marks than Unix shells do.
    For example:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    $ perl -e &quot;print &quot;&quot;Hello, world.\n&quot;&quot;&quot;
    Hello, world.
</pre>
<p class="Pp">There are several ways to wrap your Perl scripts in DCL
    <i>.COM</i> files, if you are so inclined. For example:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    $ write sys$output &quot;Hello from DCL!&quot;
    $ if p1 .eqs. &quot;&quot;
    $ then perl -x 'f$environment(&quot;PROCEDURE&quot;)
    $ else perl -x - 'p1 'p2 'p3 'p4 'p5 'p6 'p7 'p8
    $ deck/dollars=&quot;__END__&quot;
    #!/usr/bin/perl

    print &quot;Hello from Perl!\n&quot;;

    __END__
    $ endif
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Do take care with <span class="Li">&quot;$ ASSIGN/nolog/user
    SYS$COMMAND: SYS$INPUT&quot;</span> if your Perl-in-DCL script expects to do
    things like <span class="Li">&quot;$read = &lt;STDIN&gt;;&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The VMS operating system has two filesystems, designated by their
    on-disk structure (ODS) level: ODS-2 and its successor ODS-5. The initial
    port of Perl to VMS pre-dates ODS-5, but all current testing and development
    assumes ODS-5 and its capabilities, including case preservation, extended
    characters in filespecs, and names up to 8192 bytes long.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl on VMS can accept either VMS- or Unix-style file
    specifications as in either of the following:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    $ perl -ne &quot;print if /perl_setup/i&quot; SYS$LOGIN:LOGIN.COM
    $ perl -ne &quot;print if /perl_setup/i&quot; /sys$login/login.com
</pre>
<p class="Pp">but not a mixture of both as in:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    $ perl -ne &quot;print if /perl_setup/i&quot; sys$login:/login.com
    Can't open sys$login:/login.com: file specification syntax error
</pre>
<p class="Pp">In general, the easiest path to portability is always to specify
    filenames in Unix format unless they will need to be processed by native
    commands or utilities. Because of this latter consideration, the File::Spec
    module by default returns native format specifications regardless of input
    format. This default may be reversed so that filenames are always reported
    in Unix format by specifying the
    <span class="Li">&quot;DECC$FILENAME_UNIX_REPORT&quot;</span> feature
    logical in the environment.</p>
<p class="Pp">The file type, or extension, is always present in a VMS-format
    file specification even if it's zero-length. This means that, by default,
    <span class="Li">&quot;readdir&quot;</span> will return a trailing dot on a
    file with no extension, so where you would see
    <span class="Li">&quot;a&quot;</span> on Unix you'll see
    <span class="Li">&quot;a.&quot;</span> on VMS. However, the trailing dot may
    be suppressed by enabling the
    <span class="Li">&quot;DECC$READDIR_DROPDOTNOTYPE&quot;</span> feature in
    the environment (see the CRTL documentation on feature logical names).</p>
<p class="Pp">What <span class="Li">&quot;\n&quot;</span> represents depends on
    the type of file opened. It usually represents
    <span class="Li">&quot;\012&quot;</span> but it could also be
    <span class="Li">&quot;\015&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;\012&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;\015\012&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;\000&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;\040&quot;</span>, or nothing depending on the file
    organization and record format. The
    <span class="Li">&quot;VMS::Stdio&quot;</span> module provides access to the
    special <span class="Li">&quot;fopen()&quot;</span> requirements of files
    with unusual attributes on VMS.</p>
<p class="Pp">The value of <span class="Li">$^O</span> on OpenVMS is
    &quot;VMS&quot;. To determine the architecture that you are running on refer
    to <span class="Li">$Config{archname}</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">On VMS, perl determines the UTC offset from the
    <span class="Li">&quot;SYS$TIMEZONE_DIFFERENTIAL&quot;</span> logical name.
    Although the VMS epoch began at 17-NOV-1858 00:00:00.00, calls to
    <span class="Li">&quot;localtime&quot;</span> are adjusted to count offsets
    from 01-JAN-1970 00:00:00.00, just like Unix.</p>

Perl on VOS (also known as OpenVOS) is discussed in <i>README.vos</i> in the
  Perl distribution (installed as perlvos). Perl on VOS can accept either VOS-
  or Unix-style file specifications as in either of the following:
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    $ perl -ne &quot;print if /perl_setup/i&quot; &gt;system&gt;notices

<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    $ perl -ne &quot;print if /perl_setup/i&quot; &gt;system/notices
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Even though VOS allows the slash character to appear in object
    names, because the VOS port of Perl interprets it as a pathname delimiting
    character, VOS files, directories, or links whose names contain a slash
    character cannot be processed. Such files must be renamed before they can be
    processed by Perl.</p>
<p class="Pp">Older releases of VOS (prior to OpenVOS Release 17.0) limit file
    names to 32 or fewer characters, prohibit file names from starting with a
    <span class="Li">&quot;-&quot;</span> character, and prohibit file names
    from containing <span class="Li">&quot; &quot;</span> (space) or any
    character from the set
    <span class="Li">&quot;!#%&amp;'()*;&lt;=&gt;?&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Newer releases of VOS (OpenVOS Release 17.0 or later) support a
    feature known as extended names. On these releases, file names can contain
    up to 255 characters, are prohibited from starting with a
    <span class="Li">&quot;-&quot;</span> character, and the set of prohibited
    characters is reduced to <span class="Li">&quot;#%*&lt;&gt;?&quot;</span>.
    There are restrictions involving spaces and apostrophes: these characters
    must not begin or end a name, nor can they immediately precede or follow a
    period. Additionally, a space must not immediately precede another space or
    hyphen. Specifically, the following character combinations are prohibited:
    space-space, space-hyphen, period-space, space-period, period-apostrophe,
    apostrophe-period, leading or trailing space, and leading or trailing
    apostrophe. Although an extended file name is limited to 255 characters, a
    path name is still limited to 256 characters.</p>

v5.22 core Perl runs on z/OS (formerly OS/390). Theoretically it could run on

    services for OS/390&quot; (formerly known as OpenEdition), VM/ESA
    OpenEdition, or the BS200 POSIX-BC system (BS2000 is supported in Perl 5.6
    and greater). See perlos390 for details. Note that for OS/400 there is also
    a port of Perl 5.8.1/5.10.0 or later to the PASE which is ASCII-based (as
    opposed to ILE which is EBCDIC-based), see perlos400.</p>
<p class="Pp">As of R2.5 of USS for OS/390 and Version 2.3 of VM/ESA these Unix
    sub-systems do not support the <span class="Li">&quot;#!&quot;</span>
    shebang trick for script invocation. Hence, on OS/390 and VM/ESA Perl
    scripts can be executed with a header similar to the following simple
    script:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    : # use perl
        eval 'exec /usr/local/bin/perl -S $0 ${1+&quot;$@&quot;}'
            if 0;
    #!/usr/local/bin/perl     # just a comment really

    print &quot;Hello from perl!\n&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">OS/390 will support the <span class="Li">&quot;#!&quot;</span>
    shebang trick in release 2.8 and beyond. Calls to
    <span class="Li">&quot;system&quot;</span> and backticks can use POSIX shell
    syntax on all S/390 systems.</p>
<p class="Pp">On the AS/400, if PERL5 is in your library list, you may need to
    wrap your Perl scripts in a CL procedure to invoke them like so:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    BEGIN
      CALL PGM(PERL5/PERL) PARM('/QOpenSys/hello.pl')
    ENDPGM
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This will invoke the Perl script <i>hello.pl</i> in the root of
    the QOpenSys file system. On the AS/400 calls to
    <span class="Li">&quot;system&quot;</span> or backticks must use CL
  syntax.</p>
<p class="Pp">On these platforms, bear in mind that the EBCDIC character set may
    have an effect on what happens with some Perl functions (such as
    <span class="Li">&quot;chr&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;pack&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;print&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;printf&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;ord&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;sort&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;sprintf&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;unpack&quot;</span>), as well as bit-fiddling with
    ASCII constants using operators like <span class="Li">&quot;^&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;&amp;&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;|&quot;</span>, not to mention dealing with socket
    interfaces to ASCII computers (see &quot;Newlines&quot;).</p>
<p class="Pp">Fortunately, most web servers for the mainframe will correctly
    translate the <span class="Li">&quot;\n&quot;</span> in the following
    statement to its ASCII equivalent (<span class="Li">&quot;\r&quot;</span> is
    the same under both Unix and z/OS):</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    print &quot;Content-type: text/html\r\n\r\n&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The values of <span class="Li">$^O</span> on some of these
    platforms include:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    uname         $^O        $Config{archname}

</pre>
<p class="Pp">Some simple tricks for determining if you are running on an EBCDIC
    platform could include any of the following (perhaps all):</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    if (&quot;\t&quot; eq &quot;\005&quot;)  { print &quot;EBCDIC may be spoken here!\n&quot;; }

    if (ord('A') == 193) { print &quot;EBCDIC may be spoken here!\n&quot;; }

    if (chr(169) eq 'z') { print &quot;EBCDIC may be spoken here!\n&quot;; }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">One thing you may not want to rely on is the EBCDIC encoding of
    punctuation characters since these may differ from code page to code page
    (and once your module or script is rumoured to work with EBCDIC, folks will
    want it to work with all EBCDIC character sets).</p>

  RISC OS</a></h2>
Because Acorns use ASCII with newlines (<span class="Li">&quot;\n&quot;</span>)
  in text files as <span class="Li">&quot;\012&quot;</span> like Unix, and
  because Unix filename emulation is turned on by default, most simple scripts
  will probably work &quot;out of the box&quot;. The native filesystem is
  modular, and individual filesystems are free to be case-sensitive or
  insensitive, and are usually case-preserving. Some native filesystems have
  name length limits, which file and directory names are silently truncated to
  fit. Scripts should be aware that the standard filesystem currently has a name
  length limit of <b>10</b> characters, with up to 77 items in a directory, but
  other filesystems may not impose such limitations.
<p class="Pp">Native filenames are of the form</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    Filesystem#Special_Field::DiskName.$.Directory.Directory.File
</pre>
<p class="Pp">where</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    Special_Field is not usually present, but may contain . and $ .
    Filesystem =~ m|[A-Za-z0-9_]|
    DsicName   =~ m|[A-Za-z0-9_/]|
    $ represents the root directory
    . is the path separator
    @ is the current directory (per filesystem but machine global)
    ^ is the parent directory
    Directory and File =~ m|[^\0- &quot;\.\$\%\&amp;:\@\\^\|\177]+|
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The default filename translation is roughly
    <span class="Li">&quot;tr|/.|./|&quot;</span>, swapping dots and
  slashes.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that <span class="Li">&quot;&quot;ADFS::HardDisk.$.File&quot;
    ne 'ADFS::HardDisk.$.File'&quot;</span> and that the second stage of
    <span class="Li">&quot;$&quot;</span> interpolation in regular expressions
    will fall foul of the <span class="Li">$.</span> variable if scripts are not
    careful.</p>
<p class="Pp">Logical paths specified by system variables containing
    comma-separated search lists are also allowed; hence
    <span class="Li">&quot;System:Modules&quot;</span> is a valid filename, and
    the filesystem will prefix <span class="Li">&quot;Modules&quot;</span> with
    each section of <span class="Li">&quot;System$Path&quot;</span> until a name
    is made that points to an object on disk. Writing to a new file
    <span class="Li">&quot;System:Modules&quot;</span> would be allowed only if
    <span class="Li">&quot;System$Path&quot;</span> contains a single item list.
    The filesystem will also expand system variables in filenames if enclosed in
    angle brackets, so
    <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;System$Dir&gt;.Modules&quot;</span> would look
    for the file
    <span class="Li">&quot;$ENV{'System$Dir'}&#x00A0;.&#x00A0;'Modules'&quot;</span>.
    The obvious implication of this is that <b>fully qualified filenames can
    start with </b><b>&quot;&lt;&gt;&quot;</b><b></b> and the three-argument
    form of <span class="Li">&quot;open&quot;</span> should always be used.</p>
<p class="Pp">Because <span class="Li">&quot;.&quot;</span> was in use as a
    directory separator and filenames could not be assumed to be unique after 10
    characters, Acorn implemented the C compiler to strip the trailing
    <span class="Li">&quot;.c&quot;</span>
    <span class="Li">&quot;.h&quot;</span>
    <span class="Li">&quot;.s&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;.o&quot;</span> suffix from filenames specified in
    source code and store the respective files in subdirectories named after the
    suffix. Hence files are translated:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    foo.h           h.foo
    C:foo.h         C:h.foo        (logical path variable)
    sys/os.h        sys.h.os       (C compiler groks Unix-speak)
    10charname.c    c.10charname
    10charname.o    o.10charname
    11charname_.c   c.11charname   (assuming filesystem truncates at 10)
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The Unix emulation library's translation of filenames to native
    assumes that this sort of translation is required, and it allows a
    user-defined list of known suffixes that it will transpose in this fashion.
    This may seem transparent, but consider that with these rules
    <i>foo/bar/baz.h</i> and <i>foo/bar/h/baz</i> both map to
    <i>foo.bar.h.baz</i>, and that <span class="Li">&quot;readdir&quot;</span>
    and <span class="Li">&quot;glob&quot;</span> cannot and do not attempt to
    emulate the reverse mapping. Other <span class="Li">&quot;.&quot;</span>'s
    in filenames are translated to <span class="Li">&quot;/&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">As implied above, the environment accessed through
    <span class="Li">%ENV</span> is global, and the convention is that program
    specific environment variables are of the form
    <span class="Li">&quot;Program$Name&quot;</span>. Each filesystem maintains
    a current directory, and the current filesystem's current directory is the
    <b>global</b> current directory. Consequently, sociable programs don't
    change the current directory but rely on full pathnames, and programs (and
    Makefiles) cannot assume that they can spawn a child process which can
    change the current directory without affecting its parent (and everyone else
    for that matter).</p>
<p class="Pp">Because native operating system filehandles are global and are
    currently allocated down from 255, with 0 being a reserved value, the Unix
    emulation library emulates Unix filehandles. Consequently, you can't rely on
    passing <span class="Li">&quot;STDIN&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;STDOUT&quot;</span>, or
    <span class="Li">&quot;STDERR&quot;</span> to your children.</p>
<p class="Pp">The desire of users to express filenames of the form
    <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;Foo$Dir&gt;.Bar&quot;</span> on the command line
    unquoted causes problems, too: <span class="Li">&quot;``&quot;</span>
    command output capture has to perform a guessing game. It assumes that a
    string <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;[^&lt;&gt;]+\$[^&lt;&gt;]&gt;&quot;</span>
    is a reference to an environment variable, whereas anything else involving
    <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;&gt;&quot;</span> is redirection, and generally
    manages to be 99% right. Of course, the problem remains that scripts cannot
    rely on any Unix tools being available, or that any tools found have
    Unix-like command line arguments.</p>
<p class="Pp">Extensions and XS are, in theory, buildable by anyone using free
    tools. In practice, many don't, as users of the Acorn platform are used to
    binary distributions. MakeMaker does run, but no available make currently
    copes with MakeMaker's makefiles; even if and when this should be fixed, the
    lack of a Unix-like shell will cause problems with makefile rules,
    especially lines of the form <span class="Li">&quot;cd sdbm &amp;&amp; make
    all&quot;</span>, and anything using quoting.</p>
<p class="Pp">&quot;RISC&#x00A0;OS&quot; is the proper name for the operating
    system, but the value in <span class="Li">$^O</span> is &quot;riscos&quot;
    (because we don't like shouting).</p>

Perl has been ported to many platforms that do not fit into any of the

  binaries, for the likes of: aos, Atari ST, lynxos, riscos, Novell Netware,
  Tandem Guardian, <i>etc.</i> (Yes, we know that some of these OSes may fall

      (<span class="Li">44</span>). This behavior may be overridden with the
      pragma <span class="Li">&quot;use vmsish 'exit'&quot;</span>. As with the
      CRTL's <span class="Li">&quot;exit()&quot;</span> function,
      <span class="Li">&quot;exit 0&quot;</span> is also mapped to an exit
      status of <span class="Li">&quot;SS$_NORMAL&quot;</span>
      (<span class="Li">1</span>); this mapping cannot be overridden. Any other
      argument to <span class="Li">&quot;exit&quot;</span> is used directly as
      Perl's exit status. On VMS, unless the future POSIX_EXIT mode is enabled,
      the exit code should always be a valid VMS exit code and not a generic
      number. When the POSIX_EXIT mode is enabled, a generic number will be
      encoded in a method compatible with the C library _POSIX_EXIT macro so
      that it can be decoded by other programs, particularly ones written in C,
      like the GNV package.
    <p class="Pp">(Solaris) <span class="Li">&quot;exit&quot;</span> resets file
        pointers, which is a problem when called from a child process (created
        by <span class="Li">&quot;fork&quot;</span>) in
        <span class="Li">&quot;BEGIN&quot;</span>. A workaround is to use
        <span class="Li">&quot;POSIX::_exit&quot;</span>.</p>

  <dd>Perl now builds with FreeMiNT/Atari. It fails a few tests, that needs some

    <p class="Pp">The FreeMiNT port uses GNU dld for loadable module
        capabilities. So ensure you have that library installed when building

<p class="Pp">The following platforms worked with the previous releases (5.6 and
    5.7), but we did not manage either to fix or to test these in time for the
    5.8.0 release. There is a very good chance that many of these will work fine
    with the 5.8.0.</p>

<p class="Pp">The following platforms have been known to build Perl from source
    in the past (5.005_03 and earlier), but we haven't been able to verify their
    status for the current release, either because the hardware/software
    platforms are rare or because we don't have an active champion on these
    platforms--or both. They used to work, though, so go ahead and try compiling
    them, and let &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues&gt; know of any
    trouble.</p>
