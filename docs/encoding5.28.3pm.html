This pragma is used to enable a Perl script to be written in encodings that
  aren't strictly ASCII nor UTF-8. It translates all or portions of the Perl
  program script from a given encoding into UTF-8, and changes the PerlIO layers
  of <span class="Li">&quot;STDIN&quot;</span> and
  <span class="Li">&quot;STDOUT&quot;</span> to the encoding specified.
<p class="Pp">This pragma dates from the days when UTF-8-enabled editors were
    uncommon. But that was long ago, and the need for it is greatly diminished.
    That, coupled with the fact that it doesn't work with threads, along with
    other problems, (see &quot;BUGS&quot;) have led to its being deprecated. It
    is planned to remove this pragma in a future Perl version. New code should
    be written in UTF-8, and the <span class="Li">&quot;use utf8&quot;</span>
    pragma used instead (see perluniintro and utf8 for details). Old code should
    be converted to UTF-8, via something like the recipe in the
    &quot;SYNOPSIS&quot; (though this simple approach may require manual
    adjustments afterwards).</p>
<p class="Pp">If UTF-8 is not an option, it is recommended that one use a simple
    source filter, such as that provided by Filter::Encoding on CPAN or this
    pragma's own <span class="Li">&quot;Filter&quot;</span> option (see
  below).</p>
<p class="Pp">The only legitimate use of this pragma is almost certainly just
    one per file, near the top, with file scope, as the file is likely going to
    only be written in one encoding. Further restrictions apply in Perls before
    v5.22 (see &quot;Prior to Perl v5.22&quot;).</p>
<p class="Pp">There are two basic modes of operation (plus turning if off):</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>&quot;use encoding ['<i>ENCNAME</i>'] ;&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Please note: This mode of operation is no longer supported as of Perl
      v5.26.
    <p class="Pp">This is the normal operation. It translates various literals
        encountered in the Perl source file from the encoding <i>ENCNAME</i>
        into UTF-8, and similarly converts character code points. This is used
        when the script is a combination of ASCII (for the variable names and
        punctuation, <i>etc</i>), but the literal data is in the specified
        encoding.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><i>ENCNAME</i> is optional. If omitted, the encoding specified
        in the environment variable
        <span class="Li">&quot;PERL_ENCODING&quot;</span> is used. If this isn't
        set, or the resolved-to encoding is not known to
        <span class="Li">&quot;Encode&quot;</span>, the error
        <span class="Li">&quot;Unknown encoding
        '</span><i>ENCNAME</i><span class="Li">'&quot;</span> will be
      thrown.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Starting in Perl v5.8.6
        (<span class="Li">&quot;Encode&quot;</span> version 2.0.1),
        <i>ENCNAME</i> may be the name
        <span class="Li">&quot;:locale&quot;</span>. This is for very
        specialized applications, and is documented in &quot;The
        <span class="Li">&quot;:locale&quot;</span> sub-pragma&quot; below.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The literals that are converted are
        <span class="Li">&quot;q//, qq//, qr//, qw///, qx//&quot;</span>, and
        starting in v5.8.1, <span class="Li">&quot;tr///&quot;</span>.
        Operations that do conversions include
        <span class="Li">&quot;chr&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;ord&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;utf8::upgrade&quot;</span> (but not
        <span class="Li">&quot;utf8::downgrade&quot;</span>), and
        <span class="Li">&quot;chomp&quot;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Also starting in v5.8.1, the
        <span class="Li">&quot;DATA&quot;</span> pseudo-filehandle is translated
        from the encoding into UTF-8.</p>
    <p class="Pp">For example, you can write code in EUC-JP as follows:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
  my $Rakuda = &quot;\xF1\xD1\xF1\xCC&quot;; # Camel in Kanji
               #&lt;-char-&gt;&lt;-char-&gt;   # 4 octets
  s/\bCamel\b/$Rakuda/;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">And with <span class="Li">&quot;use encoding
        &quot;euc-jp&quot;&quot;</span> in effect, it is the same thing as that
        code in UTF-8:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
  my $Rakuda = &quot;\x{99F1}\x{99DD}&quot;; # two Unicode Characters
  s/\bCamel\b/$Rakuda/;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">See &quot;EXAMPLE&quot; below for a more complete example.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Unless <span class="Li">&quot;${^UNICODE}&quot;</span>
        (available starting in v5.8.2) exists and is non-zero, the PerlIO layers
        of <span class="Li">&quot;STDIN&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;STDOUT&quot;</span> are set to
        &quot;<span class="Li">&quot;:encoding(</span><i>ENCNAME</i><span class="Li">)&quot;</span>&quot;.
        Therefore,</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
  use encoding &quot;euc-jp&quot;;
  my $message = &quot;Camel is the symbol of perl.\n&quot;;
  my $Rakuda = &quot;\xF1\xD1\xF1\xCC&quot;; # Camel in Kanji
  $message =~ s/\bCamel\b/$Rakuda/;
  print $message;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">will print</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
 &quot;\xF1\xD1\xF1\xCC is the symbol of perl.\n&quot;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">not</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
 &quot;\x{99F1}\x{99DD} is the symbol of perl.\n&quot;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">You can override this by giving extra arguments; see
      below.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that <span class="Li">&quot;STDERR&quot;</span> WILL NOT
        be changed, regardless.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Also note that non-STD file handles remain unaffected. Use
        <span class="Li">&quot;use</span> <span class="Li">open&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;binmode&quot;</span> to change the layers of
        those.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>&quot;use encoding <i>ENCNAME</i>, Filter=&gt;1;&quot;</dt>
  <dd>This operates as above, but the <span class="Li">&quot;Filter&quot;</span>
      argument with a non-zero value causes the entire script, and not just
      literals, to be translated from the encoding into UTF-8. This allows
      identifiers in the source to be in that encoding as well. (Problems may
      occur if the encoding is not a superset of ASCII; imagine all your
      semi-colons being translated into something different.) One can use this
      form to make
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
 ${&quot;\x{4eba}&quot;}++
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">work. (This is equivalent to
        <span class="Li">&quot;$</span><i>human</i><span class="Li">++&quot;</span>,
        where <i>human</i> is a single Han ideograph).</p>
    <p class="Pp">This effectively means that your source code behaves as if it
        were written in UTF-8 with <span class="Li">&quot;'use
        utf8&quot;</span>' in effect. So even if your editor only supports
        Shift_JIS, for example, you can still try examples in Chapter 15 of
        <span class="Li">&quot;Programming Perl, 3rd Ed.&quot;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This option is significantly slower than the other one.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>&quot;no encoding;&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Unsets the script encoding. The layers of
      <span class="Li">&quot;STDIN&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;STDOUT&quot;</span> are reset to
      &quot;<span class="Li">&quot;:raw&quot;</span>&quot; (the default
      unprocessed raw stream of bytes).</dd>

  &quot;:locale&quot; sub-pragma</a></h2>
Starting in v5.8.6, the encoding name may be
  <span class="Li">&quot;:locale&quot;</span>. This means that the encoding is
  taken from the current locale, and not hard-coded by the pragma. Since a
  script really can only be encoded in exactly one encoding, this option is
  dangerous. It makes sense only if the script itself is written in ASCII, and
  all the possible locales that will be in use when the script is executed are
  supersets of ASCII. That means that the script itself doesn't get changed, but
  the I/O handles have the specified encoding added, and the operations like
  <span class="Li">&quot;chr&quot;</span> and
  <span class="Li">&quot;ord&quot;</span> use that encoding.
<p class="Pp">The logic of finding which locale
    <span class="Li">&quot;:locale&quot;</span> uses is as follows:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>1.</dt>
  <dd>If the platform supports the
      <span class="Li">&quot;langinfo(CODESET)&quot;</span> interface, the
      codeset returned is used as the default encoding for the open pragma.</dd>
  <dt>2.</dt>
  <dd>If 1. didn't work but we are under the locale pragma, the environment
      variables <span class="Li">&quot;LC_ALL&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;LANG&quot;</span> (in that order) are matched for
      encodings (the part after
      &quot;<span class="Li">&quot;.&quot;</span>&quot;, if any), and if any
      found, that is used as the default encoding for the open pragma.</dd>
  <dt>3.</dt>
  <dd>If 1. and 2. didn't work, the environment variables
      <span class="Li">&quot;LC_ALL&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;LANG&quot;</span> (in that order) are matched for
      anything looking like UTF-8, and if any found,
      <span class="Li">&quot;:utf8&quot;</span> is used as the default encoding
      for the open pragma.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">If your locale environment variables
    (<span class="Li">&quot;LC_ALL&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;LC_CTYPE&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;LANG&quot;</span>) contain the strings 'UTF-8' or
    'UTF8' (case-insensitive matching), the default encoding of your
    <span class="Li">&quot;STDIN&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;STDOUT&quot;</span>, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;STDERR&quot;</span>, and of <b>any subsequent file

  <li>If the <span class="Li">&quot;encoding&quot;</span> pragma is in scope
      then the lengths returned are calculated from the length of
      <span class="Li">$/</span> in Unicode characters, which is not always the
      same as the length of <span class="Li">$/</span> in the native
    encoding.</li>
  <li>Without this pragma, if strings operating under byte semantics and strings
      with Unicode character data are concatenated, the new string will be
      created by decoding the byte strings as <i>ISO 8859-1 (Latin-1)</i>.
    <p class="Pp">The <b>encoding</b> pragma changes this to use the specified
        encoding instead. For example:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    use encoding 'utf8';
    my $string = chr(20000); # a Unicode string
    utf8::encode($string);   # now it's a UTF-8 encoded byte string

    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Will print <span class="Li">2</span>, because
        <span class="Li">$string</span> is upgraded as UTF-8. Without
        <span class="Li">&quot;use encoding 'utf8';&quot;</span>, it will print

Notice that only literals (string or regular expression) having only legacy code

<p class="Pp">since the <span class="Li">&quot;\xDF&quot;</span> (ISO 8859-7

    IOTA WITH TONOS) because of the <span class="Li">&quot;\x{100}&quot;</span>
    on the left. You should not be mixing your legacy data and Unicode in the
    same string.</p>
<p class="Pp">This pragma also affects encoding of the 0x80..0xFF code point
    range: normally characters in that range are left as eight-bit bytes (unless
    they are combined with characters with code points 0x100 or larger, in which
    case all characters need to become UTF-8 encoded), but if the
    <span class="Li">&quot;encoding&quot;</span> pragma is present, even the
    0x80..0xFF range always gets UTF-8 encoded.</p>
<p class="Pp">After all, the best thing about this pragma is that you don't have
    to resort to \x{....} just to spell your name in a native encoding. So feel
    free to put your strings in your encoding in quotes and regexes.</p>

The pragma was a per script, not a per block lexical. Only the last
  <span class="Li">&quot;use encoding&quot;</span> or <span class="Li">&quot;no
  encoding&quot;</span> mattered, and it affected <b>the whole script</b>.
  However, the <span class="Li">&quot;no encoding&quot;</span> pragma was
  supported and <span class="Li">&quot;use encoding&quot;</span> could appear as
  many times as you want in a given script (though only the last was effective).
<p class="Pp">Since the scope wasn't lexical, other modules' use of
    <span class="Li">&quot;chr&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;ord&quot;</span>, <i>etc.</i> were affected. This
    leads to spooky, incorrect action at a distance that is hard to debug.</p>
<p class="Pp">This means you would have to be very careful of the load
  order:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  # called module
  package Module_IN_BAR;
  use encoding &quot;bar&quot;;
  # stuff in &quot;bar&quot; encoding here

  # caller script
  use encoding &quot;foo&quot;
  use Module_IN_BAR;
  # surprise! use encoding &quot;bar&quot; is in effect.
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The best way to avoid this oddity is to use this pragma RIGHT
    AFTER other modules are loaded. i.e.</p>

  <dt>literals in regex that are longer than 127 bytes</dt>
  <dd>For native multibyte encodings (either fixed or variable length), the

  <dt>EBCDIC</dt>
  <dd>The encoding pragma is not supported on EBCDIC platforms.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;format&quot;</dt>
  <dd>This pragma doesn't work well with
      <span class="Li">&quot;format&quot;</span> because PerlIO does not get
      along very well with it. When <span class="Li">&quot;format&quot;</span>
      contains non-ASCII characters it prints funny or gets &quot;wide character
      warnings&quot;. To understand it, try the code below.
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
  # Save this one in utf8
  # replace *non-ascii* with a non-ascii string
  my $camel;
  format STDOUT =
  *non-ascii*@&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
  $camel
  .
  $camel = &quot;*non-ascii*&quot;;
  binmode(STDOUT=&gt;':encoding(utf8)'); # bang!
  write;              # funny
  print $camel, &quot;\n&quot;; # fine
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Without binmode this happens to work but without binmode,
        <b>print()</b> fails instead of <b>write()</b>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">At any rate, the very use of
        <span class="Li">&quot;format&quot;</span> is questionable when it comes
        to unicode characters since you have to consider such things as
        character width (i.e. double-width for ideographs) and directions (i.e.
        BIDI for Arabic and Hebrew).</p>
