  <dd>The <span class="Li">&quot;ECHO&quot;</span> macro is now defined. This is
      used in a <span class="Li">&quot;dtrace&quot;</span> rule that was
      originally changed for FreeBSD, and the FreeBSD make apparently predefines
      it. The Solaris make does not predefine
      <span class="Li">&quot;ECHO&quot;</span> which broke this rule on Solaris.

  <li>Setting <span class="Li">$)</span> now properly sets supplementary group

  <li><span class="Li">&quot;readline @foo&quot;</span> now evaluates
      <span class="Li">@foo</span> in scalar context. Previously, it would be
      evaluated in list context, and since <b>readline()</b> pops only one
      argument from the stack, the stack could underflow, or be left with
      unexpected values on it. [perl #16929]
      &lt;https://github.com/perl/perl5/issues/16929&gt;</li>
  <li><b>sv_gets()</b> now recovers better if the target SV is modified by a

  <li>Matching a non-<span class="Li">&quot;SVf_UTF8&quot;</span> string against

  <li><span class="Li">&quot;sprintf(&quot;%.*a&quot;, -10000, $x)&quot;</span>

<p class="Pp">Perl 5.30.1 represents approximately 6 months of development since
    Perl 5.30.0 and contains approximately 4,700 lines of changes across 67
    files from 14 authors.</p>
<p class="Pp">Excluding auto-generated files, documentation and release tools,
    there were approximately 910 lines of changes to 20 .pm, .t, .c and .h
    files.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl continues to flourish into its fourth decade thanks to a
    vibrant community of users and developers. The following people are known to
    have contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.30.1:</p>
<p class="Pp">Chris 'BinGOs' Williams, Dan Book, David Mitchell, Hugo van der
    Sanden, James E Keenan, Karen Etheridge, Karl Williamson, Manuel Mausz, Max
    Maischein, Nicolas R., Sawyer X, Steve Hay, Tom Hukins, Tony Cook.</p>
<p class="Pp">The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is
    automatically generated from version control history. In particular, it does
    not include the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who
    reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.</p>
<p class="Pp">Many of the changes included in this version originated in the
    CPAN modules included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire CPAN
    community for helping Perl to flourish.</p>
<p class="Pp">For a more complete list of all of Perl's historical contributors,

<p class="Pp">If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug

    perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make
