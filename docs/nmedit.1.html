<p class="Pp"><i>Nmedit</i> changes the global symbols not listed in the
    <i>list_file</i> file of the <b>-s</b> <i>list_file</i> option to static
    symbols. Undefined symbols and common symbols are not affected and shouldn't
    be listed in <i>list_file.</i> For dynamic libraries symbols are turned into
    private extern symbols that are no longer external (rather than static
    symbols). This is done so that the references between modules of a dynamic
    library are resolved to the symbols in the dynamic library. <i>Nmedit</i>
    differs from <i>strip</i>(1) in that it also changes the symbolic debugging
    information (produce by the <b>-g</b> option to <i>cc</i>(1)) for the global
    symbols it changes to static symbols so that the resulting object can still
    be used with the debugger.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Nmedit</i> like <i>strip</i>(1) is useful to limit the symbols
    for use with later linking. This allows control of the interface that the
    executable wants to provide to the objects that it will dynamically load,
    and it will not have to publish symbols that are not part of its interface.
    For example an executable that wishes to allow only a subset of its global
    symbols but all of the shared libraries globals to be used would have its
    symbol table edited with:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">% nmedit -s interface_symbols -A executable</div>
where the file <i>interface_symbols</i> would contain only those symbols from
  the executable that it wishes the objects loaded at runtime to have access to.
  Another example is an object that is made up of a number of other objects that
  will be loaded into an executable would built and then have its symbol table
  edited with:
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>% ld -o relocatable.o -r a.o b.o c.o
% nmedit -s interface_symbols relocatable.o</pre>
</div>
which would leave only the symbols listed in the file <i>interface_symbols</i>
  (and the undefined and common symbols) as global symbols in the object file.
<p class="Pp">The one or more of the following options is required to
    <i>nmedit</i>(1) is:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="s"><a class="permalink" href="#s"><b>-s</b><i> filename</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Leave the symbol table entries for the global symbols listed in
      <i>filename</i> global but turn all other global symbols (except undefined
      and common symbols) into static symbols. The symbol names listed in
      <i>filename</i> must be one per line. Leading and trailing white space are
      not part of the symbol name. Lines starting with # are ignored, as are
      lines with only white space.</dd>
  <dt id="R"><a class="permalink" href="#R"><b>-R</b><i> filename</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Change the symbol table entries for the global symbols listed in
      <i>filename</i> into static symbols. This file has the same format as the
      <b>-s</b> <i>filename</i> option above. If the <b>-R</b><i> filename</i>
      option is specified without the <b>-s</b><i> filename</i> option, then all
      symbols not listed in the <b>-R</b><i> filename</i> option's filename are
      left as globals. If both a <b>-R</b><i> filename</i> and a <b>-s</b><i>
      filename</i> are given the symbols listed in the <b>-R</b><i> filename</i>
      are basically ignored and only those symbols listed in the <b>-s</b><i>
      filename</i> are saved.</dd>
  <dt id="p"><a class="permalink" href="#p"><b>-p</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Change symbols to private externs instead of static. This is allowed as
      the only option to change all defined global symbols to private
    externs.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The options to <i>nmedit</i>(1) are:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="A"><a class="permalink" href="#A"><b>-A</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Leave all global absolute symbols except those with a value of zero, and
      save objective-C class symbols as globals. This is intended for use of
      programs that load code at runtime and want the loaded code to use symbols
      from the shared libraries.</dd>
  <dt id="D"><a class="permalink" href="#D"><b>-D</b></a></dt>
  <dd>When editing a static library, set the archive's SYMDEF file's user id,
      group id, date, and file mode to reasonable defaults. See the
      <i>libtool</i>(1) documentation for <b>-D</b> for more information.</dd>
  <dt><b>-</b></dt>
  <dd>Treat all remaining arguments as file names and not options.</dd>
  <dt id="arch"><a class="permalink" href="#arch"><b>-arch</b><i>
    arch_type</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Specifies the architecture, <i>arch_type,</i> of the file for
      <i>nmedit</i>(1) to process when the file is a universal file (see
      <i>arch</i>(3) for the currently know <i>arch_type</i>s). The
      <i>arch_type</i> can be <i>all</i> to process all architectures in the
      file. The default is to process all architectures that are contained in
      the file.</dd>
  <dt id="o"><a class="permalink" href="#o"><b>-o</b><i> output</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Write the result into the file <i>output.</i></dd>
