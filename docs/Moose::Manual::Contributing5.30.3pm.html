As Moose has matured, some structure has emerged in the process.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>Cabal - people who can release moose</dt>
  <dd>These people are the ones who have co-maint on Moose itself and can create
      a release. They're listed under &quot;CABAL&quot; in Moose in the Moose
      documentation. They are responsible for reviewing branches, and are the
      only people who are allowed to push to stable branches.
    <p class="Pp">Cabal members are listed in Moose and can often be found on
        irc in the &lt;irc://irc.perl.org/#moose-dev&gt; channel.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="New_Features"><a class="permalink" href="#New_Features">New
  Features</a></h2>
Moose already has a fairly large feature set, and we are currently <b>not</b>
  looking to add any major new features to it. If you have an idea for a new
  feature in Moose, you are encouraged to create a MooseX module first.
<p class="Pp">At this stage, no new features will even be considered for
    addition into the core without first being vetted as a MooseX module, unless
    it is absolutely 100% impossible to implement the feature outside the
  core.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you think it is 100% impossible, please come discuss it with us
    on IRC or via e-mail. Your feature may need a small hook in the core, or a
    refactoring of some core modules, and we are definitely open to that.</p>
<p class="Pp">Moose was built from the ground up with the idea of being highly
    extensible, and quite often the feature requests we see can be implemented
    through small extensions. Try it, it's much easier than you might think.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Branch_Layout"><a class="permalink" href="#Branch_Layout">Branch
  Layout</a></h2>
The repository is divided into several branches to make maintenance easier for
  everyone involved. The branches below are ordered by level of stability.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>stable/*</dt>
  <dd>The branch from which releases are cut. When making a new major release,
      the release manager makes a new
      <span class="Li">&quot;stable/X.YY&quot;</span> branch at the current
      position of <span class="Li">&quot;master&quot;</span>. The version used
      in the stable branch should not include the last two digits of the version
      number.
    <p class="Pp">For minor releases, patches will be committed to
        <span class="Li">&quot;master&quot;</span>, and backported
        (cherry-picked) to the appropriate stable branch as needed. A stable
        branch is only updated by someone from the Cabal during a release.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>master</dt>
  <dd>The main development branch. All new code should be written against this
      branch. This branch contains code that has been reviewed, and will be
      included in the next major release. Commits which are judged to not break
      backwards compatibility may be backported into
      <span class="Li">&quot;stable&quot;</span> to be included in the next
      minor release.</dd>
  <dt>topic/*</dt>
  <dd>Small personal branches that are still in progress. They can be freely
      rebased. They contain targeted features that may span a handful of
      commits. Any change or bugfix should be created in a topic branch.</dd>
  <dt>rfc/*</dt>
  <dd>Topic branches that are completed and waiting on review. A Cabal member
      will look over branches in this namespace, and either merge them to
      <span class="Li">&quot;master&quot;</span> if they are acceptable, or move
      them back to a different namespace otherwise. This namespace is being
      phased out now that we are using GitHub's pull requests in our
      &quot;Development Workflow&quot;.</dd>
  <dt>attic/*</dt>
  <dd>Branches which have been reviewed, and rejected. They remain in the
      repository in case we later change our mind, or in case parts of them are
      still useful.</dd>
  <dt>abandoned/*</dt>
  <dd>Topic branches which have had no activity for a long period of time will
      be moved here, to keep the main areas clean.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Larger, longer term branches can also be created in the root
    namespace (i.e. at the same level as master and stable). This may be
    appropriate if multiple people are intending to work on the branch. These
    branches should not be rebased without checking with other developers
  first.</p>

So, you've cloned the main Moose repository to your local machine (see &quot;Get
  the Code&quot;) and you're ready to do some hacking. We couldn't be happier to
  welcome you to our community!
<p class="Pp">Of course, to ensure that your first experience is as productive
    and satisfying as possible, you should probably take some time to read over
    this entire POD document. Doing so will give you a full understanding of how
    Moose developers and maintainers work together and what they expect from one
    another. Done? Great!</p>
<p class="Pp">Next, assuming you have a GitHub account, go to
    &lt;http://github.com/moose/Moose&gt; and <b>fork the repository</b> (see
    &lt;https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo&gt;). This will put an
    exact replica of the Moose repository into your GitHub account, which will
    serve as a place to publish your patches for the Moose maintainers to review
    and incorporate.</p>
<p class="Pp">Once your fork has been created, switch to your local working
    repository directory and update your
    <span class="Li">&quot;origin&quot;</span> remote's push URL. This allows
    you to use a single remote (<span class="Li">&quot;origin&quot;</span>) to
    both pull in the latest code from GitHub and also push your work to your own
    fork:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    # Replace YOUR_USERNAME below with your GitHub username
    git remote set-url --push origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/moose.git
</pre>
<p class="Pp">You can verify your work:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    $ git remote -v
    origin  git@github.com:moose/Moose.git (fetch)
    origin  git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/moose.git (push)
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Now, you're ready for action! From now on, you just follow the
    &quot;Development Workflow&quot; to publish your work and <b>submit pull
    requests</b> to the Moose Cabal.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Development_Workflow"><a class="permalink" href="#Development_Workflow">Development
  Workflow</a></h2>
The general gist of the <b>STANDARD WORKFLOW</b> is:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>1. Update your local repository with the latest commits from the official
    repository</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>2. Create a new topic branch, based on the master branch</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>3. Hack away</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>4. Commit and push the topic branch to your forked repository</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>5. Submit a pull request through GitHub for that branch</dt>
  <dd></dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">What follows is a more detailed rundown of that workflow. Please
    make sure to review and follow the steps in the previous section,
    &quot;Getting Started&quot;, if you have not done so already.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Update Your Repository</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Update your local copy of the master branch from the remote:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    git checkout master
    git pull --rebase
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><i>Create Your Topic Branch</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Now, create a new topic branch based on your master branch. It's
    useful to use concise, descriptive branch names such as: pod-syntax-contrib,
    feat-autodelegation, patch-23-role-comp, etc. However, we'll just call ours
    <span class="Li">&quot;my-feature&quot;</span> for demonstration
  purposes:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    git checkout -b topic/my-feature
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><i>Hack. Commit. Repeat.</i></p>
<p class="Pp">While you're hacking, the most important thing to remember is that
    your topic branch is yours to do with as you like. Nothing you do there will
    affect anyone else at this point. Commit as often as little or as often as
    you need to and don't let perfection get in the way of progress. However,
    don't try to do too much as the easiest changes to integrate are small and
    focused.</p>
<p class="Pp">If it's been a while since you created your topic branch, it's
    often a good idea to periodically rebase your branch off of the upstream
    master to reduce your work later on:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    git fetch                   # or, git remote update
    git rebase origin/master    # or, git pull --rebase origin master
</pre>
<p class="Pp">You should also feel free to publish (using
    <span class="Li">&quot;push --force&quot;</span> if necessary) your branch
    to your GitHub fork if you simply need feedback from others. (Note: actual
    collaboration takes a bit more finesse and a lot less
    <span class="Li">&quot;--force&quot;</span> however).</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Clean Up Your Branch</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Finally, when your development is done, it's time to prepare your
    branch for review. Even the smallest branches can often use a little bit of
    tidying up before they are unleashed on a reviewer. Clarifying/cleaning up
    commit messages, reordering commits, splitting large commits or those which
    contain different types of changes, squashing related or straggler commits
    are all <b>highly</b> worthwhile activities to undertake on your topic
    branch.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Remember:</b> Your topic branch is yours. Don't worry about
    rewriting its history or breaking fast-forward. Some useful commands are
    listed below but please make sure that you understand what they do as they
    can rewrite history:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    - git commit --amend
    - git rebase --interactive
    - git cherry-pick
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Ultimately, your goal in cleaning up your branch is to craft a set
    of commits whose content and messages are as focused and understandable as
    possible. Doing so will greatly increase the chances of a speedy review and
    acceptance into the mainline development.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Rebase on the Latest</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Before your final push and issuing a pull request, you need to
    ensure that your changes can be easily merged into the master branch of the
    upstream repository. This is done by once again rebasing your branch on the
    latest <span class="Li">&quot;origin/master&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    git fetch                   # or, git remote update
    git rebase origin/master    # or, git pull --rebase origin master
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><i>Publish and Pull Request</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Now it's time to make your final push of the branch to your fork.
    The <span class="Li">&quot;--force&quot;</span> flag is only necessary if
    you've pushed before and subsequently rewriting your history:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    git push --force
</pre>
<p class="Pp">After your branch is published, you can issue a pull request to
    the Moose Cabal. See
    &lt;https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests&gt; for
  details.</p>
<p class="Pp">Congratulations! You're now a contributor!</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Approval_Workflow"><a class="permalink" href="#Approval_Workflow">Approval
  Workflow</a></h2>
Moose is an open project but it is also an increasingly important one. Many
  modules depend on Moose being stable. Therefore, we have a basic set of
  criteria for reviewing and merging branches. What follows is a set of rough
  guidelines that ensures all new code is properly vetted before it is merged to
  the master branch.
<p class="Pp">It should be noted that if you want your specific branch to be
    approved, it is <b>your</b> responsibility to follow this process and
    advocate for your branch.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>Small bug fixes, doc patches and additional passing tests.</dt>
  <dd>These items don't really require approval beyond one of the core
      contributors just doing a simple review. For especially simple patches
      (doc patches especially), committing directly to master is fine.</dd>
  <dt>Larger bug fixes, doc additions and TODO or failing tests.</dt>
  <dd>Larger bug fixes should be reviewed by at least one cabal member and
      should be tested using the <i>xt/author/test-my-dependents.t</i> test.
    <p class="Pp">New documentation is always welcome, but should also be
        reviewed by a cabal member for accuracy.</p>
    <p class="Pp">TODO tests are basically feature requests, see our &quot;New
        Features&quot; section for more information on that. If your feature
        needs core support, create a <span class="Li">&quot;topic/&quot;</span>
        branch using the &quot;Development Workflow&quot; and start hacking
        away.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Failing tests are basically bug reports. You should find a
        core contributor and/or cabal member to see if it is a real bug, then
        submit the bug and your test to the RT queue. Source control is not a
        bug reporting tool.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>New user-facing features.</dt>
  <dd>Anything that creates a new user-visible feature needs to be approved by
      <b>more than one</b> cabal member.
    <p class="Pp">Make sure you have reviewed &quot;New Features&quot; to be
        sure that you are following the guidelines. Do not be surprised if a new
        feature is rejected for the core.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>New internals features.</dt>
  <dd>New features for Moose internals are less restrictive than user facing
      features, but still require approval by <b>at least one</b> cabal member.
    <p class="Pp">Ideally you will have run the
        <i>xt/author/test-my-dependents.t</i> script to be sure you are not
        breaking any MooseX module or causing any other unforeseen havoc. If you
        do this (rather than make us do it), it will only help to hasten your
        branch's approval.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Backwards incompatible changes.</dt>
  <dd>Anything that breaks backwards compatibility must be discussed by the
      cabal. Backwards incompatible changes should not be merged to master if
      there are strong objections from any cabal members.
    <p class="Pp">We have a policy for what we see as sane &quot;BACKWARDS
        COMPATIBILITY&quot; for Moose. If your changes break back-compat, you
        must be ready to discuss and defend your change.</p>

    # major releases (including trial releases)
    git checkout master

    # minor releases
    git checkout stable/X.YY

    # do final changelogging, etc
    vim dist.ini # increment version number
    git commit
    dzil release # or dzil release --trial for trial releases
    git commit # to add the actual release date
    git branch stable/X.YY # only for non-trial major releases
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><i>Release How-To</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Moose uses Dist::Zilla to manage releases. Although the git
    repository comes with a <span class="Li">&quot;Makefile.PL&quot;</span>, it
    is a very basic one just to allow the basic <span class="Li">&quot;perl
    Makefile.PL &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make test&quot;</span> cycle to work.
    In particular, it doesn't include any release metadata, such as
    dependencies. In order to get started with Dist::Zilla, first install it:
    <span class="Li">&quot;cpanm Dist::Zilla&quot;</span>, and then install the
    plugins necessary for reading the
    <span class="Li">&quot;dist.ini&quot;</span>: <span class="Li">&quot;dzil
    authordeps | cpanm&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Moose releases fall into two categories, each with their own level
    of release preparation. A minor release is one which does not include any
    API changes, deprecations, and so on. In that case, it is sufficient to
    simply test the release candidate against a few different Perls. Testing
    should be done against at least two recent major versions of Perl (5.8.8 and
    5.10.1, for example). If you have more versions available, you are
    encouraged to test them all. However, we do not put a lot of effort into
    supporting older 5.8.x releases.</p>
<p class="Pp">For major releases which include an API change or deprecation, you
    should run the <i>xt/author/test-my-dependents.t</i> test. This tests a long
    list of MooseX and other Moose-using modules from CPAN. In order to run this
    script, you must arrange to have the new version of Moose in Perl's include
    path. You can use <span class="Li">&quot;prove -b&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;prove -I&quot;</span>, install the module, or fiddle
    with the <span class="Li">&quot;PERL5LIB&quot;</span> environment variable,
    whatever makes you happy.</p>
<p class="Pp">This test downloads each module from CPAN, runs its tests, and
    logs failures and warnings to a set of files named
    <i>test-mydeps-$$-*.log</i>. If there are failures or warnings, please work
    with the authors of the modules in question to fix them. If the module
    author simply isn't available or does not want to fix the bug, it is okay to
    make a release.</p>
<p class="Pp">Regardless of whether or not a new module is available, any
    breakages should be noted in the conflicts list in the distribution's
    <i>dist.ini</i>.</p>

For longer lasting branches, we use a subversion style branch layout, where
  master is routinely merged into the branch. Rebasing is allowed as long as all
  the branch contributors are using <span class="Li">&quot;git pull
  --rebase&quot;</span> properly.
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;commit --amend&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;rebase --interactive&quot;</span>, etc. are not
    allowed, and should only be done in topic branches. Committing to master is
    still done with the same review process as a topic branch, and the branch
    must merge as a fast forward.</p>
<p class="Pp">This is pretty much the way we're doing branches for large-ish
    things right now.</p>
<p class="Pp">Obviously there is no technical limitation on the number of
    branches. You can freely create topic branches off of project branches, or
    sub projects inside larger projects freely. Such branches should incorporate
    the name of the branch they were made off so that people don't accidentally
    assume they should be merged into master:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    git checkout -b my-project--topic/foo my-project
</pre>
<p class="Pp">(unfortunately Git will not allow
    <span class="Li">&quot;my-project/foo&quot;</span> as a branch name if

    comments either near the code in question or in the test so that others
    know.</p>
<p class="Pp">We also greatly appreciate documentation to go with your changes,
    and an entry in the Changes file. Make sure to give yourself credit! Major
    changes or new user-facing features should also be documented in
    Moose::Manual::Delta.</p>

Any user-facing changes must be accompanied by documentation. If you're not
  comfortable writing docs yourself, you might be able to convince another Moose
  dev to help you.
<p class="Pp">Our goal is to make sure that all features are documented.
    Undocumented features are not considered part of the API when it comes to
    determining whether a change is backwards compatible.</p>

  COMPATIBILITY</a></h1>
Change is inevitable, and Moose is not immune to this. We do our best to
  maintain backwards compatibility, but we do not want the code base to become
  overburdened by this. This is not to say that we will be frivolous with our
  changes, quite the opposite, just that we are not afraid of change and will do
  our best to keep it as painless as possible for the end user.
<p class="Pp">Our policy for handling backwards compatibility is documented in
    more detail in Moose::Manual::Support.</p>
<p class="Pp">All backwards incompatible changes <b>must</b> be documented in
    Moose::Manual::Delta. Make sure to document any useful tips or workarounds
    for the change in that document.</p>
