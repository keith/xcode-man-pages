    information from a network entity via SNMP</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">

<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The <b>snmpnetstat</b> command symbolically displays the values of
    various network-related information retrieved from a remote system using the
    SNMP protocol. There are a number of output formats, depending on the
    options for the information presented. The first form of the command
    displays a list of active sockets. The second form presents the values of
    other network-related information according to the option selected. Using
    the third form, with an <i>interval</i> specified, <i>snmpnetstat</i> will
    continuously display the information regarding packet traffic on the
    configured network interfaces. The fourth form displays statistics about the
    named protocol.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>snmpnetstat</b> will issue GETBULK requests to query for
    information if at least protocol version <i>v2</i> is used.</p>
<p class="Pp">AGENT identifies a target SNMP agent, which is instrumented to
    monitor the given objects. At its simplest, the AGENT specification will
    consist of a hostname or an IPv4 address. In this situation, the command
    will attempt communication with the agent, using UDP/IPv4 to port 161 of the
    given target host. See snmpcmd(1) for a full list of the possible formats
    for AGENT.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The options have the following meaning:</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>COMMON OPTIONS</b>
  <br/>
   Please see <i>snmpcmd(1)</i> for a list of possible values for common options
    as well as their descriptions.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>-Ca</b> With the default display, show the state of all
    sockets; normally sockets used by server processes are not shown.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>-Ci</b> Show the state of all of the network interfaces. The
    interface display provides a table of cumulative statistics regarding
    packets transferred, errors, and collisions. The network addresses of the
    interface and the maximum transmission unit (``mtu'') are also
  displayed.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>-Co</b> Show an abbreviated interface status, giving octets in
    place of packets. This is useful when enquiring virtual interfaces (such as
    Frame-Relay circuits) on a router.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>-CI</b><i> interface</i> Show information only about this
    interface; used with an <i>interval</i> as described below.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>-Cn</b> Show network addresses as numbers (normally
    <i>snmpnetstat</i> interprets addresses and attempts to display them
    symbolically). This option may be used with any of the display formats.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>-Cp</b><i> protocol</i> Show statistics about <i>protocol,</i>
    which is either a well-known name for a protocol or an alias for it. Some
    protocol names and aliases are listed in the file <i>/etc/protocols</i>. A
    null response typically means that there are no interesting numbers to
    report. The program will complain if <i>protocol</i> is unknown or if there
    is no statistics routine for it.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>-Cs</b> Show per-protocol statistics. When used with the
    <b>-Cr</b> option, show routing statistics instead.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>-Cr</b> Show the routing tables. When <b>-Cs</b> is also
    present, show per-protocol routing statistics instead of the routing
  tables.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>-CR</b><i> repeaters</i> For GETBULK requests, <i>repeaters</i>
    specifies the max-repeaters value to use.</p>
<p class="Pp">When snmpnetstat is invoked with an interval argument, it displays
    a running count of statistics related to network interfaces. <i>interval</i>
    is the number of seconds between reporting of statistics.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>The Active Sockets Display (default)</i></p>
<p class="Pp">The default display, for active sockets, shows the local and
    remote addresses, protocol, and the internal state of the protocol. Address
    formats are of the form ``host.port'' or ``network.port'' if a socket's
    address specifies a network but no specific host address. When known, the
    host and network addresses are displayed symbolically according to the data
    bases <i>/etc/hosts and</i> <i>/etc/networks,</i> respectively. If a
    symbolic name for an address is unknown, or if the <b>-Cn</b> option is
    specified, the address is printed numerically, according to the address
    family. For more information regarding the Internet ``dot format,'' refer to
    <i>inet(3N).</i> Unspecified, or ``wildcard'', addresses and ports appear as
    ``*''.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>The Interface Display</i></p>
<p class="Pp">The interface display provides a table of cumulative statistics
    regarding packets transferred, errors, and col- lisions. The network
    addresses of the interface and the maximum transmission unit (``mtu'') are
    also displayed.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>The Routing Table Display</i></p>
<p class="Pp">The routing table display indicates the available routes and their
    status. Each route consists of a destination host or network and a gateway
    to use in forwarding pack- ets. The flags field shows the state of the route
    (``U'' if ``up''), whether the route is to a gateway (``G''), whether the
    route was created dynamically by a redirect (``D''), and whether the route
    has been modified by a redirect (``M''). Direct routes are created for each
    interface attached to the local host; the gateway field for such entries
    shows the address of the outgoing inter- face. The interface entry indicates
    the network interface utilized for the route.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>The Interface Display with an Interval</i></p>
<p class="Pp">When <i>snmpnetstat</i> is invoked with an <i>interval</i>
    argument, it displays a running count of statistics related to network
    interfaces. This display consists of a column for the primary interface and
    a column summarizing information for all interfaces. The primary interface
    may be replaced with another interface with the <b>-CI</b> option. The first
    line of each screen of information contains a summary since the system was
    last rebooted. Subsequent lines of output show values accumulated over the
    preceding interval.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>The Active Sockets Display for a</i> <i>Single Protocol</i></p>
<p class="Pp">When a protocol is specified with the <b>-Cp</b> option, the
    information displayed is similar to that in the default display for active
    sockets, except the display is limited to the given protocol.</p>
