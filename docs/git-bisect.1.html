<pre>

<p class="Pp">This command uses a binary search algorithm to find which commit
    in your project&#x2019;s history introduced a bug. You use it by first
    telling it a &quot;bad&quot; commit that is known to contain the bug, and a
    &quot;good&quot; commit that is known to be before the bug was introduced.
    Then <b>git bisect</b> picks a commit between those two endpoints and asks
    you whether the selected commit is &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot;. It
    continues narrowing down the range until it finds the exact commit that
    introduced the change.</p>
<p class="Pp">In fact, <b>git bisect</b> can be used to find the commit that
    changed <b>any</b> property of your project; e.g., the commit that fixed a
    bug, or the commit that caused a benchmark&#x2019;s performance to improve.
    To support this more general usage, the terms &quot;old&quot; and
    &quot;new&quot; can be used in place of &quot;good&quot; and
    &quot;bad&quot;, or you can choose your own terms. See section
    &quot;Alternate terms&quot; below for more information.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Basic_bisect_commands:_start,_bad,_good"><a class="permalink" href="#Basic_bisect_commands:_start,_bad,_good">Basic
  bisect commands: start, bad, good</a></h2>
As an example, suppose you are trying to find the commit that broke a feature
  that was known to work in version <b>v2.6.13-rc2</b> of your project. You
  start a bisect session as follows:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ git bisect start
$ git bisect bad                 # Current version is bad
$ git bisect good v2.6.13-rc2    # v2.6.13-rc2 is known to be good
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">Once you have specified at least one bad and one good commit,
    <b>git bisect</b> selects a commit in the middle of that range of history,
    checks it out, and outputs something similar to the following:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
Bisecting: 675 revisions left to test after this (roughly 10 steps)
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">You should now compile the checked-out version and test it. If
    that version works correctly, type</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ git bisect good
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">If that version is broken, type</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ git bisect bad
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">Then <b>git bisect</b> will respond with something like</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
Bisecting: 337 revisions left to test after this (roughly 9 steps)
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">Keep repeating the process: compile the tree, test it, and
    depending on whether it is good or bad run <b>git bisect good</b> or <b>git
    bisect bad</b> to ask for the next commit that needs testing.</p>
<p class="Pp">Eventually there will be no more revisions left to inspect, and
    the command will print out a description of the first bad commit. The
    reference <b>refs/bisect/bad</b> will be left pointing at that commit.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Bisect_reset"><a class="permalink" href="#Bisect_reset">Bisect

After a bisect session, to clean up the bisection state and return to the
  original HEAD, issue the following command:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ git bisect reset
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">By default, this will return your tree to the commit that was
    checked out before <b>git bisect start</b>. (A new <b>git bisect start</b>
    will also do that, as it cleans up the old bisection state.)</p>
<p class="Pp">With an optional argument, you can return to a different commit
    instead:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ git bisect reset &lt;commit&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">For example, <b>git bisect reset bisect/bad</b> will check out the
    first bad revision, while <b>git bisect reset HEAD</b> will leave you on the
    current bisection commit and avoid switching commits at all.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Alternate_terms"><a class="permalink" href="#Alternate_terms">Alternate
  terms</a></h2>
Sometimes you are not looking for the commit that introduced a breakage, but
  rather for a commit that caused a change between some other &quot;old&quot;
  state and &quot;new&quot; state. For example, you might be looking for the
  commit that introduced a particular fix. Or you might be looking for the first
  commit in which the source-code filenames were finally all converted to your
  company&#x2019;s naming standard. Or whatever.
<p class="Pp">In such cases it can be very confusing to use the terms
    &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; to refer to &quot;the state before the
    change&quot; and &quot;the state after the change&quot;. So instead, you can
    use the terms &quot;old&quot; and &quot;new&quot;, respectively, in place of
    &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot;. (But note that you cannot mix
    &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; with &quot;old&quot; and
    &quot;new&quot; in a single session.)</p>
<p class="Pp">In this more general usage, you provide <b>git bisect</b> with a
    &quot;new&quot; commit that has some property and an &quot;old&quot; commit
    that doesn&#x2019;t have that property. Each time <b>git bisect</b> checks
    out a commit, you test if that commit has the property. If it does, mark the
    commit as &quot;new&quot;; otherwise, mark it as &quot;old&quot;. When the
    bisection is done, <b>git bisect</b> will report which commit introduced the
    property.</p>
<p class="Pp">To use &quot;old&quot; and &quot;new&quot; instead of
    &quot;good&quot; and bad, you must run <b>git bisect start</b> without
    commits as argument and then run the following commands to add the
  commits:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
git bisect old [&lt;rev&gt;]
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">to indicate that a commit was before the sought change, or</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
git bisect new [&lt;rev&gt;...]
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">to indicate that it was after.</p>
<p class="Pp">To get a reminder of the currently used terms, use</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
git bisect terms
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">You can get just the old (respectively new) term with <b>git
    bisect terms --term-old</b> or <b>git bisect terms --term-good</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you would like to use your own terms instead of
    &quot;bad&quot;/&quot;good&quot; or &quot;new&quot;/&quot;old&quot;, you can
    choose any names you like (except existing bisect subcommands like
    <b>reset</b>, <b>start</b>, ...) by starting the bisection using</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
git bisect start --term-old &lt;term-old&gt; --term-new &lt;term-new&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">For example, if you are looking for a commit that introduced a
    performance regression, you might use</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
git bisect start --term-old fast --term-new slow
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">Or if you are looking for the commit that fixed a bug, you might
    use</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
git bisect start --term-new fixed --term-old broken
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">Then, use <b>git bisect &lt;term-old&gt;</b> and <b>git bisect
    &lt;term-new&gt;</b> instead of <b>git bisect good</b> and <b>git bisect
    bad</b> to mark commits.</p>

To see the currently remaining suspects in <i>gitk</i>, issue the following
  command during the bisection process (the subcommand <b>view</b> can be used
  as an alternative to <b>visualize</b>):
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>

<p class="Pp">If you discover that you made a mistake in specifying the status

    remove the incorrect entries, and then issue the following commands to
    return to a corrected state:</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Avoiding_testing_a_commit"><a class="permalink" href="#Avoiding_testing_a_commit">Avoiding

If, in the middle of a bisect session, you know that the suggested revision is
  not a good one to test (e.g. it fails to build and you know that the failure
  does not have anything to do with the bug you are chasing), you can manually
  select a nearby commit and test that one instead.
<p class="Pp">For example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ git bisect good/bad                   # previous round was good or bad.
Bisecting: 337 revisions left to test after this (roughly 9 steps)
$ git bisect visualize                  # oops, that is uninteresting.
$ git reset --hard HEAD~3               # try 3 revisions before what
                                        # was suggested
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">Then compile and test the chosen revision, and afterwards mark the
    revision as good or bad in the usual manner.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Bisect_skip"><a class="permalink" href="#Bisect_skip">Bisect
  skip</a></h2>
Instead of choosing a nearby commit by yourself, you can ask Git to do it for
  you by issuing the command:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ git bisect skip                 # Current version cannot be tested
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">However, if you skip a commit adjacent to the one you are looking
    for, Git will be unable to tell exactly which of those commits was the first
    bad one.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can also skip a range of commits, instead of just one commit,
    using range notation. For example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ git bisect skip v2.5..v2.6
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">This tells the bisect process that no commit after <b>v2.5</b>, up
    to and including <b>v2.6</b>, should be tested.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that if you also want to skip the first commit of the range
    you would issue the command:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ git bisect skip v2.5 v2.5..v2.6
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">This tells the bisect process that the commits between <b>v2.5</b>
    and <b>v2.6</b> (inclusive) should be skipped.</p>

  down bisection by giving more parameters to bisect start</a></h2>
You can further cut down the number of trials, if you know what part of the tree
  is involved in the problem you are tracking down, by specifying path
  parameters when issuing the <b>bisect start</b> command:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ git bisect start -- arch/i386 include/asm-i386
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">If you know beforehand more than one good commit, you can narrow
    the bisect space down by specifying all of the good commits immediately
    after the bad commit when issuing the <b>bisect start</b> command:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ git bisect start v2.6.20-rc6 v2.6.20-rc4 v2.6.20-rc1 --
                   # v2.6.20-rc6 is bad
                   # v2.6.20-rc4 and v2.6.20-rc1 are good
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Bisect_run"><a class="permalink" href="#Bisect_run">Bisect
  run</a></h2>
If you have a script that can tell if the current source code is good or bad,
  you can bisect by issuing the command:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ git bisect run my_script arguments
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">Note that the script (<b>my_script</b> in the above example)
    should exit with code 0 if the current source code is good/old, and exit
    with a code between 1 and 127 (inclusive), except 125, if the current source
    code is bad/new.</p>
<p class="Pp">Any other exit code will abort the bisect process. It should be
    noted that a program that terminates via <b>exit(-1)</b> leaves $? = 255,
    (see the exit(3) manual page), as the value is chopped with <b>&amp;
    0377</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The special exit code 125 should be used when the current source
    code cannot be tested. If the script exits with this code, the current
    revision will be skipped (see <b>git bisect skip</b> above). 125 was chosen
    as the highest sensible value to use for this purpose, because 126 and 127
    are used by POSIX shells to signal specific error status (127 is for command
    not found, 126 is for command found but not executable&#x2014;these details
    do not matter, as they are normal errors in the script, as far as <b>bisect
    run</b> is concerned).</p>
<p class="Pp">You may often find that during a bisect session you want to have
    temporary modifications (e.g. s/#define DEBUG 0/#define DEBUG 1/ in a header
    file, or &quot;revision that does not have this commit needs this patch
    applied to work around another problem this bisection is not interested
    in&quot;) applied to the revision being tested.</p>
<p class="Pp">To cope with such a situation, after the inner <i>git bisect</i>
    finds the next revision to test, the script can apply the patch before
    compiling, run the real test, and afterwards decide if the revision
    (possibly with the needed patch) passed the test and then rewind the tree to
    the pristine state. Finally the script should exit with the status of the
    real test to let the <b>git bisect run</b> command loop determine the
    eventual outcome of the bisect session.</p>
