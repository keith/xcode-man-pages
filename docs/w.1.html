The <code class="Nm">w</code> utility prints a summary of the current activity
  on the system, including what each user is doing. The first line displays the
  current time of day, how long the system has been running, the number of users
  logged into the system, and the load averages. The load average numbers give
  the number of jobs in the run queue averaged over 1, 5 and 15 minutes.
<p class="Pp">The fields output are the user's login name, the name of the
    terminal the user is on, the host from which the user is logged in, the time
    the user logged on, the time since the user last typed anything, and the
    name and arguments of the current process.</p>
<p class="Pp">The options are as follows:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><a class="permalink" href="#h"><code class="Fl" id="h">-h</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Suppress the heading.</dd>
  <dt><a class="permalink" href="#i"><code class="Fl" id="i">-i</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Output is sorted by idle time.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">If one or more <var class="Ar">user</var> names are specified, the
    output is restricted to those users.</p>

The notion of the &#x201C;current process&#x201D; is muddy. The current
  algorithm is ``the highest numbered process on the terminal that is not
  ignoring interrupts, or, if there is none, the highest numbered process on the
  terminal''. This fails, for example, in critical sections of programs like the
  shell and editor, or when faulty programs running in the background fork and
  fail to ignore interrupts. (In cases where no process can be found,
  <code class="Nm">w</code> prints &#x201C;-&#x201D;.)
<p class="Pp">The CPU time is only an estimate, in particular, if someone leaves
    a background process running after logging out, the person currently on that
    terminal is &#x201C;charged&#x201D; with the time.</p>
<p class="Pp">Background processes are not shown, even though they account for
    much of the load on the system.</p>
<p class="Pp">Sometimes processes, typically those in the background, are
    printed with null or garbaged arguments. In these cases, the name of the
    command is printed in parentheses.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <code class="Nm">w</code> utility does not know about the new
    conventions for detection of background jobs. It will sometimes find a
    background job instead of the right one.</p>
<p class="Pp">Long hostnames and IPv6 addresses may be truncated; however, the
    <a class="Xr">who(1)</a> utility will display full hostnames.</p>
