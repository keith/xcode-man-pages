<i>git filter-branch</i> has a plethora of pitfalls that can produce non-obvious
  manglings of the intended history rewrite (and can leave you with little time
  to investigate such problems since it has such abysmal performance). These
  safety and performance issues cannot be backward compatibly fixed and as such,
  its use is not recommended. Please use an alternative history filtering tool
  such as <b>git filter-repo</b>[1]. If you still need to use <i>git
  filter-branch</i>, please carefully read the section called
  &#x201C;SAFETY&#x201D; (and the section called &#x201C;PERFORMANCE&#x201D;) to
  learn about the land mines of filter-branch, and then vigilantly avoid as many
  of the hazards listed there as reasonably possible.

<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
Lets you rewrite Git revision history by rewriting the branches mentioned in the
  &lt;rev-list options&gt;, applying custom filters on each revision. Those
  filters can modify each tree (e.g. removing a file or running a perl rewrite
  on all files) or information about each commit. Otherwise, all information
  (including original commit times or merge information) will be preserved.
<p class="Pp">The command will only rewrite the <i>positive</i> refs mentioned
    in the command line (e.g. if you pass <i>a..b</i>, only <i>b</i> will be
    rewritten). If you specify no filters, the commits will be recommitted
    without any changes, which would normally have no effect. Nevertheless, this
    may be useful in the future for compensating for some Git bugs or such,
    therefore such a usage is permitted.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>NOTE</b>: This command honors <b>.git/info/grafts</b> file and
    refs in the <b>refs/replace/</b> namespace. If you have any grafts or
    replacement refs defined, running this command will make them permanent.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>WARNING</b>! The rewritten history will have different object
    names for all the objects and will not converge with the original branch.
    You will not be able to easily push and distribute the rewritten branch on
    top of the original branch. Please do not use this command if you do not
    know the full implications, and avoid using it anyway, if a simple single
    commit would suffice to fix your problem. (See the &quot;RECOVERING FROM
    UPSTREAM REBASE&quot; section in <b>git-rebase</b>(1) for further
    information about rewriting published history.)</p>
<p class="Pp">Always verify that the rewritten version is correct: The original
    refs, if different from the rewritten ones, will be stored in the namespace
    <i>refs/original/</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that since this operation is very I/O expensive, it might be
    a good idea to redirect the temporary directory off-disk with the <b>-d</b>
    option, e.g. on tmpfs. Reportedly the speedup is very noticeable.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Filters"><a class="permalink" href="#Filters">Filters</a></h2>
The filters are applied in the order as listed below. The &lt;command&gt;
  argument is always evaluated in the shell context using the <i>eval</i>
  command (with the notable exception of the commit filter, for technical
  reasons). Prior to that, the <b>$GIT_COMMIT</b> environment variable will be
  set to contain the id of the commit being rewritten. Also, GIT_AUTHOR_NAME,
  GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL, GIT_AUTHOR_DATE, GIT_COMMITTER_NAME, GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL,
  and GIT_COMMITTER_DATE are taken from the current commit and exported to the
  environment, in order to affect the author and committer identities of the
  replacement commit created by <b>git-commit-tree</b>(1) after the filters have
  run.
<p class="Pp">If any evaluation of &lt;command&gt; returns a non-zero exit
    status, the whole operation will be aborted.</p>
<p class="Pp">A <i>map</i> function is available that takes an &quot;original
    sha1 id&quot; argument and outputs a &quot;rewritten sha1 id&quot; if the
    commit has been already rewritten, and &quot;original sha1 id&quot;
    otherwise; the <i>map</i> function can return several ids on separate lines
    if your commit filter emitted multiple commits.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
--setup &lt;command&gt;
<div class="Bd-indent">This is not a real filter executed for each commit but a
  one time setup just before the loop. Therefore no commit-specific variables
  are defined yet. Functions or variables defined here can be used or modified
  in the following filter steps except the commit filter, for technical
  reasons.</div>
<p class="Pp">--subdirectory-filter &lt;directory&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Only look at the history which touches the given
  subdirectory. The result will contain that directory (and only that) as its
  project root. Implies the section called &#x201C;Remap to
  ancestor&#x201D;.</div>
<p class="Pp">--env-filter &lt;command&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This filter may be used if you only need to modify the
  environment in which the commit will be performed. Specifically, you might
  want to rewrite the author/committer name/email/time environment variables
  (see <b>git-commit-tree</b>(1) for details).</div>
<p class="Pp">--tree-filter &lt;command&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This is the filter for rewriting the tree and its
  contents. The argument is evaluated in shell with the working directory set to
  the root of the checked out tree. The new tree is then used as-is (new files
  are auto-added, disappeared files are auto-removed - neither .gitignore files
  nor any other ignore rules <b>HAVE ANY EFFECT</b>!).</div>
<p class="Pp">--index-filter &lt;command&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This is the filter for rewriting the index. It is similar
  to the tree filter but does not check out the tree, which makes it much
  faster. Frequently used with <b>git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch ...</b>, see
  EXAMPLES below. For hairy cases, see <b>git-update-index</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">--parent-filter &lt;command&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This is the filter for rewriting the commit&#x2019;s
  parent list. It will receive the parent string on stdin and shall output the
  new parent string on stdout. The parent string is in the format described in
  <b>git-commit-tree</b>(1): empty for the initial commit, &quot;-p parent&quot;
  for a normal commit and &quot;-p parent1 -p parent2 -p parent3 ...&quot; for a
  merge commit.</div>
<p class="Pp">--msg-filter &lt;command&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This is the filter for rewriting the commit messages. The
  argument is evaluated in the shell with the original commit message on
  standard input; its standard output is used as the new commit message.</div>
<p class="Pp">--commit-filter &lt;command&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This is the filter for performing the commit. If this
  filter is specified, it will be called instead of the <i>git commit-tree</i>
  command, with arguments of the form &quot;&lt;TREE_ID&gt; [(-p
  &lt;PARENT_COMMIT_ID&gt;)...]&quot; and the log message on stdin. The commit
  id is expected on stdout.
<p class="Pp">As a special extension, the commit filter may emit multiple commit
    ids; in that case, the rewritten children of the original commit will have
    all of them as parents.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can use the <i>map</i> convenience function in this filter,
    and other convenience functions, too. For example, calling <i>skip_commit
    &quot;$@&quot;</i> will leave out the current commit (but not its changes!
    If you want that, use <i>git rebase</i> instead).</p>
<p class="Pp">You can also use the <b>git_commit_non_empty_tree
    &quot;$@&quot;</b> instead of <b>git commit-tree &quot;$@&quot;</b> if you
    don&#x2019;t wish to keep commits with a single parent and that makes no
    change to the tree.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--tag-name-filter &lt;command&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This is the filter for rewriting tag names. When passed,
  it will be called for every tag ref that points to a rewritten object (or to a
  tag object which points to a rewritten object). The original tag name is
  passed via standard input, and the new tag name is expected on standard
  output.
<p class="Pp">The original tags are not deleted, but can be overwritten; use
    &quot;--tag-name-filter cat&quot; to simply update the tags. In this case,
    be very careful and make sure you have the old tags backed up in case the
    conversion has run afoul.</p>
<p class="Pp">Nearly proper rewriting of tag objects is supported. If the tag
    has a message attached, a new tag object will be created with the same
    message, author, and timestamp. If the tag has a signature attached, the
    signature will be stripped. It is by definition impossible to preserve
    signatures. The reason this is &quot;nearly&quot; proper, is because ideally
    if the tag did not change (points to the same object, has the same name,
    etc.) it should retain any signature. That is not the case, signatures will
    always be removed, buyer beware. There is also no support for changing the
    author or timestamp (or the tag message for that matter). Tags which point
    to other tags will be rewritten to point to the underlying commit.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--prune-empty</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Some filters will generate empty commits that leave the
  tree untouched. This option instructs git-filter-branch to remove such commits
  if they have exactly one or zero non-pruned parents; merge commits will
  therefore remain intact. This option cannot be used together with
  <b>--commit-filter</b>, though the same effect can be achieved by using the
  provided <b>git_commit_non_empty_tree</b> function in a commit filter.</div>
<p class="Pp">--original &lt;namespace&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Use this option to set the namespace where the original
  commits will be stored. The default value is <i>refs/original</i>.</div>
<p class="Pp">-d &lt;directory&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Use this option to set the path to the temporary
  directory used for rewriting. When applying a tree filter, the command needs
  to temporarily check out the tree to some directory, which may consume
  considerable space in case of large projects. By default it does this in the
  <b>.git-rewrite/</b> directory but you can override that choice by this
  parameter.</div>
<p class="Pp">-f, --force</p>
<div class="Bd-indent"><i>git filter-branch</i> refuses to start with an
  existing temporary directory or when there are already refs starting with
  <i>refs/original/</i>, unless forced.</div>
<p class="Pp">--state-branch &lt;branch&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This option will cause the mapping from old to new
  objects to be loaded from named branch upon startup and saved as a new commit
  to that branch upon exit, enabling incremental of large trees. If
  <i>&lt;branch&gt;</i> does not exist it will be created.</div>
<p class="Pp">&lt;rev-list options&gt;...</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Arguments for <i>git rev-list</i>. All positive refs
  included by these options are rewritten. You may also specify options such as
  <b>--all</b>, but you must use <b>--</b> to separate them from the <i>git
  filter-branch</i> options. Implies the section called &#x201C;Remap to
  ancestor&#x201D;.</div>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Remap_to_ancestor"><a class="permalink" href="#Remap_to_ancestor">Remap
  to ancestor</a></h2>
By using <b>git-rev-list</b>(1) arguments, e.g., path limiters, you can limit
  the set of revisions which get rewritten. However, positive refs on the
  command line are distinguished: we don&#x2019;t let them be excluded by such
  limiters. For this purpose, they are instead rewritten to point at the nearest
  ancestor that was not excluded.

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="EXIT_STATUS"><a class="permalink" href="#EXIT_STATUS">EXIT
  STATUS</a></h1>
On success, the exit status is <b>0</b>. If the filter can&#x2019;t find any
  commits to rewrite, the exit status is <b>2</b>. On any other error, the exit
  status may be any other non-zero value.

Suppose you want to remove a file (containing confidential information or
  copyright violation) from all commits:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
git filter-branch --tree-filter 'rm filename' HEAD
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">However, if the file is absent from the tree of some commit, a
    simple <b>rm filename</b> will fail for that tree and commit. Thus you may
    instead want to use <b>rm -f filename</b> as the script.</p>
<p class="Pp">Using <b>--index-filter</b> with <i>git rm</i> yields a
    significantly faster version. Like with using <b>rm filename</b>, <b>git rm
    --cached filename</b> will fail if the file is absent from the tree of a
    commit. If you want to &quot;completely forget&quot; a file, it does not
    matter when it entered history, so we also add <b>--ignore-unmatch</b>:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
git filter-branch --index-filter 'git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch filename' HEAD
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">Now, you will get the rewritten history saved in HEAD.</p>
<p class="Pp">To rewrite the repository to look as if <b>foodir/</b> had been
    its project root, and discard all other history:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
git filter-branch --subdirectory-filter foodir -- --all
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">Thus you can, e.g., turn a library subdirectory into a repository
    of its own. Note the <b>--</b> that separates <i>filter-branch</i> options
    from revision options, and the <b>--all</b> to rewrite all branches and
    tags.</p>
<p class="Pp">To set a commit (which typically is at the tip of another history)
    to be the parent of the current initial commit, in order to paste the other
    history behind the current history:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
git filter-branch --parent-filter 'sed &quot;s/^\$/-p &lt;graft-id&gt;/&quot;' HEAD
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">(if the parent string is empty - which happens when we are dealing
    with the initial commit - add graftcommit as a parent). Note that this
    assumes history with a single root (that is, no merge without common
    ancestors happened). If this is not the case, use:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
git filter-branch --parent-filter \
        'test $GIT_COMMIT = &lt;commit-id&gt; &amp;&amp; echo &quot;-p &lt;graft-id&gt;&quot; || cat' HEAD
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">or even simpler:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
git replace --graft $commit-id $graft-id
git filter-branch $graft-id..HEAD
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">To remove commits authored by &quot;Darl McBribe&quot; from the
    history:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
git filter-branch --commit-filter '
        if [ &quot;$GIT_AUTHOR_NAME&quot; = &quot;Darl McBribe&quot; ];
        then
                skip_commit &quot;$@&quot;;
        else
                git commit-tree &quot;$@&quot;;
        fi' HEAD
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">The function <i>skip_commit</i> is defined as follows:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
skip_commit()
{
        shift;
        while [ -n &quot;$1&quot; ];
        do
                shift;
                map &quot;$1&quot;;
                shift;
        done;
}
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">The shift magic first throws away the tree id and then the -p
    parameters. Note that this handles merges properly! In case Darl committed a
    merge between P1 and P2, it will be propagated properly and all children of
    the merge will become merge commits with P1,P2 as their parents instead of
    the merge commit.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>NOTE</b> the changes introduced by the commits, and which are
    not reverted by subsequent commits, will still be in the rewritten branch.
    If you want to throw out <i>changes</i> together with the commits, you
    should use the interactive mode of <i>git rebase</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can rewrite the commit log messages using <b>--msg-filter</b>.
    For example, <i>git svn-id</i> strings in a repository created by <i>git
    svn</i> can be removed this way:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
git filter-branch --msg-filter '
        sed -e &quot;/^git-svn-id:/d&quot;
'
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">If you need to add <i>Acked-by</i> lines to, say, the last 10
    commits (none of which is a merge), use this command:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
git filter-branch --msg-filter '
        cat &amp;&amp;
        echo &quot;Acked-by: Bugs Bunny &lt;bunny@bugzilla.org&gt;&quot;
' HEAD~10..HEAD
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>--env-filter</b> option can be used to modify committer
    and/or author identity. For example, if you found out that your commits have
    the wrong identity due to a misconfigured user.email, you can make a
    correction, before publishing the project, like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
git filter-branch --env-filter '
        if test &quot;$GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL&quot; = &quot;root@localhost&quot;
        then
                GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL=john@example.com
        fi
        if test &quot;$GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL&quot; = &quot;root@localhost&quot;
        then
                GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL=john@example.com
        fi
' -- --all
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">To restrict rewriting to only part of the history, specify a
    revision range in addition to the new branch name. The new branch name will
    point to the top-most revision that a <i>git rev-list</i> of this range will
    print.</p>
<p class="Pp">Consider this history:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
     D--E--F--G--H
    /     /
A--B-----C
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">To rewrite only commits D,E,F,G,H, but leave A, B and C alone,
    use:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
git filter-branch ... C..H
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">To rewrite commits E,F,G,H, use one of these:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
git filter-branch ... C..H --not D
git filter-branch ... D..H --not C
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">To move the whole tree into a subdirectory, or remove it from
    there:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
git filter-branch --index-filter \
        'git ls-files -s | sed &quot;s-\t\&quot;*-&amp;newsubdir/-&quot; |
                GIT_INDEX_FILE=$GIT_INDEX_FILE.new \
                        git update-index --index-info &amp;&amp;
         mv &quot;$GIT_INDEX_FILE.new&quot; &quot;$GIT_INDEX_FILE&quot;' HEAD

git-filter-branch can be used to get rid of a subset of files, usually with some
  combination of <b>--index-filter</b> and <b>--subdirectory-filter</b>. People
  expect the resulting repository to be smaller than the original, but you need
  a few more steps to actually make it smaller, because Git tries hard not to
  lose your objects until you tell it to. First make sure that:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;You really removed all variants of a filename, if
  a blob was moved over its lifetime. <b>git log --name-only --follow --all --
  filename</b> can help you find renames.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;You really filtered all refs: use
  <b>--tag-name-filter cat -- --all</b> when calling git-filter-branch.</div>
<p class="Pp">Then there are two ways to get a smaller repository. A safer way
    is to clone, that keeps your original intact.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Clone it with <b>git clone
  file:///path/to/repo</b>. The clone will not have the removed objects. See
  <b>git-clone</b>(1). (Note that cloning with a plain path just hardlinks
  everything!)</div>
<p class="Pp">If you really don&#x2019;t want to clone it, for whatever reasons,
    check the following points instead (in this order). This is a very
    destructive approach, so <b>make a backup</b> or go back to cloning it. You
    have been warned.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Remove the original refs backed up by
  git-filter-branch: say <b>git for-each-ref --format=&quot;%(refname)&quot;
  refs/original/ | xargs -n 1 git update-ref -d</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Expire all reflogs with <b>git reflog expire
  --expire=now --all</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Garbage collect all unreferenced objects with

  instead).</div>

<h1 class="Sh" id="PERFORMANCE"><a class="permalink" href="#PERFORMANCE">PERFORMANCE</a></h1>
The performance of git-filter-branch is glacially slow; its design makes it
  impossible for a backward-compatible implementation to ever be fast:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;In editing files, git-filter-branch by design
  checks out each and every commit as it existed in the original repo. If your
  repo has 10^5 files and 10^5 commits, but each commit only modifies 5 files,
  then git-filter-branch will make you do 10^10 modifications, despite only
  having (at most) 5*10^5 unique blobs.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;If you try and cheat and try to make
  git-filter-branch only work on files modified in a commit, then two things
  happen
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;you run into problems with deletions whenever the
  user is simply trying to rename files (because attempting to delete files that
  don&#x2019;t exist looks like a no-op; it takes some chicanery to remap
  deletes across file renames when the renames happen via arbitrary
  user-provided shell)</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;even if you succeed at the
  map-deletes-for-renames chicanery, you still technically violate backward
  compatibility because users are allowed to filter files in ways that depend
  upon topology of commits instead of filtering solely based on file contents or
  names (though this has not been observed in the wild).</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Even if you don&#x2019;t need to edit files but
  only want to e.g. rename or remove some and thus can avoid checking out each
  file (i.e. you can use --index-filter), you still are passing shell snippets
  for your filters. This means that for every commit, you have to have a
  prepared git repo where those filters can be run. That&#x2019;s a significant
  setup.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Further, several additional files are created or
  updated per commit by git-filter-branch. Some of these are for supporting the
  convenience functions provided by git-filter-branch (such as map()), while
  others are for keeping track of internal state (but could have also been
  accessed by user filters; one of git-filter-branch&#x2019;s regression tests
  does so). This essentially amounts to using the filesystem as an IPC mechanism
  between git-filter-branch and the user-provided filters. Disks tend to be a
  slow IPC mechanism, and writing these files also effectively represents a
  forced synchronization point between separate processes that we hit with every
  commit.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;The user-provided shell commands will likely
  involve a pipeline of commands, resulting in the creation of many processes
  per commit. Creating and running another process takes a widely varying amount
  of time between operating systems, but on any platform it is very slow
  relative to invoking a function.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;git-filter-branch itself is written in shell,
  which is kind of slow. This is the one performance issue that could be
  backward-compatibly fixed, but compared to the above problems that are
  intrinsic to the design of git-filter-branch, the language of the tool itself
  is a relatively minor issue.
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Side note: Unfortunately, people tend to fixate
  on the written-in-shell aspect and periodically ask if git-filter-branch could
  be rewritten in another language to fix the performance issues. Not only does
  that ignore the bigger intrinsic problems with the design, it&#x2019;d help
  less than you&#x2019;d expect: if git-filter-branch itself were not shell,
  then the convenience functions (map(), skip_commit(), etc) and the
  <b>--setup</b> argument could no longer be executed once at the beginning of
  the program but would instead need to be prepended to every user filter (and
  thus re-executed with every commit).</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The <b>git filter-repo</b>[1] tool is an alternative to
    git-filter-branch which does not suffer from these performance problems or
    the safety problems (mentioned below). For those with existing tooling which
    relies upon git-filter-branch, <i>git repo-filter</i> also provides
    <b>filter-lamely</b>[2], a drop-in git-filter-branch replacement (with a few
    caveats). While filter-lamely suffers from all the same safety issues as
    git-filter-branch, it at least ameloriates the performance issues a
  little.</p>

git-filter-branch is riddled with gotchas resulting in various ways to easily
  corrupt repos or end up with a mess worse than what you started with:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Someone can have a set of &quot;working and
  tested filters&quot; which they document or provide to a coworker, who then
  runs them on a different OS where the same commands are not working/tested
  (some examples in the git-filter-branch manpage are also affected by this).
  BSD vs. GNU userland differences can really bite. If lucky, error messages are
  spewed. But just as likely, the commands either don&#x2019;t do the filtering
  requested, or silently corrupt by making some unwanted change. The unwanted
  change may only affect a few commits, so it&#x2019;s not necessarily obvious
  either. (The fact that problems won&#x2019;t necessarily be obvious means they
  are likely to go unnoticed until the rewritten history is in use for quite a
  while, at which point it&#x2019;s really hard to justify another flag-day for
  another rewrite.)</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Filenames with spaces are often mishandled by
  shell snippets since they cause problems for shell pipelines. Not everyone is
  familiar with find -print0, xargs -0, git-ls-files -z, etc. Even people who
  are familiar with these may assume such flags are not relevant because someone
  else renamed any such files in their repo back before the person doing the
  filtering joined the project. And often, even those familiar with handling
  arguments with spaces may not do so just because they aren&#x2019;t in the
  mindset of thinking about everything that could possibly go wrong.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Non-ascii filenames can be silently removed
  despite being in a desired directory. Keeping only wanted paths is often done
  using pipelines like <b>git ls-files | grep -v ^WANTED_DIR/ | xargs git
  rm</b>. ls-files will only quote filenames if needed, so folks may not notice
  that one of the files didn&#x2019;t match the regex (at least not until
  it&#x2019;s much too late). Yes, someone who knows about core.quotePath can
  avoid this (unless they have other special characters like \t, \n, or &quot;),
  and people who use ls-files -z with something other than grep can avoid this,
  but that doesn&#x2019;t mean they will.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Similarly, when moving files around, one can find
  that filenames with non-ascii or special characters end up in a different
  directory, one that includes a double quote character. (This is technically
  the same issue as above with quoting, but perhaps an interesting different way
  that it can and has manifested as a problem.)</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;It&#x2019;s far too easy to accidentally mix up
  old and new history. It&#x2019;s still possible with any tool, but
  git-filter-branch almost invites it. If lucky, the only downside is users
  getting frustrated that they don&#x2019;t know how to shrink their repo and
  remove the old stuff. If unlucky, they merge old and new history and end up
  with multiple &quot;copies&quot; of each commit, some of which have unwanted
  or sensitive files and others which don&#x2019;t. This comes about in multiple
  different ways:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;the default to only doing a partial history
  rewrite (<i>--all</i> is not the default and few examples show it)</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;the fact that there&#x2019;s no automatic
  post-run cleanup</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;the fact that --tag-name-filter (when used to
  rename tags) doesn&#x2019;t remove the old tags but just adds new ones with
  the new name</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;the fact that little educational information is
  provided to inform users of the ramifications of a rewrite and how to avoid
  mixing old and new history. For example, this man page discusses how users
  need to understand that they need to rebase their changes for all their
  branches on top of new history (or delete and reclone), but that&#x2019;s only
  one of multiple concerns to consider. See the &quot;DISCUSSION&quot; section
  of the git filter-repo manual page for more details.</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Annotated tags can be accidentally converted to
  lightweight tags, due to either of two issues:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Someone can do a history rewrite, realize they
  messed up, restore from the backups in refs/original/, and then redo their
  git-filter-branch command. (The backup in refs/original/ is not a real backup;
  it dereferences tags first.)</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Running git-filter-branch with either --tags or
  --all in your &lt;rev-list options&gt;. In order to retain annotated tags as
  annotated, you must use --tag-name-filter (and must not have restored from
  refs/original/ in a previously botched rewrite).</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Any commit messages that specify an encoding will
  become corrupted by the rewrite; git-filter-branch ignores the encoding, takes
  the original bytes, and feeds it to commit-tree without telling it the proper
  encoding. (This happens whether or not --msg-filter is used.)</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Commit messages (even if they are all UTF-8) by
  default become corrupted due to not being updated &#x2014; any references to
  other commit hashes in commit messages will now refer to no-longer-extant
  commits.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;There are no facilities for helping users find
  what unwanted crud they should delete, which means they are much more likely
  to have incomplete or partial cleanups that sometimes result in confusion and
  people wasting time trying to understand. (For example, folks tend to just
  look for big files to delete instead of big directories or extensions, and
  once they do so, then sometime later folks using the new repository who are
  going through history will notice a build artifact directory that has some
  files but not others, or a cache of dependencies (node_modules or similar)
  which couldn&#x2019;t have ever been functional since it&#x2019;s missing some
  files.)</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;If --prune-empty isn&#x2019;t specified, then the
  filtering process can create hoards of confusing empty commits</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;If --prune-empty is specified, then intentionally
  placed empty commits from before the filtering operation are also pruned
  instead of just pruning commits that became empty due to filtering
  rules.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;If --prune empty is specified, sometimes empty
  commits are missed and left around anyway (a somewhat rare bug, but it
  happens...)</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;A minor issue, but users who have a goal to
  update all names and emails in a repository may be led to --env-filter which
  will only update authors and committers, missing taggers.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;If the user provides a --tag-name-filter that
  maps multiple tags to the same name, no warning or error is provided;
  git-filter-branch simply overwrites each tag in some undocumented pre-defined
  order resulting in only one tag at the end. (A git-filter-branch regression
  test requires this surprising behavior.)</div>
<p class="Pp">Also, the poor performance of git-filter-branch often leads to
    safety issues:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Coming up with the correct shell snippet to do
  the filtering you want is sometimes difficult unless you&#x2019;re just doing
  a trivial modification such as deleting a couple files. Unfortunately, people
  often learn if the snippet is right or wrong by trying it out, but the
  rightness or wrongness can vary depending on special circumstances (spaces in
  filenames, non-ascii filenames, funny author names or emails, invalid
  timezones, presence of grafts or replace objects, etc.), meaning they may have
  to wait a long time, hit an error, then restart. The performance of
  git-filter-branch is so bad that this cycle is painful, reducing the time
  available to carefully re-check (to say nothing about what it does to the
  patience of the person doing the rewrite even if they do technically have more
  time available). This problem is extra compounded because errors from broken
  filters may not be shown for a long time and/or get lost in a sea of output.
  Even worse, broken filters often just result in silent incorrect
  rewrites.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;To top it all off, even when users finally find
  working commands, they naturally want to share them. But they may be unaware
  that their repo didn&#x2019;t have some special cases that someone
  else&#x2019;s does. So, when someone else with a different repository runs the
  same commands, they get hit by the problems above. Or, the user just runs
  commands that really were vetted for special cases, but they run it on a
  different OS where it doesn&#x2019;t work, as noted above.</div>
