   Set up some character translations and predefined strings.  \*(-- will
   give an unbreakable dash, \*(PI will give pi, \*(L" will give a left
   double quote, and \*(R" will give a right double quote.  \*(C+ will
   give a nicer C++.  Capital omega is used to do unbreakable dashes and
   therefore won't be available.  \*(C` and \*(C' expand to `' in nroff,
   nothing in troff, for use with C<>.

List::MoreUtils::Contributing - Gives rough introduction into contributing to
  List::MoreUtils
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
List::Moreutils has a turbulent history and a strong approach. Before going
  further, please step to Open Source Contribution Etiquette
  &lt;http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2010/Dec-31.html&gt; and then come back.
<p class="Pp">The current distribution is a balance between finishing the
    history and claiming for future requirements. Therefore some components will
    receive a rewrite on purpose - others won't.</p>
<p class="Pp">For the moment - it's not the primary goal to clean up the
    configuration stage, until the primary goals and prerequisites are done.</p>
<p class="Pp">To contribute to List::MoreUtils, one has to arrange with the
    current situation, dig into details and ask for clarifying when parts are
    incomprehensible.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Primary_Goals"><a class="permalink" href="#Primary_Goals">Primary
  Goals</a></h2>
The very first primary goal is to clear the backlog. These are primarily the
  open issues, feature requests and missing infrastructure elements.
<p class="Pp">As example see RT#93207 or RT#75672 for missing configure time
    checks, while RT#93207 radiates until test - but doesn't affect runtime nor
    installation (beside test failures).</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Secondary_Goals"><a class="permalink" href="#Secondary_Goals">Secondary
  Goals</a></h2>
Secondary goals are harmonizing the function names and calling convention (see
  RT#102673), tidying the infrastructure of the distribution and remove
  unnecessary complexity (while protecting the necessary).
<p class="Pp">One example of removing unnecessary infrastructure could be to
    move Data::Tumbler and Test::WriteVariants into authoring mode, when
    improved test for RT#93207 could be reasonably done by a module which is
    recommended for test. The recommendation of Graham Knop's Makefile.PL#L82
    &lt;https://github.com/haarg/List-MoreUtils/blob/dd877f963deead742fc90005636c72c6be9060fc/Makefile.PL#L82&gt;
    in PR#9 &lt;https://github.com/perl5-utils/List-MoreUtils/pull/9&gt; a
    desirable one.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Orientation_Guide"><a class="permalink" href="#Orientation_Guide">Orientation
  Guide</a></h2>
List::MoreUtils configuration stage heavily depends on Config::AutoConf and
  Data::Tumbler. A few prerequisites of both modules aren't available for Perl
  5.6 - which leads to a tiny emulation layer t the begin of
  <span class="Li">&quot;Makefile.PL&quot;</span>.
<p class="Pp">The reason for Config::AutoConf is quite simple - the
    opportunities for checking the environment cover a much wider range than a
    simple test whether there is a working compiler. It requires a lot of
    improvements since its base ExtUtils::CBuilder was never designed to support
    that kind of solutions - but there is <i>Work In Progress</i>. To finally
    solve issues as RT#75672 even in cross-compile environments - there is no
    way around such a checking tool.</p>
<p class="Pp">The reason for Data::Tumbler in combination with
    Test::WriteVariants are extensible tests with reasonable effort and easy
    figuring out which extra condition causes failures. Also - missing
    pre-conditions should result in failing tests i some cases - what is fully
    supported by the logic behind Data::Tumbler in combination with
    Test::WriteVariants.</p>
<p class="Pp">Finally - inc::latest glues the stuff in a bundle together to
    allow people with older toolchains to use List::MoreUtils out of the box
    (maybe with reduced quantity but full quality).</p>
