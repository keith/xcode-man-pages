<p class="Pp"><i>unzip</i> will list, test, or extract files from a ZIP archive,
    commonly found on MS-DOS systems. The default behavior (with no options) is
    to extract into the current directory (and subdirectories below it) all
    files from the specified ZIP archive. A companion program, <i>zip</i>(1L),
    creates ZIP archives; both programs are compatible with archives created by
    PKWARE's <i>PKZIP</i> and <i>PKUNZIP</i> for MS-DOS, but in many cases the
    program options or default behaviors differ.</p>

  <dd>Path of the ZIP archive(s). If the file specification is a wildcard, each
      matching file is processed in an order determined by the operating system
      (or file system). Only the filename can be a wildcard; the path itself
      cannot. Wildcard expressions are similar to those supported in commonly
      used Unix shells (<i>sh</i>, <i>ksh</i>, <i>csh</i>) and may contain:</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>*</dt>
  <dd>matches a sequence of 0 or more characters</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>?</dt>
  <dd>matches exactly 1 character</dd>
  <dt>[...]</dt>
  <dd>matches any single character found inside the brackets; ranges are
      specified by a beginning character, a hyphen, and an ending character. If
      an exclamation point or a caret (`!' or `^') follows the left bracket,
      then the range of characters within the brackets is complemented (that is,
      anything <i>except</i> the characters inside the brackets is considered a
      match). To specify a verbatim left bracket, the three-character sequence
      ``[[]'' has to be used.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>(Be sure to quote any character that might otherwise be interpreted or
      modified by the operating system, particularly under Unix and VMS.) If no
      matches are found, the specification is assumed to be a literal filename;
      and if that also fails, the suffix .zip is appended. Note that
      self-extracting ZIP files are supported, as with any other ZIP archive;
      just specify the .exe suffix (if any) explicitly.</dd>
  <dt>[<i>file(s)</i>]</dt>
  <dd>An optional list of archive members to be processed, separated by spaces.
      (VMS versions compiled with VMSCLI defined must delimit files with commas
      instead. See <b>-v</b> in <b>OPTIONS</b> below.) Regular expressions
      (wildcards) may be used to match multiple members; see above. Again, be
      sure to quote expressions that would otherwise be expanded or modified by
      the operating system.</dd>
  <dt>[<b>-x</b>&#x00A0;<i>xfile(s)</i>]</dt>
  <dd>An optional list of archive members to be excluded from processing. Since
      wildcard characters normally match (`/') directory separators (for
      exceptions see the option <b>-W</b>), this option may be used to exclude
      any files that are in subdirectories. For example, ``unzip foo *.[ch] -x
      */*'' would extract all C source files in the main directory, but none in
      any subdirectories. Without the <b>-x</b> option, all C source files in
      all directories within the zipfile would be extracted.</dd>
  <dt>[<b>-d</b>&#x00A0;<i>exdir</i>]</dt>
  <dd>An optional directory to which to extract files. By default, all files and
      subdirectories are recreated in the current directory; the <b>-d</b>
      option allows extraction in an arbitrary directory (always assuming one
      has permission to write to the directory). This option need not appear at
      the end of the command line; it is also accepted before the zipfile
      specification (with the normal options), immediately after the zipfile
      specification, or between the <i>file(s)</i> and the <b>-x</b> option. The
      option and directory may be concatenated without any white space between
      them, but note that this may cause normal shell behavior to be suppressed.
      In particular, ``-d&#x00A0;~'' (tilde) is expanded by Unix C shells into
      the name of the user's home directory, but ``-d~'' is treated as a literal
      subdirectory ``<b>~</b>'' of the current directory.</dd>

  <dd>extract files to stdout/screen (``CRT''). This option is similar to the
      <b>-p</b> option except that the name of each file is printed as it is
      extracted, the <b>-a</b> option is allowed, and ASCII-EBCDIC conversion is
      automatically performed if appropriate. This option is not listed in the
      <i>unzip</i> usage screen.</dd>
  <dt id="f"><a class="permalink" href="#f"><b>-f</b></a></dt>
  <dd>freshen existing files, i.e., extract only those files that already exist
      on disk and that are newer than the disk copies. By default <i>unzip</i>
      queries before overwriting, but the <b>-o</b> option may be used to
      suppress the queries. Note that under many operating systems, the TZ
      (timezone) environment variable must be set correctly in order for
      <b>-f</b> and <b>-u</b> to work properly (under Unix the variable is
      usually set automatically). The reasons for this are somewhat subtle but
      have to do with the differences between DOS-format file times (always
      local time) and Unix-format times (always in GMT/UTC) and the necessity to
      compare the two. A typical TZ value is ``PST8PDT'' (US Pacific time with
      automatic adjustment for Daylight Savings Time or ``summer time'').</dd>
  <dt id="l"><a class="permalink" href="#l"><b>-l</b></a></dt>
  <dd>list archive files (short format). The names, uncompressed file sizes and
      modification dates and times of the specified files are printed, along
      with totals for all files specified. If UnZip was compiled with OS2_EAS
      defined, the <b>-l</b> option also lists columns for the sizes of stored
      OS/2 extended attributes (EAs) and OS/2 access control lists (ACLs). In
      addition, the zipfile comment and individual file comments (if any) are
      displayed. If a file was archived from a single-case file system (for
      example, the old MS-DOS FAT file system) and the <b>-L</b> option was
      given, the filename is converted to lowercase and is prefixed with a caret
      (^).</dd>
  <dt id="p"><a class="permalink" href="#p"><b>-p</b></a></dt>
  <dd>extract files to pipe (stdout). Nothing but the file data is sent to

      are stored (no conversions).</dd>
  <dt id="t"><a class="permalink" href="#t"><b>-t</b></a></dt>
  <dd>test archive files. This option extracts each specified file in memory and
      compares the CRC (cyclic redundancy check, an enhanced checksum) of the
      expanded file with the original file's stored CRC value.</dd>
  <dt id="T"><a class="permalink" href="#T"><b>-T</b></a></dt>
  <dd>[most OSes] set the timestamp on the archive(s) to that of the newest file
      in each one. This corresponds to <i>zip</i>'s <b>-go</b> option except
      that it can be used on wildcard zipfiles (e.g., ``unzip -T \*.zip'') and
      is much faster.</dd>
  <dt id="u"><a class="permalink" href="#u"><b>-u</b></a></dt>
  <dd>update existing files and create new ones if needed. This option performs
      the same function as the <b>-f</b> option, extracting (with query) files
      that are newer than those with the same name on disk, and in addition it
      extracts those files that do not already exist on disk. See <b>-f</b>
      above for information on setting the timezone properly.</dd>
  <dt id="v"><a class="permalink" href="#v"><b>-v</b></a></dt>
  <dd>list archive files (verbose format) or show diagnostic version info. This
      option has evolved and now behaves as both an option and a modifier. As an
      option it has two purposes: when a zipfile is specified with no other
      options, <b>-v</b> lists archive files verbosely, adding to the basic
      <b>-l</b> info the compression method, compressed size, compression ratio
      and 32-bit CRC. In contrast to most of the competing utilities,
      <i>unzip</i> removes the 12 additional header bytes of encrypted entries
      from the compressed size numbers. Therefore, compressed size and
      compression ratio figures are independent of the entry's encryption status
      and show the correct compression performance. (The complete size of the
      encrypted compressed data stream for zipfile entries is reported by the
      more verbose <i>zipinfo</i>(1L) reports, see the separate manual.) When no
      zipfile is specified (that is, the complete command is simply ``unzip
      -v''), a diagnostic screen is printed. In addition to the normal header
      with release date and version, <i>unzip</i> lists the home Info-ZIP ftp
      site and where to find a list of other ftp and non-ftp sites; the target
      operating system for which it was compiled, as well as (possibly) the
      hardware on which it was compiled, the compiler and version used, and the
      compilation date; any special compilation options that might affect the
      program's operation (see also <b>DECRYPTION</b> below); and any options
      stored in environment variables that might do the same (see <b>ENVIRONMENT
      OPTIONS</b> below). As a modifier it works in conjunction with other
      options (e.g., <b>-t</b>) to produce more verbose or debugging output;
      this is not yet fully implemented but will be in future releases.</dd>

  <dd>convert text files. Ordinarily all files are extracted exactly as they are
      stored (as ``binary'' files). The <b>-a</b> option causes files identified
      by <i>zip</i> as text files (those with the `t' label in <i>zipinfo</i>
      listings, rather than `b') to be automatically extracted as such,
      converting line endings, end-of-file characters and the character set
      itself as necessary. (For example, Unix files use line feeds (LFs) for
      end-of-line (EOL) and have no end-of-file (EOF) marker; Macintoshes use
      carriage returns (CRs) for EOLs; and most PC operating systems use CR+LF
      for EOLs and control-Z for EOF. In addition, IBM mainframes and the
      Michigan Terminal System use EBCDIC rather than the more common ASCII
      character set, and NT supports Unicode.) Note that <i>zip</i>'s
      identification of text files is by no means perfect; some ``text'' files
      may actually be binary and vice versa. <i>unzip</i> therefore prints
      ``[text]'' or ``[binary]'' as a visual check for each file it extracts
      when using the <b>-a</b> option. The <b>-aa</b> option forces all files to
      be extracted as text, regardless of the supposed file type. On VMS, see
      also <b>-S</b>.</dd>

  <dd>[VMS] auto-convert binary files (see <b>-a</b> above) to fixed-length,

      to be extracted in this format. When extracting to standard output
      (<b>-c</b> or <b>-p</b> option in effect), the default conversion of text
      record delimiters is disabled for binary (<b>-b</b>) resp. all
      (<b>-bb</b>) files.</dd>

  <dd>[when compiled with UNIXBACKUP defined] save a backup copy of each

      a tilde and optionally a unique sequence number (up to 5 digits) appended.
      The sequence number is applied whenever another file with the original
      name plus tilde already exists. When used together with the
      &quot;overwrite all&quot; option <b>-o</b>, numbered backup files are
      never created. In this case, all backup files are named as the original
      file with an appended tilde, existing backup files are deleted without
      notice. This feature works similarly to the default behavior of
      <i>emacs</i>(1) in many locations.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Example: the old copy of ``foo'' is renamed to ``foo~''.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Warning: Users should be aware that the <b>-B</b> option does not prevent
      loss of existing data under all circumstances. For example, when
      <i>unzip</i> is run in overwrite-all mode, an existing ``foo~'' file is
      deleted before <i>unzip</i> attempts to rename ``foo'' to ``foo~''. When
      this rename attempt fails (because of a file locks, insufficient
      privileges, or ...), the extraction of ``foo~'' gets cancelled, but the
      old backup file is already lost. A similar scenario takes place when the
      sequence number range for numbered backup files gets exhausted (99999, or
      65535 for 16-bit systems). In this case, the backup file with the maximum
      sequence number is deleted and replaced by the new backup version without
      notice.</dd>

  <dd>use case-insensitive matching for the selection of archive entries from
      the command-line list of extract selection patterns. <i>unzip</i>'s
      philosophy is ``you get what you ask for'' (this is also responsible for
      the <b>-L</b>/<b>-U</b> change; see the relevant options below). Because
      some file systems are fully case-sensitive (notably those under the Unix
      operating system) and because both ZIP archives and <i>unzip</i> itself
      are portable across platforms, <i>unzip</i>'s default behavior is to match
      both wildcard and literal filenames case-sensitively. That is, specifying
      ``makefile'' on the command line will <i>only</i> match ``makefile'' in
      the archive, not ``Makefile'' or ``MAKEFILE'' (and similarly for wildcard
      specifications). Since this does not correspond to the behavior of many
      other operating/file systems (for example, OS/2 HPFS, which preserves
      mixed case but is not sensitive to it), the <b>-C</b> option may be used
      to force all filename matches to be case-insensitive. In the example
      above, all three files would then match ``makefile'' (or ``make*'', or
      similar). The <b>-C</b> option affects file specs in both the normal file
      list and the excluded-file list (xlist).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Please note that the <b>-C</b> option does neither affect the search for
      the zipfile(s) nor the matching of archive entries to existing files on
      the extraction path. On a case-sensitive file system, <i>unzip</i> will
      never try to overwrite a file ``FOO'' when extracting an entry
    ``foo''!</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="D"><a class="permalink" href="#D"><b>-D</b></a></dt>
  <dd>skip restoration of timestamps for extracted items. Normally, <i>unzip</i>
      tries to restore all meta-information for extracted items that are
      supplied in the Zip archive (and do not require privileges or impose a
      security risk). By specifying <b>-D</b>, <i>unzip</i> is told to suppress
      restoration of timestamps for directories explicitly created from Zip
      archive entries. This option only applies to ports that support setting
      timestamps for directories (currently ATheOS, BeOS, MacOS, OS/2, Unix,
      VMS, Win32, for other <i>unzip</i> ports, <b>-D</b> has no effect). The
      duplicated option <b>-DD</b> forces suppression of timestamp restoration
      for all extracted entries (files and directories). This option results in
      setting the timestamps for all extracted entries to the current time.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>On VMS, the default setting for this option is <b>-D</b> for consistency
      with the behaviour of BACKUP: file timestamps are restored, timestamps of
      extracted directories are left at the current time. To enable restoration
      of directory timestamps, the negated option <b>--D</b> should be
      specified. On VMS, the option <b>-D</b> disables timestamp restoration for
      all extracted Zip archive items. (Here, a single <b>-D</b> on the command
      line combines with the default <b>-D</b> to do what an explicit <b>-DD</b>
      does on other systems.)</dd>

      in releases prior to 5.11; the new default behavior is identical to the
      old behavior with the <b>-U</b> option, which is now obsolete and will be
      removed in a future release.) Depending on the archiver, files archived
      under single-case file systems (VMS, old MS-DOS FAT, etc.) may be stored
      as all-uppercase names; this can be ugly or inconvenient when extracting
      to a case-preserving file system such as OS/2 HPFS or a case-sensitive one
      such as under Unix. By default <i>unzip</i> lists and extracts such
      filenames exactly as they're stored (excepting truncation, conversion of
      unsupported characters, etc.); this option causes the names of all files
      from certain systems to be converted to lowercase. The <b>-LL</b> option

      pressing the Enter (Return) key or the space bar. <i>unzip</i> can be
      terminated by pressing the ``q'' key and, on some systems, the
      Enter/Return key. Unlike Unix <i>more</i>(1), there is no
      forward-searching or editing capability. Also, <i>unzip</i> doesn't notice
      if long lines wrap at the edge of the screen, effectively resulting in the
      printing of two or more lines and the likelihood that some text will

  <dd>[all but Acorn, VM/CMS, MVS, Tandem] allows to extract archive members
      into locations outside of the current `` extraction root folder''. For
      security reasons, <i>unzip</i> normally removes ``parent dir'' path
      components (``../'') from the names of extracted file. This safety feature
      (new for version 5.50) prevents <i>unzip</i> from accidentally writing
      files to ``sensitive'' areas outside the active extraction folder tree
      head. The <b>-:</b> option lets <i>unzip</i> switch back to its previous,
      more liberal behaviour, to allow exact extraction of (older) archives that
      used ``../'' components to create multiple directory trees at the level of
      the current extraction folder. This option does not enable writing
      explicitly to the root directory (``/''). To achieve this, it is necessary
      to set the extraction target folder to root (e.g. <b>-d / </b>). However,
      when the <b>-:</b> option is specified, it is still possible to implicitly
      write to the root directory by specifying enough ``../'' path components

  <dd>[Unix only] allow control characters in names of extracted ZIP archive

      termination indicator), unless the specific file system has more
      restrictive conventions. Generally, this allows to embed ASCII control
      characters (or even sophisticated control sequences) in file names, at
      least on 'native' Unix file systems. However, it may be highly suspicious
      to make use of this Unix &quot;feature&quot;. Embedded control characters
      in file names might have nasty side effects when displayed on screen by
      some listing code without sufficient filtering. And, for ordinary users,
      it may be difficult to handle such file names (e.g. when trying to specify
      it for open, copy, move, or delete operations). Therefore, <i>unzip</i>
      applies a filter by default that removes potentially dangerous control
      characters from the extracted file names. The <b>-^</b> option allows to
      override this filter in the rare case that embedded filename control
      characters are to be intentionally restored.</dd>

<p class="Pp"><i>unzip</i>'s default behavior may be modified via options placed
    in an environment variable. This can be done with any option, but it is
    probably most useful with the <b>-a</b>, <b>-L</b>, <b>-C</b>, <b>-q</b>,
    <b>-o</b>, or <b>-n</b> modifiers: make <i>unzip</i> auto-convert text files
    by default, make it convert filenames from uppercase systems to lowercase,
    make it match names case-insensitively, make it quieter, or make it always
    overwrite or never overwrite files as it extracts them. For example, to make
    <i>unzip</i> act as quietly as possible, only reporting errors, one would
    use one of the following commands:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="Unix"><a class="permalink" href="#Unix">
  <br/>
   Unix Bourne shell:</a></dt>
  <dd>UNZIP=-qq; export UNZIP</dd>

  <dd>define UNZIP_OPTS &quot;-qq&quot;</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Environment options are, in effect, considered to be just like any
    other command-line options, except that they are effectively the first
    options on the command line. To override an environment option, one may use
    the ``minus operator'' to remove it. For instance, to override one of the
    quiet-flags in the example above, use the command</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>unzip --q[<i>other options</i>] zipfile
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The first hyphen is the normal switch character, and the second is
    a minus sign, acting on the q option. Thus the effect here is to cancel one
    quantum of quietness. To cancel both quiet flags, two (or more) minuses may
    be used:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>unzip -t--q zipfile
unzip ---qt zipfile
</pre>
<p class="Pp">(the two are equivalent). This may seem awkward or confusing, but
    it is reasonably intuitive: just ignore the first hyphen and go from there.
    It is also consistent with the behavior of Unix <i>nice</i>(1).</p>
<p class="Pp">As suggested by the examples above, the default variable names are
    UNZIP_OPTS for VMS (where the symbol used to install <i>unzip</i> as a
    foreign command would otherwise be confused with the environment variable),
    and UNZIP for all other operating systems. For compatibility with
    <i>zip</i>(1L), UNZIPOPT is also accepted (don't ask). If both UNZIP and
    UNZIPOPT are defined, however, UNZIP takes precedence. <i>unzip</i>'s
    diagnostic option (<b>-v</b> with no zipfile name) can be used to check the
    values of all four possible <i>unzip</i> and <i>zipinfo</i> environment
    variables.</p>
<p class="Pp">The timezone variable (TZ) should be set according to the local
    timezone in order for the <b>-f</b> and <b>-u</b> to operate correctly. See
    the description of <b>-f</b> above for details. This variable may also be
    necessary to get timestamps of extracted files to be set correctly. The
    WIN32 (Win9x/ME/NT4/2K/XP/2K3) port of <i>unzip</i> gets the timezone
    configuration from the registry, assuming it is correctly set in the Control
    Panel. The TZ variable is ignored for this port.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="DECRYPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DECRYPTION">DECRYPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Encrypted archives are fully supported by Info-ZIP software, but
    due to United States export restrictions, de-/encryption support might be
    disabled in your compiled binary. However, since spring 2000, US export
    restrictions have been liberated, and our source archives do now include
    full crypt code. In case you need binary distributions with crypt support
    enabled, see the file ``WHERE'' in any Info-ZIP source or binary
    distribution for locations both inside and outside the US.</p>
<p class="Pp">Some compiled versions of <i>unzip</i> may not support decryption.
    To check a version for crypt support, either attempt to test or extract an
    encrypted archive, or else check <i>unzip</i>'s diagnostic screen (see the
    <b>-v</b> option above) for ``[decryption]'' as one of the special
    compilation options.</p>
<p class="Pp">As noted above, the <b>-P</b> option may be used to supply a
    password on the command line, but at a cost in security. The preferred
    decryption method is simply to extract normally; if a zipfile member is
    encrypted, <i>unzip</i> will prompt for the password without echoing what is
    typed. <i>unzip</i> continues to use the same password as long as it appears
    to be valid, by testing a 12-byte header on each file. The correct password
    will always check out against the header, but there is a 1-in-256 chance
    that an incorrect password will as well. (This is a security feature of the
    PKWARE zipfile format; it helps prevent brute-force attacks that might
    otherwise gain a large speed advantage by testing only the header.) In the
    case that an incorrect password is given but it passes the header test
    anyway, either an incorrect CRC will be generated for the extracted data or
    else <i>unzip</i> will fail during the extraction because the ``decrypted''
    bytes do not constitute a valid compressed data stream.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the first password fails the header check on some file,
    <i>unzip</i> will prompt for another password, and so on until all files are
    extracted. If a password is not known, entering a null password (that is,
    just a carriage return or ``Enter'') is taken as a signal to skip all
    further prompting. Only unencrypted files in the archive(s) will thereafter
    be extracted. (In fact, that's not quite true; older versions of
    <i>zip</i>(1L) and <i>zipcloak</i>(1L) allowed null passwords, so
    <i>unzip</i> checks each encrypted file to see if the null password works.
    This may result in ``false positives'' and extraction errors, as noted
    above.)</p>
<p class="Pp">Archives encrypted with 8-bit passwords (for example, passwords
    with accented European characters) may not be portable across systems and/or
    other archivers. This problem stems from the use of multiple encoding
    methods for such characters, including Latin-1 (ISO 8859-1) and OEM code
    page 850. DOS <i>PKZIP</i> 2.04g uses the OEM code page; Windows
    <i>PKZIP</i> 2.50 uses Latin-1 (and is therefore incompatible with DOS
    <i>PKZIP</i>); Info-ZIP uses the OEM code page on DOS, OS/2 and Win3.x ports
    but ISO coding (Latin-1 etc.) everywhere else; and Nico Mak's <i>WinZip</i>
    6.x does not allow 8-bit passwords at all. <i>UnZip</i> 5.3 (or newer)
    attempts to use the default character set first (e.g., Latin-1), followed by
    the alternate one (e.g., OEM code page) to test passwords. On EBCDIC
    systems, if both of these fail, EBCDIC encoding will be tested as a last
    resort. (EBCDIC is not tested on non-EBCDIC systems, because there are no
    known archivers that encrypt using EBCDIC encoding.) ISO character encodings
    other than Latin-1 are not supported. The new addition of (partially)
    Unicode (resp. UTF-8) support in <i>UnZip</i> 6.0 has not yet been adapted
    to the encryption password handling in <i>unzip</i>. On systems that use
    UTF-8 as native character encoding, <i>unzip</i> simply tries decryption
    with the native UTF-8 encoded password; the built-in attempts to check the
    password in translated encoding have not yet been adapted for UTF-8 support
    and will consequently fail.</p>

    scarier-looking things, so <i>unzip</i> instead maps them into VMS-style
    status codes. The current mapping is as follows: 1 (success) for normal
    exit, 0x7fff0001 for warning errors, and (0x7fff000? +
    16*normal_unzip_exit_status) for all other errors, where the `?' is 2
    (error) for <i>unzip</i> values 2, 9-11 and 80-82, and 4 (fatal error) for
    the remaining ones (3-8, 50, 51). In addition, there is a compilation option
    to expand upon this behavior: defining RETURN_CODES results in a
    human-readable explanation of what the error status means.</p>

<p class="Pp">Multi-part archives are not yet supported, except in conjunction
    with <i>zip</i>. (All parts must be concatenated together in order, and then
    ``zip -F'' (for <i>zip 2.x</i>) or ``zip -FF'' (for <i>zip 3.x</i>) must be
    performed on the concatenated archive in order to ``fix'' it. Also, <i>zip
    3.0</i> and later can combine multi-part (split) archives into a combined
    single-file archive using ``zip -s- inarchive -O outarchive''. See the
    <i>zip 3</i> manual page for more information.) This will definitely be
    corrected in the next major release.</p>
<p class="Pp">Archives read from standard input are not yet supported, except
    with <i>funzip</i> (and then only the first member of the archive can be
    extracted).</p>
<p class="Pp">Archives encrypted with 8-bit passwords (e.g., passwords with
    accented European characters) may not be portable across systems and/or
    other archivers. See the discussion in <b>DECRYPTION</b> above.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>unzip</i>'s <b>-M</b> (``more'') option tries to take into
    account automatic wrapping of long lines. However, the code may fail to
    detect the correct wrapping locations. First, TAB characters (and similar
    control sequences) are not taken into account, they are handled as ordinary
    printable characters. Second, depending on the actual system / OS port,
    <i>unzip</i> may not detect the true screen geometry but rather rely on
    &quot;commonly used&quot; default dimensions. The correct handling of tabs
    would require the implementation of a query for the actual tabulator setup
    on the output console.</p>
<p class="Pp">Dates, times and permissions of stored directories are not
    restored except under Unix. (On Windows NT and successors, timestamps are
    now restored.)</p>
<p class="Pp">[MS-DOS] When extracting or testing files from an archive on a
    defective floppy diskette, if the ``Fail'' option is chosen from DOS's
    ``Abort, Retry, Fail?'' message, older versions of <i>unzip</i> may hang the
    system, requiring a reboot. This problem appears to be fixed, but control-C
    (or control-Break) can still be used to terminate <i>unzip</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Under DEC Ultrix, <i>unzip</i> would sometimes fail on long
    zipfiles (bad CRC, not always reproducible). This was apparently due either
    to a hardware bug (cache memory) or an operating system bug (improper
    handling of page faults?). Since Ultrix has been abandoned in favor of
    Digital Unix (OSF/1), this may not be an issue anymore.</p>
<p class="Pp">[Unix] Unix special files such as FIFO buffers (named pipes),
    block devices and character devices are not restored even if they are
    somehow represented in the zipfile, nor are hard-linked files relinked.
    Basically the only file types restored by <i>unzip</i> are regular files,
    directories and symbolic (soft) links.</p>
<p class="Pp">[OS/2] Extended attributes for existing directories are only
    updated if the <b>-o</b> (``overwrite all'') option is given. This is a
    limitation of the operating system; because directories only have a creation
    time associated with them, <i>unzip</i> has no way to determine whether the
    stored attributes are newer or older than those on disk. In practice this
    may mean a two-pass approach is required: first unpack the archive normally
    (with or without freshening/updating existing files), then overwrite just
    the directory entries (e.g., ``unzip -o foo */'').</p>
<p class="Pp">[VMS] When extracting to another directory, only the <i>[.foo]</i>
    syntax is accepted for the <b>-d</b> option; the simple Unix <i>foo</i>
    syntax is silently ignored (as is the less common VMS <i>foo.dir</i>
    syntax).</p>
<p class="Pp">[VMS] When the file being extracted already exists, <i>unzip</i>'s
    query only allows skipping, overwriting or renaming; there should
    additionally be a choice for creating a new version of the file. In fact,
    the ``overwrite'' choice does create a new version; the old version is not
    overwritten or deleted.</p>

<p class="Pp">The following people were former members of the Info-ZIP
    development group and provided major contributions to key parts of the
    current code: Greg ``Cave Newt'' Roelofs (UnZip, unshrink decompression);
    Jean-loup Gailly (deflate compression); Mark Adler (inflate decompression,
    fUnZip).</p>
<p class="Pp">The author of the original unzip code upon which Info-ZIP's was
    based is Samuel H. Smith; Carl Mascott did the first Unix port; and David P.
    Kirschbaum organized and led Info-ZIP in its early days with Keith Petersen
    hosting the original mailing list at WSMR-SimTel20. The full list of
    contributors to UnZip has grown quite large; please refer to the CONTRIBS
    file in the UnZip source distribution for a relatively complete version.</p>
