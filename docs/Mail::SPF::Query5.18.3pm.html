<p class="Pp">The SPF protocol relies on sender domains to describe their
    designated outbound mailers in DNS. Given an email address, Mail::SPF::Query
    determines the legitimacy of an SMTP client IP address.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">There are two ways to use Mail::SPF::Query. Your choice depends on
    whether the domains your server is an MX for have secondary MXes which your
    server doesn't know about.</p>
<p class="Pp">The first and more common style, calling -&gt;<i>result()</i>, is
    suitable when all mail is received directly from the originator's MTA. If
    the domains you receive do not have secondary MX entries, this is
    appropriate. This style of use is outlined in the SYNOPSIS above. This is
    the common case.</p>
<p class="Pp">The second style is more complex, but works when your server
    receives mail from secondary MXes. This performs checks as each recipient is
    handled. If the message is coming from a valid MX secondary for a recipient,
    then the SPF check is not performed, and a &quot;pass&quot; response is
    returned right away. To do this, call
    <span class="Li">&quot;result2()&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;message_result2()&quot;</span> instead of
    <span class="Li">&quot;result()&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you do not know what a secondary MX is, you probably don't have
    one. Use the first style.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can try out Mail::SPF::Query on the command line with the
    following command:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    perl -MMail::SPF::Query -le 'print for Mail::SPF::Query-&gt;new(
        helo =&gt; shift, ipv4 =&gt; shift, sender =&gt; shift)-&gt;result' \
        helohost.example.com 1.2.3.4 user@example.com

<h1 class="Sh" id="BUGS"><a class="permalink" href="#BUGS">BUGS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Mail::SPF::Query tries to implement the SPF specification (see
    &quot;SEE ALSO&quot;) as close as reasonably possible given that M:S:Q has
    been the very first SPF implementation and has changed with the SPF
    specification over time. As a result, M:S:Q has various known deficiencies
    that cannot be corrected with reasonably little effort:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li><b>Unable to query HELO and MAIL FROM separately.</b> M:S:Q is not
      designed to support the <i>separate</i> querying of the HELO and MAIL FROM
      identities. Passing the HELO identity as the
      <span class="Li">&quot;sender&quot;</span> argument for a stand-alone HELO
      check might generally work but could yield unexpected results.</li>
  <li><b>No IPv6 support.</b> IPv6 is not supported.
      <span class="Li">&quot;ip6&quot;</span> mechanisms in SPF records and
      everywhere else are simply ignored.</li>
  <li><b>Result explanation may be inappropriate for local policy results.</b>
      If a query result was caused by anything other than a real SPF record
      (i.e. local policy, overrides, fallbacks, etc.), and no custom
      <span class="Li">&quot;default_explanation&quot;</span> was specified, the
      domain's explanation or M:S:Q's hard-coded default explanation will still
      be returned. Be aware that in this case the explanation may not correctly
      explain the reason for such an artificial result.</li>

<h1 class="Sh" id="NON-STANDARD_FEATURES"><a class="permalink" href="#NON-STANDARD_FEATURES">NON-STANDARD
  FEATURES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Also due to its long history, M:S:Q does have some legacy features
    that are not parts of the official SPF specification, most notably <i>best
    guess processing</i> and <i>trusted forwarder accreditation checking</i>.
    Please be careful when using these <i>non-standard</i> features or when
    reproducing them in your own SPF implementation, as they may cause
    unexpected results.</p>

<p class="Pp">Note that the strings returned by this method (and most of the

    sure that (by default) the strings returned contain only characters in the

<p class="Pp">Subclasses may override this with their own debug logger.
    <span class="Li">&quot;Log::Dispatch&quot;</span> is recommended.</p>
<p class="Pp">Alternatively, pass the <span class="Li">&quot;new()&quot;</span>
    constructor a <span class="Li">&quot;debuglog =&gt; sub { ... }&quot;</span>
    callback, and we'll pass debugging lines to that.</p>

<p class="Pp">Mail::Query::SPF should only be used at the point where messages
    are received from the Internet. The underlying assumption is that the sender
    of the e-mail is sending the message directly to you or one of your
    secondary MXes. If your MTA does not have an exhaustive list of secondary
    MXes, then the <span class="Li">&quot;result2()&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;message_result2()&quot;</span> methods can be used.
    These methods take care to permit mail from secondary MXes.</p>
