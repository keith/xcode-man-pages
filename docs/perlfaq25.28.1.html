   double quote, and \*(R" will give a right double quote.  \*(C+ will
   give a nicer C++.  Capital omega is used to do unbreakable dashes and

This section of the FAQ answers questions about where to find source and
  documentation for Perl, support, and related matters.

  machines support Perl? Where do I get it?</a></h2>
The standard release of Perl (the one maintained by the Perl development team)
  is distributed only in source code form. You can find the latest releases at
  &lt;http://www.cpan.org/src/&gt;.
<p class="Pp">Perl builds and runs on a bewildering number of platforms.
    Virtually all known and current Unix derivatives are supported (perl's
    native platform), as are other systems like VMS, DOS, OS/2, Windows, QNX,
    BeOS, OS X, MPE/iX and the Amiga.</p>
<p class="Pp">Binary distributions for some proprietary platforms can be found
    &lt;http://www.cpan.org/ports/&gt; directory. Because these are not part of
    the standard distribution, they may and in fact do differ from the base perl
    port in a variety of ways. You'll have to check their respective release
    notes to see just what the differences are. These differences can be either
    positive (e.g. extensions for the features of the particular platform that
    are not supported in the source release of perl) or negative (e.g. might be
    based upon a less current source release of perl).</p>

  don't have a C compiler. How can I build my own Perl interpreter?</a></h2>
For Windows, use a binary version of Perl, Strawberry Perl
  &lt;http://strawberryperl.com/&gt; and ActivePerl
  &lt;http://www.activestate.com/activeperl&gt; come with a bundled C compiler.
<p class="Pp">Otherwise if you really do want to build Perl, you need to get a
    binary version of <span class="Li">&quot;gcc&quot;</span> for your system
    first. Use a search engine to find out how to do this for your operating
    system.</p>

  copied the Perl binary from one machine to another, but scripts don't
  work.</a></h2>
That's probably because you forgot libraries, or library paths differ. You
  really should build the whole distribution on the machine it will eventually
  live on, and then type <span class="Li">&quot;make install&quot;</span>. Most
  other approaches are doomed to failure.
<p class="Pp">One simple way to check that things are in the right place is to
    print out the hard-coded <span class="Li">@INC</span> that perl looks
    through for libraries:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    % perl -le 'print for @INC'
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If this command lists any paths that don't exist on your system,
    then you may need to move the appropriate libraries to these locations, or
    create symbolic links, aliases, or shortcuts appropriately.
    <span class="Li">@INC</span> is also printed as part of the output of</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    % perl -V
</pre>
<p class="Pp">You might also want to check out &quot;How do I keep my own
    module/library directory?&quot; in perlfaq8.</p>

Read the <i>INSTALL</i> file, which is part of the source distribution. It
  describes in detail how to cope with most idiosyncrasies that the
  <span class="Li">&quot;Configure&quot;</span> script can't work around for any
  given system or architecture.

  modules and extensions are available for Perl? What is CPAN?</a></h2>
CPAN stands for Comprehensive Perl Archive Network, a multi-gigabyte archive
  replicated on hundreds of machines all over the world. CPAN contains tens of
  thousands of modules and extensions, source code and documentation, designed
  for <i>everything</i> from commercial database interfaces to keyboard/screen
  control and running large web sites.
<p class="Pp">You can search CPAN on &lt;http://metacpan.org&gt; or
    &lt;http://search.cpan.org/&gt;.</p>
<p class="Pp">The master web site for CPAN is &lt;http://www.cpan.org/&gt;,
    &lt;http://www.cpan.org/SITES.html&gt; lists all mirrors.</p>
<p class="Pp">See the CPAN FAQ at &lt;http://www.cpan.org/misc/cpan-faq.html&gt;
    for answers to the most frequently asked questions about CPAN.</p>
<p class="Pp">The Task::Kensho module has a list of recommended modules which
    you should review as a good starting point.</p>

  <li>&lt;http://learn.perl.org/&gt;</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">The complete Perl documentation is available with the Perl
    distribution. If you have Perl installed locally, you probably have the
    documentation installed as well: type <span class="Li">&quot;perldoc
    perl&quot;</span> in a terminal or view online
    &lt;http://perldoc.perl.org/perl.html&gt;.</p>
<p class="Pp">(Some operating system distributions may ship the documentation in
    a different package; for instance, on Debian, you need to install the
    <span class="Li">&quot;perl-doc&quot;</span> package.)</p>
<p class="Pp">Many good books have been written about Perl--see the section

Perl.com &lt;http://www.perl.com/&gt; used to be part of the O'Reilly Network, a
  subsidiary of O'Reilly Media. Although it retains most of the original content
  from its O'Reilly Network, it is now hosted by The Perl Foundation
  &lt;http://www.perlfoundation.org/&gt;.
<p class="Pp">The Perl Foundation is an advocacy organization for the Perl
    language which maintains the web site &lt;http://www.perl.org/&gt; as a
    general advocacy site for the Perl language. It uses the domain to provide
    general support services to the Perl community, including the hosting of
    mailing lists, web sites, and other services. There are also many other
    sub-domains for special topics like learning Perl and jobs in Perl, such
  as:</p>

</ul>
<p class="Pp">Perl Mongers &lt;http://www.pm.org/&gt; uses the pm.org domain for
    services related to local Perl user groups, including the hosting of mailing
    lists and web sites. See the Perl Mongers web site
    &lt;http://www.pm.org/&gt; for more information about joining, starting, or
    requesting services for a Perl user group.</p>

Perl already <i>is</i> commercial software: it has a license that you can grab
  and carefully read to your manager. It is distributed in releases and comes in
  well-defined packages. There is a very large and supportive user community and
  an extensive literature.
<p class="Pp">If you still need commercial support ActiveState
    &lt;http://www.activestate.com/activeperl&gt; offers this.</p>

(contributed by brian d foy)
<p class="Pp">First, ensure that you've found an actual bug. Second, ensure
    you've found an actual bug.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you've found a bug with the perl interpreter or one of the
    modules in the standard library (those that come with Perl), you can use the
    perlbug utility that comes with Perl (&gt;= 5.004). It collects information
    about your installation to include with your message, then sends the message
    to the right place.</p>
<p class="Pp">To determine if a module came with your version of Perl, you can
    install and use the Module::CoreList module. It has the information about
    the modules (with their versions) included with each release of Perl.</p>
<p class="Pp">Every CPAN module has a bug tracker set up in RT,
    &lt;http://rt.cpan.org&gt;. You can submit bugs to RT either through its web
    interface or by email. To email a bug report, send it to
    bug-&lt;distribution-name&gt;@rt.cpan.org . For example, if you wanted to
    report a bug in Business::ISBN, you could send a message to
    bug-Business-ISBN@rt.cpan.org .</p>
<p class="Pp">Some modules might have special reporting requirements, such as a
    Github or Google Code tracking system, so you should check the module
    documentation too.</p>
