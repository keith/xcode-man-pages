<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">This is where gotchas and breakages related to the Test2 upgrade
    are documented. The upgrade causes Test::Builder to defer to Test2 under the
    hood. This transition is mostly transparent, but there are a few cases that
    can trip you up.</p>

  internals.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Test::Builder1.5/2_conditionals"><a class="permalink" href="#Test::Builder1.5/2_conditionals">Test::Builder1.5/2
  conditionals</a></h2>
<p class="Pp"><i>The Problem</i></p>
<p class="Pp">a few years back there were two attempts to upgrade/replace
    Test::Builder. Confusingly these were called Test::Builder2 and
    Test::Builder1.5, in that order. Many people put conditionals in their code
    to check the Test::Builder version number and adapt their code
  accordingly.</p>
<p class="Pp">The Test::Builder2/1.5 projects both died out. Now the conditional
    code people added has become a mine field. A vast majority of modules broken
    by Test2 fall into this category.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>The Fix</i></p>
<p class="Pp">The fix is to remove all Test::Builder1.5/2 related code. Either
    use the legacy Test::Builder API, or use Test2 directly.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Replacing_the_Test::Builder_singleton"><a class="permalink" href="#Replacing_the_Test::Builder_singleton">Replacing
  the Test::Builder singleton</a></h2>
<p class="Pp"><i>The Problem</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Some test modules would replace the Test::Builder singleton
    instance with their own instance or subclass. This was usually done to
    intercept or modify results as they happened.</p>
<p class="Pp">The Test::Builder singleton is now a simple compatibility wrapper
    around Test2. The Test::Builder singleton is no longer the central place for
    results. Many results bypass the Test::Builder singleton completely, which
    breaks and behavior intended when replacing the singleton.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>The Fix</i></p>
<p class="Pp">If you simply want to intercept all results instead of letting
    them go to TAP, you should look at the Test2::API docs and read about
    pushing a new hub onto the hub stack. Replacing the hub temporarily is now
    the correct way to intercept results.</p>
<p class="Pp">If your goal is purely monitoring of events use the
    <span class="Li">&quot;Test2::Hub-&gt;listen()&quot;</span> method exported
    by Test::More to watch events as they are fired. If you wish to modify
    results before they go to TAP look at the
    <span class="Li">&quot;Test2::Hub-&gt;filter()&quot;</span> method.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Directly_Accessing_Hash_Elements"><a class="permalink" href="#Directly_Accessing_Hash_Elements">Directly
  Accessing Hash Elements</a></h2>
<p class="Pp"><i>The Problem</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Some modules look directly at hash keys on the Test::Builder
    singleton. The problem here is that the Test::Builder singleton no longer
    holds anything important.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>The Fix</i></p>
<p class="Pp">The fix is to use the API specified in Test2::API to look at or
    modify state as needed.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Subtest_indentation"><a class="permalink" href="#Subtest_indentation">Subtest
  indentation</a></h2>
<p class="Pp"><i>The Problem</i></p>
<p class="Pp">An early change, in fact the change that made Test2 an idea, was a
    change to the indentation of the subtest note. IT was decided it would be
    more readable to outdent the subtest note instead of having it inline with
    the subtest:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    # subtest foo
        ok 1 - blah
        1..1
    ok 1 - subtest foo
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The old style indented the note:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        # subtest foo
        ok 1 - blah
        1..1
    ok 1 - subtest foo
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This breaks tests that do string comparison of TAP output.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>The Fix</i></p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    my $indent = $INC{'Test2/API.pm'} ? '' : '    ';
    is(
        $subtest_output,
        &quot;${indent}# subtest foo&quot;,
        &quot;Got subtest note&quot;
    );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Check if <span class="Li">$INC{'Test2/API.pm'}</span> is set, if
    it is then no indentation should be expected. If it is not set than the old
    Test::Builder is in use, indentation should be expected.</p>

      The bug appears to have been fixed by Test2, which means the workaround
      causes a failure. This can be easily updated, but nobody has done so yet.

      latest version on CPAN will install just fine. Upgrading is not required,

  <dt id="autouse"><a class="permalink" href="#autouse">autouse</a></dt>
