    NOTE: beginning in Net::Server 2.005, the default value for
          ipv is IPv* meaning that if no host is passed, or
          a hostname is past, any available IPv4 and IPv6 sockets will be
          bound.  You can force IPv4 only by adding an ipv =&gt; 4
          configuration in any of the half dozen ways we let you
          specify it.

<span class="Li">&quot;Net::Server&quot;</span> is an extensible, generic Perl
  server engine.
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;Net::Server&quot;</span> attempts to be a
    generic server as in <span class="Li">&quot;Net::Daemon&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;NetServer::Generic&quot;</span>. It includes with it
    the ability to run as an inetd process
    (<span class="Li">&quot;Net::Server::INET&quot;</span>), a single connection
    server (<span class="Li">&quot;Net::Server&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;Net::Server::Single&quot;</span>), a forking server
    (<span class="Li">&quot;Net::Server::Fork&quot;</span>), a preforking server
    which maintains a constant number of preforked children
    (<span class="Li">&quot;Net::Server::PreForkSimple&quot;</span>), or as a
    managed preforking server which maintains the number of children based on
    server load (<span class="Li">&quot;Net::Server::PreFork&quot;</span>). In
    all but the inetd type, the server provides the ability to connect to one or
    to multiple server ports.</p>
<p class="Pp">The additional server types are made possible via
    &quot;personalities&quot; or sub classes of the
    <span class="Li">&quot;Net::Server&quot;</span>. By moving the multiple
    types of servers out of the main
    <span class="Li">&quot;Net::Server&quot;</span> class, the
    <span class="Li">&quot;Net::Server&quot;</span> concept is easily extended
    to other types (in the near future, we would like to add a
    &quot;Thread&quot; personality).</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;Net::Server&quot;</span> borrows several
    concepts from the Apache Webserver.
    <span class="Li">&quot;Net::Server&quot;</span> uses &quot;hooks&quot; to
    allow custom servers such as SMTP, HTTP, POP3, etc. to be layered over the
    base <span class="Li">&quot;Net::Server&quot;</span> class. In addition the
    <span class="Li">&quot;Net::Server::PreFork&quot;</span> class borrows
    concepts of min_start_servers, max_servers, and min_waiting servers.
    <span class="Li">&quot;Net::Server::PreFork&quot;</span> also uses the
    concept of an flock serialized accept when accepting on multiple ports
    (PreFork can choose between flock, IPC::Semaphore, and pipe to control
    serialization).</p>
</section>

<h1 class="Sh" id="PERSONALITIES"><a class="permalink" href="#PERSONALITIES">PERSONALITIES</a></h1>
<span class="Li">&quot;Net::Server&quot;</span> is built around a common class
  (Net::Server) and is extended using sub classes, or
  <span class="Li">&quot;personalities&quot;</span>. Each personality inherits,
  overrides, or enhances the base methods of the base class.
<p class="Pp">Included with the Net::Server package are several basic
    personalities, each of which has their own use.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>Fork</dt>
  <dd>Found in the module Net/Server/Fork.pm (see Net::Server::Fork). This
      server binds to one or more ports and then waits for a connection. When a
      client request is received, the parent forks a child, which then handles
      the client and exits. This is good for moderately hit services.</dd>
  <dt>INET</dt>
  <dd>Found in the module Net/Server/INET.pm (see Net::Server::INET). This
      server is designed to be used with inetd. The
      <span class="Li">&quot;pre_bind&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;bind&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;accept&quot;</span>, and
      <span class="Li">&quot;post_accept&quot;</span> are all overridden as
      these services are taken care of by the INET daemon.</dd>
  <dt>MultiType</dt>
  <dd>Found in the module Net/Server/MultiType.pm (see Net::Server::MultiType).
      This server has no server functionality of its own. It is designed for
      servers which need a simple way to easily switch between different
      personalities. Multiple <span class="Li">&quot;server_type&quot;</span>
      parameters may be given and Net::Server::MultiType will cycle through
      until it finds a class that it can use.</dd>
  <dt>Multiplex</dt>
  <dd>Found in the module Net/Server/Multiplex.pm (see Net::Server::Multiplex).
      This server binds to one or more ports. It uses IO::Multiplex to multiplex
      between waiting for new connections and waiting for input on currently
      established connections. This personality is designed to run as one
      process without forking. The
      <span class="Li">&quot;process_request&quot;</span> method is never used
      but the <span class="Li">&quot;mux_input&quot;</span> callback is used
      instead (see also IO::Multiplex). See examples/samplechat.pl for an
      example using most of the features of Net::Server::Multiplex.</dd>
  <dt>PreForkSimple</dt>
  <dd>Found in the module Net/Server/PreFork.pm (see Net::Server::PreFork). This
      server binds to one or more ports and then forks
      <span class="Li">&quot;max_servers&quot;</span> child process. The server
      will make sure that at any given time there are always
      <span class="Li">&quot;max_servers&quot;</span> available to receive a
      client request. Each of these children will process up to
      <span class="Li">&quot;max_requests&quot;</span> client connections. This
      type is good for a heavily hit site that can dedicate max_server processes
      no matter what the load. It should scale well for most applications. Multi
      port accept is accomplished using either flock, IPC::Semaphore, or pipe to
      serialize the children. Serialization may also be switched on for single
      port in order to get around an OS that does not allow multiple children to
      accept at the same time. For a further discussion of serialization see
      Net::Server::PreFork.</dd>
  <dt>PreFork</dt>
  <dd>Found in the module Net/Server/PreFork.pm (see Net::Server::PreFork). This
      server binds to one or more ports and then forks
      <span class="Li">&quot;min_servers&quot;</span> child process. The server
      will make sure that at any given time there are at least
      <span class="Li">&quot;min_spare_servers&quot;</span> but not more than
      <span class="Li">&quot;max_spare_servers&quot;</span> available to receive
      a client request, up to <span class="Li">&quot;max_servers&quot;</span>.
      Each of these children will process up to
      <span class="Li">&quot;max_requests&quot;</span> client connections. This
      type is good for a heavily hit site, and should scale well for most
      applications. Multi port accept is accomplished using either flock,
      IPC::Semaphore, or pipe to serialize the children. Serialization may also
      be switched on for single port in order to get around an OS that does not
      allow multiple children to accept at the same time. For a further
      discussion of serialization see Net::Server::PreFork.</dd>
  <dt>Single</dt>
  <dd>All methods fall back to Net::Server. This personality is provided only as
      parallelism for Net::Server::MultiType.</dd>
  <dt>HTTP</dt>
  <dd>Not a distinct personality. Provides a basic HTTP daemon. This can be
      combined with the SSL or SSLEAY proto to provide an HTTPS Daemon. See
      Net::Server::HTTP.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;Net::Server&quot;</span> was partially
    written to make it easy to add new personalities. Using separate modules
    built upon an open architecture allows for easy addition of new features, a
    separate development process, and reduced code bloat in the core module.</p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="SOCKET_ACCESS"><a class="permalink" href="#SOCKET_ACCESS">SOCKET
  ACCESS</a></h1>
Once started, the Net::Server will take care of binding to port and waiting for
  connections. Once a connection is received, the Net::Server will accept on the
  socket and will store the result (the client connection) in
  <span class="Li">$self</span>-&gt;{server}-&gt;{client}. This property is a
  Socket blessed into the the IO::Socket classes. UDP servers are slightly
  different in that they will perform a <b>recv</b> instead of an <b>accept</b>.
<p class="Pp">To make programming easier, during the post_accept phase, STDIN
    and STDOUT are opened to the client connection. This allows for programs to
    be written using &lt;STDIN&gt; and print &quot;out\n&quot; to print to the
    client connection. UDP will require using a -&gt;send call.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="SAMPLE_CODE"><a class="permalink" href="#SAMPLE_CODE">SAMPLE
  CODE</a></h1>
The following is a very simple server. The main functionality occurs in the
  process_request method call as shown below. Notice the use of timeouts to
  prevent Denial of Service while reading. (Other examples of using
  <span class="Li">&quot;Net::Server&quot;</span> can, or will, be included with
  this distribution).
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    #!/usr/bin/perl -w -T

    package MyPackage;

    use strict;
    use base qw(Net::Server::PreFork); # any personality will do

    MyPackage-&gt;run;

    # over-ride the default echo handler

    sub process_request {
        my $self = shift;
        eval {

            local $SIG{'ALRM'} = sub { die &quot;Timed Out!\n&quot; };
            my $timeout = 30; # give the user 30 seconds to type some lines

            my $previous_alarm = alarm($timeout);
            while (&lt;STDIN&gt;) {
                s/\r?\n$//;
                print &quot;You said '$_'\r\n&quot;;
                alarm($timeout);
            }
            alarm($previous_alarm);

        };

        if ($@ =~ /timed out/i) {
            print STDOUT &quot;Timed Out.\r\n&quot;;
            return;
        }

    }

</pre>
<p class="Pp">Playing this file from the command line will invoke a Net::Server
    using the PreFork personality. When building a server layer over the
    Net::Server, it is important to use features such as timeouts to prevent
    Denial Of Service attacks.</p>
<p class="Pp">Net::Server comes with a built in echo server by default. You can
    test it out by simply running the following from the commandline:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    net-server
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If you wanted to try another flavor you could try</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    net-server PreFork
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If you wanted to try out a basic HTTP server you could use</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    net-server HTTP
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Or if you wanted to test out a CGI you are writing you could
  use</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    net-server HTTP --app ../../mycgi.cgi
</pre>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="ARGUMENTS"><a class="permalink" href="#ARGUMENTS">ARGUMENTS</a></h1>
There are at least five possible ways to pass arguments to Net::Server. They are
  <i>passing to the new method</i>, <i>passing on</i> <i>command line</i>,
  <i>passing parameters to run</i>, <i>using a conf file</i>, <i>returning
  values in the default_values method</i>, or <i>configuring the</i> <i>values
  in post_configure_hook</i>.
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;options&quot;</span> method is used to
    determine which arguments the server will search for and can be used to
    extend the parsed parameters. Any arguments found from the command line,
    parameters passed to run, and arguments found in the conf_file will be
    matched against the keys of the options template. Any commandline parameters
    that do not match will be left in place and can be further processed by the
    server in the various hooks (by looking at <span class="Li">@ARGV</span>).
    Arguments passed to new will automatically win over any other options (this
    can be used if you would like to disallow a user passing in other
    arguments).</p>
<p class="Pp">Arguments consist of key value pairs. On the commandline these
    pairs follow the POSIX fashion of <span class="Li">&quot;--key
    value&quot;</span> or <span class="Li">&quot;--key=value&quot;</span>, and
    also <span class="Li">&quot;key=value&quot;</span>. In the conf file the
    parameter passing can best be shown by the following regular expression:
    ($key,$val)=~/^(\w+)\s+(\S+?)\s+$/. Passing arguments to the run method is
    done as follows: <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;Net::Server-&gt;run(key1
    =&quot;</span> 'val1')&gt;&gt;. Passing arguments via a prebuilt object can
    best be shown in the following code:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    #!/usr/bin/perl -w -T

    package MyPackage;
    use strict;
    use base qw(Net::Server);

    my $server = MyPackage-&gt;new({
        key1 =&gt; 'val1',
    });

    $server-&gt;run;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">All five methods for passing arguments may be used at the same
    time. Once an argument has been set, it is not over written if another
    method passes the same argument.
    <span class="Li">&quot;Net::Server&quot;</span> will look for arguments in
    the following order:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    1) Arguments passed to the C&lt;new&gt; method.
    2) Arguments passed on command line.
    3) Arguments passed to the C&lt;run&gt; method.
    4) Arguments passed via a conf file.
    5) Arguments set in the C&lt;default_values&gt; method.
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Additionally the following hooks are available:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    1) Arguments set in the configure_hook (occurs after new
       but before any of the other areas are checked).
    2) Arguments set and validated in the post_configure_hook
       (occurs after all of the other areas are checked).
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Each of these levels will override parameters of the same name
    specified in subsequent levels. For example, specifying --setsid=0 on the
    command line will override a value of &quot;setsid 1&quot; in the conf
  file.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that the configure_hook method doesn't return values to set,
    but is there to allow for setting up configured values before the configure
    method is called.</p>
<p class="Pp">Key/value pairs used by the server are removed by the
    configuration process so that server layers on top of
    <span class="Li">&quot;Net::Server&quot;</span> can pass and read their own
    parameters.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="ADDING_CUSTOM_ARGUMENTS"><a class="permalink" href="#ADDING_CUSTOM_ARGUMENTS">ADDING
  CUSTOM ARGUMENTS</a></h1>
It is possible to add in your own custom parameters to those parsed by
  Net::Server. The following code shows how this is done:
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    sub options {
        my $self     = shift;
        my $prop     = $self-&gt;{'server'};
        my $template = shift;

        # setup options in the parent classes
        $self-&gt;SUPER::options($template);

        # add a single value option
        $prop-&gt;{'my_option'} ||= undef;
        $template-&gt;{'my_option'} = \ $prop-&gt;{'my_option'};

        # add a multi value option
        $prop-&gt;{'an_arrayref_item'} ||= [];
        $template-&gt;{'an_arrayref_item'} = $prop-&gt;{'an_arrayref_item'};
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Overriding the <span class="Li">&quot;options&quot;</span> method
    allows for adding your own custom fields. A template hashref is passed in,
    that should then be modified to contain an of your custom fields. Fields
    which are intended to receive a single scalar value should have a reference
    to the destination scalar given. Fields which are intended to receive
    multiple values should reference the corresponding destination arrayref.</p>
<p class="Pp">You are responsible for validating your custom options once they
    have been parsed. The post_configure_hook is a good place to do your
    validation.</p>
<p class="Pp">Some emails have asked why we use this &quot;template&quot;
    method. The idea is that you are creating the the data structure to store
    the values in, and you are also creating a way to get the values into the
    data structure. The template is the way to get the values to the servers
    data structure. One of the possibilities (that probably isn't used that
    much) is that by letting you specify the mapping, you could build a nested
    data structure - even though the passed in arguments are flat. It also
    allows you to setup aliases to your names.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, a basic structure might look like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
   $prop = $self-&gt;{'server'}

   $prop-&gt;{'my_custom_option'} ||= undef;
   $prop-&gt;{'my_custom_array'}  ||= [];

   $template = {
       my_custom_option =&gt; \ $prop-&gt;{'my_custom_option'},
       mco              =&gt; \ $prop-&gt;{'my_custom_option'}, # alias
       my_custom_array  =&gt; $prop-&gt;{'my_custom_array'},
       mca              =&gt; $prop-&gt;{'my_custom_array'}, # an alias
   };

   $template-&gt;{'mco2'} = $template-&gt;{'mco'}; # another way to alias
</pre>
<p class="Pp">But you could also have more complex data:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
   $prop = $self-&gt;{'server'};

   $prop-&gt;{'one_layer'} = {
       two_layer =&gt; [
           undef,
           undef,
       ],
   };

   $template = {
       param1 =&gt; \ $prop-&gt;{'one_layer'}-&gt;{'two_layer'}-&gt;[0],
       param2 =&gt; \ $prop-&gt;{'one_layer'}-&gt;{'two_layer'}-&gt;[1],
   };
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This is of course a contrived example - but it does show that you
    can get the data from the flat passed in arguments to whatever type of
    structure you need - with only a little bit of effort.</p>

  <dt>conf_file</dt>
  <dd>Filename from which to read additional key value pair arguments for
      starting the server. Default is undef.
    <p class="Pp">There are two ways that you can specify a default location for
        a conf_file. The first is to pass the default value to the run method as
        in:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    MyServer-&gt;run({
       conf_file =&gt; '/etc/my_server.conf',
    });
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If the end user passes in --conf_file=/etc/their_server.conf
        then the value will be overridden.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The second way to do this was added in the 0.96 version. It
        uses the default_values method as in:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    sub default_values {
        return {
            conf_file =&gt; '/etc/my_server.conf',
        }
    }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This method has the advantage of also being able to be
        overridden in the run method.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you do not want the user to be able to specify a conf_file
        at all, you can pass conf_file to the new method when creating your
        object:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    MyServer-&gt;new({

        &quot;win&quot; over any of the other passed in values.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>log_level</dt>
  <dd>Ranges from 0 to 4 in level. Specifies what level of error will be logged.
      &quot;O&quot; means logging is off. &quot;4&quot; means very verbose.
      These levels should be able to correlate to syslog levels. Default is 2.
      These levels correlate to syslog levels as defined by the following
      key/value pairs: 0=&gt;'err', 1=&gt;'warning', 2=&gt;'notice',
      3=&gt;'info', 4=&gt;'debug'.</dd>
  <dt>log_file</dt>
  <dd>Name of log file or log subsystem to be written to. If no name is given
      and the write_to_log_hook is not overridden, log goes to STDERR. Default
      is undef.
    <p class="Pp">The log_file may also be the name of a Net::Server pluggable
        logging class. Net::Server is packaged with Sys::Syslog and
        Log::Log4perl. If the log_file looks like a module name, it will have
        &quot;Net::Server::Log::&quot; added to the front and it will then be
        required. The package should provide an
        <span class="Li">&quot;initialize&quot;</span> class method that returns
        a single function which will be used for logging. This returned function
        will be passed log_level, and message.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If the magic name &quot;Sys::Syslog&quot; is used, all logging
        will take place via the Net::Server::Log::Sys::Syslog module. If syslog
        is used the parameters
        <span class="Li">&quot;syslog_logsock&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;syslog_ident&quot;</span>, and
        <span class="Li">&quot;syslog_logopt&quot;</span>,and
        <span class="Li">&quot;syslog_facility&quot;</span> may also be defined.
        See Net::Server::Log::Sys::Syslog.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If the magic name &quot;Log::Log4perl&quot; is used, all
        logging will be directed to the Log4perl system. If used, the
        <span class="Li">&quot;log4perl_conf&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;log4perl_poll&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;log4perl_logger&quot;</span> may also be defined.
        See Net::Server::Log::Log::Log4per.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If a <span class="Li">&quot;log_file&quot;</span> is given or
        if <span class="Li">&quot;setsid&quot;</span> is set, STDIN and STDOUT
        will automatically be opened to /dev/null and STDERR will be opened to
        STDOUT. This will prevent any output from ending up at the terminal.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>pid_file</dt>
  <dd>Filename to store pid of parent process. Generally applies only to forking
      servers. Default is none (undef).</dd>
  <dt>port</dt>
  <dd>See Net::Server::Proto for further examples of configuration.
    <p class="Pp">Local port/socket on which to bind. If it is a low port, the
        process must start as root. If multiple ports are given, all will be
        bound at server startup. May be of the form
        <span class="Li">&quot;host:port/proto&quot;</span>,

        the number of the port (eg. &quot;80&quot;) or the service designation
        (eg. &quot;http&quot;), where <i>ipv</i> represents the IP protocol
        version (IPv4 or IPv6 or IPv*) and where <i>proto</i> represents the
        protocol to be used. See Net::Server::Proto. The following are some
        valid port strings:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    20203                            # port only

    localhost:20203/IPv4/IPv6        # bind localhost on IPv4 and 6 (fails if it cannot do both)

    *:20203                          # bind all local interfaces
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Additionally, when passed in the code (non-commandline, and
        non-config), the port may be passed as a hashref or array hashrefs of
        information:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    port =&gt; {
        host  =&gt; 'localhost',
        port  =&gt; '20203',
        ipv   =&gt; 6,     # IPv6 only

    }

    port =&gt; [{
        host  =&gt; '*',

        ipv   =&gt; 4,     # IPv4 only
        proto =&gt; 'tcp', # (default)
    }, {
        host  =&gt; 'localhost',
        port  =&gt; '20204',
        ipv   =&gt; '*',      # default - all IPv4 and IPv6 interfaces tied to localhost
        proto =&gt; 'ssleay', # or ssl - Using SSL
    }],
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">An explicit <i>host</i> given in a port specification
        overrides a default binding address (a
        <span class="Li">&quot;host&quot;</span> setting, see below). The
        <i>host</i> part may be enclosed in square brackets, but when it is a
        numerical IPv6 address it <b>should</b> be enclosed in square brackets
        to avoid ambiguity in parsing a port number, e.g.: &quot;[::1]:80&quot;.
        However you could also use pipes, white space, or commas to separate
        these. Note that host and port number must come first.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If the protocol is not specified, <i>proto</i> will default to
        the <span class="Li">&quot;proto&quot;</span> specified in the
        arguments. If <span class="Li">&quot;proto&quot;</span> is not specified
        there it will default to &quot;tcp&quot;. If <i>host</i> is not
        specified, <i>host</i> will default to
        <span class="Li">&quot;host&quot;</span> specified in the arguments. If
        <span class="Li">&quot;host&quot;</span> is not specified there it will
        default to &quot;*&quot;. Default port is 20203. Configuration passed to
        new or run may be either a scalar containing a single port number or an
        arrayref of ports. If <span class="Li">&quot;ipv&quot;</span> is not
        specified it will default to &quot;*&quot; (Any resolved addresses under
        IPv4 or IPv6).</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you are working with unix sockets, you may also specify
        <span class="Li">&quot;socket_file|unix&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;socket_file|type|unix&quot;</span> where type is
        SOCK_DGRAM or SOCK_STREAM.</p>
    <p class="Pp">On systems that support it, a port value of 0 may be used to
        ask the OS to auto-assign a port. The value of the auto-assigned port
        will be stored in the NS_port property of the Net::Server::Proto::TCP
        object and is also available in the sockport method. When the server is
        processing a request, the
        <span class="Li">$self</span>-&gt;{server}-&gt;{sockport} property
        contains the port that was connected through.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>host</dt>
  <dd>Local host or addr upon which to bind port. If a value of '*' is given,
      the server will bind that port on all available addresses on the box. The
      <span class="Li">&quot;host&quot;</span> argument provides a default local
      host address if the <span class="Li">&quot;port&quot;</span> argument
      omits a host specification. See Net::Server::Proto. See IO::Socket.
      Configuration passed to new or run may be either a scalar containing a
      single host or an arrayref of hosts - if the hosts array is shorter than
      the ports array, the last host entry will be used to augment the hosts
      arrary to the size of the ports array.
    <p class="Pp">If an IPv4 address is passed, an IPv4 socket will be created.
        If an IPv6 address is passed, an IPv6 socket will be created. If a
        hostname is given, Net::Server will look at the value of ipv (default
        IPv4) to determine which type of socket to create. Optionally the ipv
        specification can be passed as part of the hostname.</p>

  <dd>See Net::Server::Proto. Protocol to use when binding ports. See
      IO::Socket. As of release 2.0, Net::Server supports tcp, udp, and unix,
      unixdgram, ssl, and ssleay. Other types will need to be added later (or
      custom modules extending the Net::Server::Proto class may be used).
      Configuration passed to new or run may be either a scalar containing a
      single proto or an arrayref of protos - if the protos array is shorter
      than the ports array, the last proto entry will be used to augment the

        is a significant change from version 2.004 and earlier where the default
        value was IPv4. However, the previous behavior led to confusion on IPv6
        only hosts, and on hosts that only had IPv6 entries for a local
        hostname. Trying to pass an IPv4 address when ipv is set to 6 (only 6 -
        not * or 4) will result in an error.</p>

        net.inet6.ip6.v6only). If this setting is false, then an IPv6 socket
        will listen for the corresponding IPv4 address. For example the address
        [::] (IPv6 equivalent of INADDR_ANY) will also listen for 0.0.0.0. The
        address ::FFFF:127.0.0.1 (IPv6) would also listen to 127.0.0.1 (IPv4).
        In this case, only one socket will be created because it will handle
        both cases (an error is returned if an attempt is made to listen to both
        addresses when bindv6only is false).</p>
    <p class="Pp">However, if net.ipv6.bindv6only (or equivalent) is true, then

    <p class="Pp">BSD differs from linux and generally defaults to
        net.inet6.ip6.v6only=0. If it cannot be determined on your OS, it will
        default to false and the log message will change from &quot;it will be
        handled&quot; to &quot;it should be handled&quot; (if you have a
        non-resource intensive way to check on your platform, feel free to email
        me). Be sure to check the logs as you test your server to make sure you
        have bound the ports you desire. You can always pass in individual
        explicit IPv4 and IPv6 port specifications if you need. For example, if
        your system has both IPv4 and IPv6 interfaces but you'd only like to
        bind to IPv6 entries, then you should use a hostname of [::] instead of
        [*].</p>
    <p class="Pp">If bindv6only (or equivalent) is false, and you receive an
        IPv4 connection on a bound IPv6 port, the textual representation of the
        peer's IPv4 address will typically be in a form of an IPv4-mapped IPv6
        addresses, e.g. &quot;::FFFF:127.0.0.1&quot; .</p>
    <p class="Pp">The ipv parameter was chosen because it does not conflict with
        any other existing usage, it is very similar to ipv4 or ipv6, it allows
        for user code to not need to know about Socket::AF_INET or
        Socket6::AF_INET6 or Socket::AF_UNSPEC, and it is short.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>listen</dt>
  <dd>See IO::Socket. Not used with udp protocol (or UNIX SOCK_DGRAM).</dd>
  <dt>reverse_lookups</dt>
  <dd>Specify whether to lookup the hostname of the connected IP. Information is
      cached in server object under <span class="Li">&quot;peerhost&quot;</span>
      property. Default is to not use reverse_lookups (undef).</dd>
  <dt>allow/deny</dt>
  <dd>May be specified multiple times. Contains regex to compare to incoming
      peeraddr or peerhost (if reverse_lookups has been enabled). If allow or
      deny options are given, the incoming client must match an allow and not
      match a deny or the client connection will be closed. Defaults to empty
      array refs.</dd>
  <dt>cidr_allow/cidr_deny</dt>
  <dd>May be specified multiple times. Contains a CIDR block to compare to
      incoming peeraddr. If cidr_allow or cidr_deny options are given, the
      incoming client must match a cidr_allow and not match a cidr_deny or the
      client connection will be closed. Defaults to empty array refs.</dd>
  <dt>chroot</dt>
  <dd>Directory to chroot to after bind process has taken place and the server
      is still running as root. Defaults to undef.</dd>
  <dt>user</dt>
  <dd>Userid or username to become after the bind process has occured. Defaults
      to &quot;nobody.&quot; If you would like the server to run as root, you
      will have to specify <span class="Li">&quot;user&quot;</span> equal to
      &quot;root&quot;.</dd>
  <dt>group</dt>
  <dd>Groupid or groupname to become after the bind process has occured.
      Defaults to &quot;nobody.&quot; If you would like the server to run as
      root, you will have to specify <span class="Li">&quot;group&quot;</span>
      equal to &quot;root&quot;.</dd>
  <dt>background</dt>
  <dd>Specifies whether or not the server should fork after the bind method to
      release itself from the command line. Defaults to undef. Process will also
      background if <span class="Li">&quot;setsid&quot;</span> is set.</dd>
  <dt>setsid</dt>
  <dd>Specifies whether or not the server should fork after the bind method to
      release itself from the command line and then run the
      <span class="Li">&quot;POSIX::setsid()&quot;</span> command to truly
      daemonize. Defaults to undef. If a
      <span class="Li">&quot;log_file&quot;</span> is given or if
      <span class="Li">&quot;setsid&quot;</span> is set, STDIN and STDOUT will
      automatically be opened to /dev/null and STDERR will be opened to STDOUT.
      This will prevent any output from ending up at the terminal.</dd>
  <dt>no_close_by_child</dt>
  <dd>Boolean. Specifies whether or not a forked child process has permission or
      not to shutdown the entire server process. If set to 1, the child may NOT
      signal the parent to shutdown all children. Default is undef (not
    set).</dd>
  <dt>no_client_stdout</dt>
  <dd>Boolean. Default undef (not set). Specifies that STDIN and STDOUT should
      not be opened on the client handle once a connection has been accepted. By
      default the Net::Server will open STDIN and STDOUT on the client socket
      making it easier for many types of scripts to read directly from and write
      directly to the socket using normal print and read methods. Disabling this
      is useful on clients that may be opening their own connections to STDIN
      and STDOUT.
    <p class="Pp">This option has no affect on STDIN and STDOUT which has a
        magic client property that is tied to the already open STDIN and
      STDOUT.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>leave_children_open_on_hup</dt>
  <dd>Boolean. Default undef (not set). If set, the parent will not attempt to
      close child processes if the parent receives a SIG HUP. The parent will
      rebind the the open port and begin tracking a fresh set of children.
    <p class="Pp">Children of a Fork server will exit after their current
        request. Children of a Prefork type server will finish the current
        request and then exit.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note - the newly restarted parent will start up a fresh set of
        servers on fork servers. The new parent will attempt to keep track of
        the children from the former parent but custom communication channels
        (open pipes from the child to the old parent) will no longer be
        available to the old child processes. New child processes will still
        connect properly to the new parent.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>sig_passthrough</dt>
  <dd>Default none. Allow for passing requested signals through to children.
      Takes a single signal name, a comma separated list of names, or an
      arrayref of signal names. It first sends the signals to the children
      before calling any currently registered signal by that name.</dd>
  <dt>tie_client_stdout</dt>
  <dd>Default undef. If set will use Net::Server::TiedHandle tied interface for
      STDIN and STDOUT. This interface allows SSL and SSLEAY to work. It also
      allows for intercepting read and write via the tied_stdin_callback and
      tied_stdout_callback.</dd>
  <dt>tied_stdin_callback</dt>
  <dd>Default undef. Called during a read of STDIN data if tie_client_stdout has
      been set, or if the client handle's tie_stdout method returns true. It is
      passed the client connection, the name of the method that would be called,
      and the arguments that are being passed. The callback is then responsible
      for calling that method on the handle or for performing some other input
      operation.</dd>
  <dt>tied_stdout_callback</dt>
  <dd>Default undef. Called during a write of data to STDOUT if
      tie_client_stdout has been set, or if the client handle's tie_stdout
      method returns true. It is passed the client connection, the name of the
      method that would be called, and the arguments that are being passed. The
      callback is then responsible for calling that method on the handle or for
      performing some other output operation.</dd>

All of the <span class="Li">&quot;ARGUMENTS&quot;</span> listed above become
  properties of the server object under the same name. These properties, as well
  as other internal properties, are available during hooks and other method

    }, 'Net::Server');
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This structure was chosen so that all server related properties
    are grouped under a single key of the object hashref. This is so that other
    objects could layer on top of the Net::Server object class and still have a
    fairly clean namespace in the hashref.</p>
<p class="Pp">You may get and set properties in two ways. The suggested way is
    to access properties directly via</p>

    my $val = $self-&gt;{server}-&gt;{key1};
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Accessing the properties directly will speed the server process -
    though some would deem this as bad style. A second way has been provided for
    object oriented types who believe in methods. The second way consists of the
    following methods:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    my $val = $self-&gt;get_property( 'key1' );
    my $self-&gt;set_property( key1 =&gt; 'val1' );

      specified by passed in parameters, or in the default_values). All of the
      configured parameters are then stored in the {&quot;server&quot;} property
      of the Server object.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;$self-&gt;post_configure&quot;</dt>
  <dd>The post_configure hook begins the startup of the server. During this
      method running server instances are checked for, pid_files are created,
      log_files are created, Sys::Syslog is initialized (as needed), process
      backgrounding occurs and the server closes STDIN and STDOUT (as
    needed).</dd>
  <dt>&quot;$self-&gt;pre_bind&quot;</dt>

    <p class="Pp">Net::Server::Fork forks off a new child process for each
        incoming connection.</p>

        processes that all accept on incoming connections.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Net::Server::PreFork starts up a base number of child
        processes which all accept on incoming connections. The server throttles
        the number of processes running depending upon the number of requests
        coming in (similar to concept to how Apache controls its child processes
        in a PreFork server).</p>

    <p class="Pp">This method takes care of cleaning up any remaining child
        processes, setting appropriate flags on sockets (for HUPing), closing up
        logging, and then closing open sockets.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="HOOKS"><a class="permalink" href="#HOOKS">HOOKS</a></h1>
<span class="Li">&quot;Net::Server&quot;</span> provides a number of
  &quot;hooks&quot; allowing for servers layered on top of
  <span class="Li">&quot;Net::Server&quot;</span> to respond at different levels
  of execution without having to &quot;SUPER&quot; class the main built-in
  methods. The placement of the hooks can be seen in the PROCESS FLOW section.
<p class="Pp">Almost all of the default hook methods do nothing. To use a hook
    you simply need to override the method in your subclass. For example to add
    your own post_configure_hook you could do something like the following:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    package MyServer;

    sub post_configure_hook {
        my $self = shift;
        my $prop = $self-&gt;{'server'};

        # do some validation here
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The following describes the hooks available in the plain
    Net::Server class (other flavors such as Fork or PreFork have additional
    hooks).</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>&quot;$self-&gt;configure_hook()&quot;</dt>
  <dd>This hook takes place immediately after the
      <span class="Li">&quot;-&gt;run()&quot;</span> method is called. This hook
      allows for setting up the object before any built in configuration takes
      place. This allows for custom configurability.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;$self-&gt;post_configure_hook()&quot;</dt>
  <dd>This hook occurs just after the reading of configuration parameters and
      initiation of logging and pid_file creation. It also occurs before the
      <span class="Li">&quot;-&gt;pre_bind()&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;-&gt;bind()&quot;</span> methods are called. This
      hook allows for verifying configuration parameters.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;$self-&gt;post_bind_hook()&quot;</dt>
  <dd>This hook occurs just after the bind process and just before any
      chrooting, change of user, or change of group occurs. At this point the
      process will still be running as the user who started the server.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;$self-&gt;pre_loop_hook()&quot;</dt>
  <dd>This hook occurs after chroot, change of user, and change of group has
      occured. It allows for preparation before looping begins.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;$self-&gt;can_read_hook()&quot;</dt>
  <dd>This hook occurs after a socket becomes readible on an accept_multi_port
      request (accept_multi_port is used if there are multiple bound ports to
      accept on, or if the &quot;multi_port&quot; configuration parameter is set
      to true). This hook is intended to allow for processing of arbitrary
      handles added to the IO::Select used for the accept_multi_port. These
      handles could be added during the post_bind_hook. No internal support is
      added for processing these handles or adding them to the IO::Socket. Care
      must be used in how much occurs during the can_read_hook as a long
      response time will result in the server being susceptible to DOS attacks.
      A return value of true indicates that the Server should not pass the
      readible handle on to the post_accept and process_request phases.
    <p class="Pp">It is generally suggested that other avenues be pursued for
        sending messages via sockets not created by the Net::Server.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>&quot;$self-&gt;post_accept_hook()&quot;</dt>
  <dd>This hook occurs after a client has connected to the server. At this point
      STDIN and STDOUT are mapped to the client socket. This hook occurs before
      the processing of the request.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;$self-&gt;allow_deny_hook()&quot;</dt>
  <dd>This hook allows for the checking of ip and host information beyond the
      <span class="Li">&quot;$self-&gt;allow_deny()&quot;</span> routine. If
      this hook returns 1, the client request will be processed, otherwise, the
      request will be denied processing.
    <p class="Pp">As of version 2.000, the client connection is passed as an
        argument.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>&quot;$self-&gt;request_denied_hook()&quot;</dt>
  <dd>This hook occurs if either the
      <span class="Li">&quot;$self-&gt;allow_deny()&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;$self-&gt;allow_deny_hook()&quot;</span> have taken
      place.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;$self-&gt;post_process_request_hook()&quot;</dt>
  <dd>This hook occurs after the processing of the request, but before the
      client connection has been closed.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;$self-&gt;post_client_connection_hook&quot;</dt>
  <dd>This is one final hook that occurs at the very end of the
      run_client_connection method. At this point all other methods and hooks
      that will run during the run_client_connection have finished and the
      client connection has already been closed.
    <p class="Pp">item
        <span class="Li">&quot;$self-&gt;other_child_died_hook($pid)&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="Pp">Net::Server takes control of signal handling and child process
        cleanup; this makes it difficult to tell when a child process terminates
        if that child process was not started by Net::Server itself. If
        Net::Server notices another child process dying that it did not start,
        it will fire this hook with the PID of the terminated process.</p>

  <dt>&quot;$self-&gt;pre_server_close_hook()&quot;</dt>
  <dd>This hook occurs before the server begins shutting down.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;$self-&gt;write_to_log_hook&quot;</dt>
  <dd>This hook handles writing to log files. The default hook is to write to
      STDERR, or to the filename contained in the parameter
      <span class="Li">&quot;log_file&quot;</span>. The arguments passed are a
      log level of 0 to 4 (4 being very verbose), and a log line. If log_file is
      equal to &quot;Sys::Syslog&quot;, then logging will go to Sys::Syslog and
      will bypass the write_to_log_hook.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;$self-&gt;fatal_hook&quot;</dt>
  <dd>This hook occurs when the server has encountered an unrecoverable error.
      Arguments passed are the error message, the package, file, and line
      number. The hook may close the server, but it is suggested that it simply
      return and use the built in shut down features.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;$self-&gt;post_child_cleanup_hook&quot;</dt>
  <dd>This hook occurs in the parent server process after all children have been
      shut down and just before the server either restarts or exits. It is
      intended for additional cleanup of information. At this point pid_files
      and lockfiles still exist.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;$self-&gt;restart_open_hook&quot;</dt>
  <dd>This hook occurs if a server has been HUPed (restarted via the HUP signal.
      It occurs just before reopening to the filenos of the sockets that were
      already opened.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;$self-&gt;restart_close_hook&quot;</dt>
  <dd>This hook occurs if a server has been HUPed (restarted via the HUP signal.
      It occurs just before restarting the server via exec.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;$self-&gt;child_init_hook()&quot;</dt>
  <dd>This hook is called during the forking servers. It is also called during
      run_dequeue. It runs just after the fork and after signals have been
      cleaned up. If it is a dequeue process, the string 'dequeue' will be
      passed as an argument.
    <p class="Pp">If your child processes will be needing random numbers, this
        hook is a good location to initialize srand (forked processes maintain
        the same random seed unless changed).</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    sub child_init_hook {
        # from perldoc -f srand
        srand(time ^ $$ ^ unpack &quot;%L*&quot;, `ps axww | gzip -f`);
    }
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>&quot;$self-&gt;pre_fork_hook()&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Similar to the child_init_hook, but occurs just before the fork.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;$self-&gt;child_finish_hook()&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Similar to the child_init_hook, but ran when the forked process is about
      to finish up.</dd>

<h1 class="Sh" id="RESTARTING"><a class="permalink" href="#RESTARTING">RESTARTING</a></h1>
Each of the server personalities (except for INET), support restarting via a HUP
  signal (see &quot;kill -l&quot;). When a HUP is received, the server will
  close children (if any), make sure that sockets are left open, and re-exec
  using the same commandline parameters that initially started the server.
  (Note: for this reason it is important that <span class="Li">@ARGV</span> is
  not modified until <span class="Li">&quot;-&gt;run&quot;</span> is called).
<p class="Pp">The Net::Server will attempt to find out the commandline used for
    starting the program. The attempt is made before any configuration files or
    other arguments are processed. The outcome of this attempt is stored using
    the method <span class="Li">&quot;-&gt;commandline&quot;</span>. The stored
    commandline may also be retrieved using the same method name. The stored
    contents will undoubtedly contain Tainted items that will cause the server
    to die during a restart when using the -T flag (Taint mode). As it is
    impossible to arbitrarily decide what is taint safe and what is not, the
    individual program must clean up the tainted items before doing a
  restart.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    sub configure_hook{
        my $self = shift;

        ### see the contents
        my $ref  = $self-&gt;commandline;
        use Data::Dumper;
        print Dumper $ref;

        ### arbitrary untainting - VERY dangerous
        my @untainted = map {/(.+)/;$1} @$ref;

<h1 class="Sh" id="SHUTDOWN"><a class="permalink" href="#SHUTDOWN">SHUTDOWN</a></h1>
Each of the Fork and PreFork personalities support graceful shutdowns via the
  QUIT signal. When a QUIT is received, the parent will signal the children and
  then wait for them to exit.
<p class="Pp">All server personalities support the normal TERM and INT signal
    shutdowns.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="HOT_DEPLOY"><a class="permalink" href="#HOT_DEPLOY">HOT
  DEPLOY</a></h1>
Since version 2.000, the Fork and PreFork personalities have accepted the TTIN
  and TTOU signals. When a TTIN is received, the max_servers is increased by 1.
  If a TTOU signal is received the max_servers is decreased by 1. This allows
  for adjusting the number of handling processes without having to restart the
  server.
<p class="Pp">If the log_level is set to at 3, then the new value is displayed
    in the logs.</p>

Thanks to Rob Brown (bbb at cpan.org) for help with miscellaneous concepts such
  as tracking down the serialized select via flock ala Apache and the reference
  to IO::Select making multiport servers possible. And for researching into
  allowing sockets to remain open upon exec (making HUP possible).
<p class="Pp">Thanks to Jonathan J. Miner &lt;miner at doit.wisc.edu&gt; for
    patching a blatant problem in the reverse lookups.</p>
<p class="Pp">Thanks to Bennett Todd &lt;bet at rahul.net&gt; for pointing out a
    problem in Solaris 2.5.1 which does not allow multiple children to accept on
    the same port at the same time. Also for showing some sample code from
    Viktor Duchovni which now represents the semaphore option of the serialize
    argument in the PreFork server.</p>
<p class="Pp">Thanks to <i>traveler</i> and <i>merlyn</i> from
    http://perlmonks.org for pointing me in the right direction for determining
    the protocol used on a socket connection.</p>

    the Proto::SSL implementation that currently locks around the socket accept
    and the SSL negotiation. See Net::Server::Proto::SSL.</p>
<p class="Pp">Thanks to Alessandro Zummo for pointing out various bugs including
    some in configuration, commandline args, and cidr_allow.</p>

    diagnosing more correct behavior for dealing with re-opening STDIN and
    STDOUT on the client handles.</p>
<p class="Pp">Thanks to Mark Martinec for trouble shooting other problems with
    STDIN and STDOUT (he proposed having a flag that is now the no_client_stdout
    flag).</p>
<p class="Pp">Thanks to David (DSCHWEI) on cpan for asking for the nofatal

    supporting flock. Rob also suggested not closing STDIN/STDOUT but instead
    reopening them to /dev/null to prevent spurious warnings. Also suggested
    short circuit in post_accept if in UDP. Also for cleaning up some of the
    child managment code of PreFork.</p>

    wasn't working with the Multiplex server.</p>
<p class="Pp">Thanks to Peter Beckman for suggesting allowing Sys::SysLog
    keyworks be passed through the -&gt;log method and for suggesting we allow
    more types of characters through in syslog_ident. Also to Peter Beckman for
    pointing out that a poorly setup localhost will cause tests to hang.</p>
<p class="Pp">Thanks to Curtis Wilbar for pointing out that the Fork server
    called post_accept_hook twice. Changed to only let the child process call
