   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

  	# Set up traps and other miscellaneous stuff for Tcl/Tk man pages.
  	# Start an argument description
  .b
  	# define tabbing values for .AP
  
  	# BS - start boxed text
  	# ^y = starting y location
  	# ^b = 1
  	# BE - end boxed text (draw box now)
  	Draw four-sided box normally, but don't draw top of
  	box if the box started on an earlier page.
  	# VS - start vertical sidebar
  	# ^Y = starting y location
  	# ^v = 1 (for troff;  for nroff this doesn't matter)
  	# VE - end of vertical sidebar
  	# Special macro to handle page bottom:  finish off current
  	# box/sidebar if in box/sidebar mode, then invoked standard
  	# page bottom macro.
  	Draw three-sided box if this is the box's first page,
  	draw two sides but no top otherwise.
  	# DS - begin display
  	# DE - end display
  	# SO - start of list of standard options
  	# SE - end of list of standard options
  	# OP - start of full description for a single option
  	# CS - begin code excerpt
  	# CE - end code excerpt
  	# UL - underline word
  	# QW - apply quotation marks to word
  " fix emacs highlighting
  	# PQ - apply parens and quotation marks to word
  " fix emacs highlighting
  	# QR - quoted range

When a binding is created with the <b>bind</b> command, it is associated either
  with a particular window such as <b>.a.b.c</b>, a class name such as
  <b>Button</b>, the keyword <b>all</b>, or any other string. All of these forms
  are called <i>binding tags</i>. Each window contains a list of binding tags
  that determine how events are processed for the window. When an event occurs
  in a window, it is applied to each of the window's tags in order: for each
  tag, the most specific binding that matches the given tag and event is
  executed. See the <b>bind</b> command for more information on the matching
  process.
<p class="Pp">By default, each window has four binding tags consisting of the
    name of the window, the window's class name, the name of the window's
    nearest toplevel ancestor, and <b>all</b>, in that order. Toplevel windows
    have only three tags by default, since the toplevel name is the same as that
    of the window. The <b>bindtags</b> command allows the binding tags for a
    window to be read and modified.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <b>bindtags</b> is invoked with only one argument, then the
    current set of binding tags for <i>window</i> is returned as a list. If the
    <i>tagList</i> argument is specified to <b>bindtags</b>, then it must be a
    proper list; the tags for <i>window</i> are changed to the elements of the
    list. The elements of <i>tagList</i> may be arbitrary strings; however, any
    tag starting with a dot is treated as the name of a window; if no window by
    that name exists at the time an event is processed, then the tag is ignored
    for that event. The order of the elements in <i>tagList</i> determines the
    order in which binding scripts are executed in response to events. For
    example, the command</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b>bindtags .b {all . Button .b}</b>
</pre>
</div>
reverses the order in which binding scripts will be evaluated for a button named
  <b>.b</b> so that <b>all</b> bindings are invoked first, following by bindings
  for <b>.b</b>'s toplevel (&#x201C;.&#x201D;), followed by class bindings,
  followed by bindings for <b>.b</b>. If <i>tagList</i> is an empty list then
  the binding tags for <i>window</i> are returned to the default state described
  above.
<p class="Pp">The <b>bindtags</b> command may be used to introduce arbitrary
    additional binding tags for a window, or to remove standard tags. For
    example, the command</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b>bindtags .b {.b TrickyButton . all}</b>
</pre>
</div>
replaces the <b>Button</b> tag for <b>.b</b> with <b>TrickyButton</b>. This
  means that the default widget bindings for buttons, which are associated with
  the <b>Button</b> tag, will no longer apply to <b>.b</b>, but any bindings
  associated with <b>TrickyButton</b> (perhaps some new button behavior) will
  apply.

If you have a set of nested <b>frame</b> widgets and you want events sent to a
  <b>button</b> widget to also be delivered to all the widgets up to the current
  <b>toplevel</b> (in contrast to Tk's default behavior, where events are not
  delivered to those intermediate windows) to make it easier to have
  accelerators that are only active for part of a window, you could use a helper
  procedure like this to help set things up:
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
proc setupBindtagsForTreeDelivery {widget} {
    set tags [list $widget [winfo class $widget]]
    set w $widget
    set t [winfo toplevel $w]
    while {$w ne $t} {
        set w [winfo parent $w]
        lappend tags $w
    }
    lappend tags all
    <b>bindtags</b> $widget $tags
}
