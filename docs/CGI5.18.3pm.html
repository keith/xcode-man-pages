CGI.pm is a stable, complete and mature solution for processing and preparing
  HTTP requests and responses. Major features including processing form
  submissions, file uploads, reading and writing cookies, query string
  generation and manipulation, and processing and preparing HTTP headers. Some
  HTML generation utilities are included as well.
<p class="Pp">CGI.pm performs very well in in a vanilla CGI.pm environment and
    also comes with built-in support for mod_perl and mod_perl2 as well as
    FastCGI.</p>
<p class="Pp">It has the benefit of having developed and refined over 10 years
    with input from dozens of contributors and being deployed on thousands of
    websites. CGI.pm has been included in the Perl distribution since Perl 5.4,
    and has become a de-facto standard.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="_s-1PROGRAMMING_STYLE_s0"><a class="permalink" href="#_s-1PROGRAMMING_STYLE_s0">PROGRAMMING
  STYLE</a></h2>
There are two styles of programming with CGI.pm, an object-oriented style and a
  function-oriented style. In the object-oriented style you create one or more
  CGI objects and then use object methods to create the various elements of the
  page. Each CGI object starts out with the list of named parameters that were
  passed to your CGI script by the server. You can modify the objects, save them
  to a file or database and recreate them. Because each object corresponds to
  the &quot;state&quot; of the CGI script, and because each object's parameter
  list is independent of the others, this allows you to save the state of the
  script and restore it later.
<p class="Pp">For example, using the object oriented style, here is how you
    create a simple &quot;Hello World&quot; HTML page:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
   #!/usr/local/bin/perl -w
   use CGI;                             # load CGI routines
   $q = CGI-&gt;new;                        # create new CGI object
   print $q-&gt;header,                    # create the HTTP header
         $q-&gt;start_html('hello world'), # start the HTML
         $q-&gt;h1('hello world'),         # level 1 header
         $q-&gt;end_html;                  # end the HTML
</pre>
<p class="Pp">In the function-oriented style, there is one default CGI object
    that you rarely deal with directly. Instead you just call functions to
    retrieve CGI parameters, create HTML tags, manage cookies, and so on. This
    provides you with a cleaner programming interface, but limits you to using
    one CGI object at a time. The following example prints the same page, but
    uses the function-oriented interface. The main differences are that we now
    need to import a set of functions into our name space (usually the
    &quot;standard&quot; functions), and we don't need to create the CGI
  object.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
   #!/usr/local/bin/perl
   use CGI qw/:standard/;           # load standard CGI routines
   print header,                    # create the HTTP header
         start_html('hello world'), # start the HTML
         h1('hello world'),         # level 1 header
         end_html;                  # end the HTML
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The examples in this document mainly use the object-oriented
    style. See HOW TO IMPORT FUNCTIONS for important information on
    function-oriented programming in CGI.pm</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="_s-1CALLING_CGI.PM_ROUTINES_s0"><a class="permalink" href="#_s-1CALLING_CGI.PM_ROUTINES_s0">CALLING
  CGI.PM ROUTINES</a></h2>
Most CGI.pm routines accept several arguments, sometimes as many as 20 optional
  ones! To simplify this interface, all routines use a named argument calling
  style that looks like this:
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
   print $q-&gt;header(-type=&gt;'image/gif',-expires=&gt;'+3d');
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Each argument name is preceded by a dash. Neither case nor order
    matters in the argument list. -type, -Type, and -TYPE are all acceptable. In
    fact, only the first argument needs to begin with a dash. If a dash is
    present in the first argument, CGI.pm assumes dashes for the subsequent
    ones.</p>
<p class="Pp">Several routines are commonly called with just one argument. In
    the case of these routines you can provide the single argument without an
    argument name. <i>header()</i> happens to be one of these routines. In this
    case, the single argument is the document type.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
   print $q-&gt;header('text/html');
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Other such routines are documented below.</p>
<p class="Pp">Sometimes named arguments expect a scalar, sometimes a reference
    to an array, and sometimes a reference to a hash. Often, you can pass any
    type of argument and the routine will do whatever is most appropriate. For
    example, the <i>param()</i> routine is used to set a CGI parameter to a
    single or a multi-valued value. The two cases are shown below:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
   $q-&gt;param(-name=&gt;'veggie',-value=&gt;'tomato');
   $q-&gt;param(-name=&gt;'veggie',-value=&gt;['tomato','tomahto','potato','potahto']);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">A large number of routines in CGI.pm actually aren't specifically
    defined in the module, but are generated automatically as needed. These are
    the &quot;HTML shortcuts,&quot; routines that generate HTML tags for use in
    dynamically-generated pages. HTML tags have both attributes (the
    attribute=&quot;value&quot; pairs within the tag itself) and contents (the
    part between the opening and closing pairs.) To distinguish between
    attributes and contents, CGI.pm uses the convention of passing HTML
    attributes as a hash reference as the first argument, and the contents, if
    any, as any subsequent arguments. It works out like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
   Code                           Generated HTML
   ----                           --------------
   h1()                           &lt;h1&gt;
   h1('some','contents');         &lt;h1&gt;some contents&lt;/h1&gt;
   h1({-align=&gt;left});            &lt;h1 align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;
   h1({-align=&gt;left},'contents'); &lt;h1 align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;contents&lt;/h1&gt;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">HTML tags are described in more detail later.</p>
<p class="Pp">Many newcomers to CGI.pm are puzzled by the difference between the
    calling conventions for the HTML shortcuts, which require curly braces
    around the HTML tag attributes, and the calling conventions for other
    routines, which manage to generate attributes without the curly brackets.
    Don't be confused. As a convenience the curly braces are optional in all but
    the HTML shortcuts. If you like, you can use curly braces when calling any
    routine that takes named arguments. For example:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
   print $q-&gt;header( {-type=&gt;'image/gif',-expires=&gt;'+3d'} );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If you use the <b>-w</b> switch, you will be warned that some
    CGI.pm argument names conflict with built-in Perl functions. The most
    frequent of these is the -values argument, used to create multi-valued
    menus, radio button clusters and the like. To get around this warning, you
    have several choices:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>1.</dt>
  <dd>Use another name for the argument, if one is available. For example,
      -value is an alias for -values.</dd>
  <dt>2.</dt>
  <dd>Change the capitalization, e.g. -Values</dd>
  <dt>3.</dt>
  <dd>Put quotes around the argument name, e.g. '-values'</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Many routines will do something useful with a named argument that
    it doesn't recognize. For example, you can produce non-standard HTTP header
    fields by providing them as named arguments:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  print $q-&gt;header(-type  =&gt;  'text/html',
                   -cost  =&gt;  'Three smackers',
                   -annoyance_level =&gt; 'high',
                   -complaints_to   =&gt; 'bit bucket');
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This will produce the following nonstandard HTTP header:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
   HTTP/1.0 200 OK
   Cost: Three smackers
   Annoyance-level: high
   Complaints-to: bit bucket
   Content-type: text/html
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Notice the way that underscores are translated automatically into
    hyphens. HTML-generating routines perform a different type of
  translation.</p>
<p class="Pp">This feature allows you to keep up with the rapidly changing HTTP
    and HTML &quot;standards&quot;.</p>

<p class="Pp">Many people want to fetch the entire parameter list as a hash in
    which the keys are the names of the CGI parameters, and the values are the
    parameters' values. The <i>Vars()</i> method does this. Called in a scalar
    context, it returns the parameter list as a tied hash reference. Changing a
    key changes the value of the parameter in the underlying CGI parameter list.
    Called in a list context, it returns the parameter list as an ordinary hash.
    This allows you to read the contents of the parameter list, but not to
    change it.</p>
<p class="Pp">When using this, the thing you must watch out for are multivalued
    CGI parameters. Because a hash cannot distinguish between scalar and list
    context, multivalued parameters will be returned as a packed string,
    separated by the &quot;\0&quot; (null) character. You must split this packed
    string in order to get at the individual values. This is the convention
    introduced long ago by Steve Brenner in his cgi-lib.pl module for Perl
    version 4.</p>

Errors can occur while processing user input, particularly when processing

  an empty parameter list. You can test for the existence and nature of errors
  using the <i></i><i>cgi_error()</i><i></i> function. The error messages are
  formatted as HTTP status codes. You can either incorporate the error text into
  an HTML page, or use it as the value of the HTTP status:
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>

  THE FUNCTION-ORIENTED INTERFACE</a></h2>
To use the function-oriented interface, you must specify which CGI.pm routines
  or sets of routines to import into your script's namespace. There is a small
  overhead associated with this importation, but it isn't much.
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
   use CGI &lt;list of methods&gt;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The listed methods will be imported into the current package; you
    can call them directly without creating a CGI object first. This example
    shows how to import the <b></b><b><i>param()</i></b><b></b> and
    <b></b><b><i>header()</i></b><b></b> methods, and then use them
  directly:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
   use CGI 'param','header';
   print header('text/plain');
   $zipcode = param('zipcode');
</pre>
<p class="Pp">More frequently, you'll import common sets of functions by
    referring to the groups by name. All function sets are preceded with a
    &quot;:&quot; character as in &quot;:html3&quot; (for tags defined in the
    HTML 3 standard).</p>
<p class="Pp">Here is a list of the function sets you can import:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>:cgi</b></dt>
  <dd>Import all CGI-handling methods, such as
      <b></b><b><i>param()</i></b><b></b>,
      <b></b><b><i>path_info()</i></b><b></b> and the like.</dd>
  <dt><b>:form</b></dt>
  <dd>Import all fill-out form generating methods, such as
      <b></b><b><i>textfield()</i></b><b></b>.</dd>
  <dt><b>:html2</b></dt>
  <dd>Import all methods that generate HTML 2.0 standard elements.</dd>
  <dt><b>:html3</b></dt>
  <dd>Import all methods that generate HTML 3.0 elements (such as &lt;table&gt;,
      &lt;super&gt; and &lt;sub&gt;).</dd>
  <dt><b>:html4</b></dt>
  <dd>Import all methods that generate HTML 4 elements (such as &lt;abbrev&gt;,
      &lt;acronym&gt; and &lt;thead&gt;).</dd>
  <dt><b>:netscape</b></dt>
  <dd>Import the &lt;blink&gt;, &lt;fontsize&gt; and &lt;center&gt; tags.</dd>
  <dt><b>:html</b></dt>
  <dd>Import all HTML-generating shortcuts (i.e. 'html2', 'html3', 'html4' and
      'netscape')</dd>
  <dt><b>:standard</b></dt>
  <dd>Import &quot;standard&quot; features, 'html2', 'html3', 'html4', 'form'
      and 'cgi'.</dd>
  <dt><b>:all</b></dt>
  <dd>Import all the available methods. For the full list, see the CGI.pm code,
      where the variable <span class="Li">%EXPORT_TAGS</span> is defined.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">If you import a function name that is not part of CGI.pm, the
    module will treat it as a new HTML tag and generate the appropriate
    subroutine. You can then use it like any other HTML tag. This is to provide
    for the rapidly-evolving HTML &quot;standard.&quot; For example, say
    Microsoft comes out with a new tag called &lt;gradient&gt; (which causes the
    user's desktop to be flooded with a rotating gradient fill until his machine
    reboots). You don't need to wait for a new version of CGI.pm to start using
    it immediately:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
   use CGI qw/:standard :html3 gradient/;
   print gradient({-start=&gt;'red',-end=&gt;'blue'});
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Note that in the interests of execution speed CGI.pm does
    <b>not</b> use the standard Exporter syntax for specifying load symbols.
    This may change in the future.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you import any of the state-maintaining CGI or form-generating
    methods, a default CGI object will be created and initialized automatically
    the first time you use any of the methods that require one to be present.
    This includes <b></b><b><i>param()</i></b><b></b>,
    <b></b><b><i>textfield()</i></b> <b></b>,
    <b></b><b><i>submit()</i></b><b></b> and the like. (If you need direct
    access to the CGI object, you can find it in the global variable
    <b></b><b>$CGI::Q</b><b></b>). By importing CGI.pm methods, you can create
    visually elegant scripts:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
   use CGI qw/:standard/;
   print 
       header,
       start_html('Simple Script'),
       h1('Simple Script'),
       start_form,
       &quot;What's your name? &quot;,textfield('name'),p,
       &quot;What's the combination?&quot;,
       checkbox_group(-name=&gt;'words',
                      -values=&gt;['eenie','meenie','minie','moe'],
                      -defaults=&gt;['eenie','moe']),p,
       &quot;What's your favorite color?&quot;,
       popup_menu(-name=&gt;'color',
                  -values=&gt;['red','green','blue','chartreuse']),p,
       submit,
       end_form,
       hr,&quot;\n&quot;;

    if (param) {
       print 
           &quot;Your name is &quot;,em(param('name')),p,
           &quot;The keywords are: &quot;,em(join(&quot;, &quot;,param('words'))),p,
           &quot;Your favorite color is &quot;,em(param('color')),&quot;.\n&quot;;

<h2 class="Ss" id="_s-1PRAGMAS_s0"><a class="permalink" href="#_s-1PRAGMAS_s0">PRAGMAS</a></h2>
In addition to the function sets, there are a number of pragmas that you can
  import. Pragmas, which are always preceded by a hyphen, change the way that
  CGI.pm functions in various ways. Pragmas, function sets, and individual
  functions can all be imported in the same <i>use()</i> line. For example, the
  following use statement imports the standard set of functions and enables
  debugging mode (pragma -debug):
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
   use CGI qw/:standard -debug/;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The current list of pragmas is as follows:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>-any</dt>
  <dd>When you <i>use CGI -any</i>, then any method that the query object
      doesn't recognize will be interpreted as a new HTML tag. This allows you
      to support the next <i>ad hoc</i> HTML extension. This lets you go wild
      with new and unsupported tags:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
   use CGI qw(-any);
   $q=CGI-&gt;new;
   print $q-&gt;gradient({speed=&gt;'fast',start=&gt;'red',end=&gt;'blue'});
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Since using &lt;cite&gt;any&lt;/cite&gt; causes any mistyped
        method name to be interpreted as an HTML tag, use it with care or not at
        all.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>-compile</dt>
  <dd>This causes the indicated autoloaded methods to be compiled up front,
      rather than deferred to later. This is useful for scripts that run for an
      extended period of time under FastCGI or mod_perl, and for those destined
      to be crunched by Malcolm Beattie's Perl compiler. Use it in conjunction
      with the methods or method families you plan to use.
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
   use CGI qw(-compile :standard :html3);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">or even</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
   use CGI qw(-compile :all);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Note that using the -compile pragma in this way will always
        have the effect of importing the compiled functions into the current
        namespace. If you want to compile without importing use the
        <i>compile()</i> method instead:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
   use CGI();
   CGI-&gt;compile();
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This is particularly useful in a mod_perl environment, in
        which you might want to precompile all CGI routines in a startup script,
        and then import the functions individually in each mod_perl script.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>-nosticky</dt>
  <dd>By default the CGI module implements a state-preserving behavior called
      &quot;sticky&quot; fields. The way this works is that if you are
      regenerating a form, the methods that generate the form field values will
      interrogate <i>param()</i> to see if similarly-named parameters are
      present in the query string. If they find a like-named parameter, they
      will use it to set their default values.
    <p class="Pp">Sometimes this isn't what you want. The <b>-nosticky</b>
        pragma prevents this behavior. You can also selectively change the
        sticky behavior in each element that you generate.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>-tabindex</dt>
  <dd>Automatically add tab index attributes to each form field. With this
      option turned off, you can still add tab indexes manually by passing a
      -tabindex option to each field-generating method.</dd>
  <dt>-no_undef_params</dt>
  <dd>This keeps CGI.pm from including undef params in the parameter list.</dd>
  <dt>-no_xhtml</dt>
  <dd>By default, CGI.pm versions 2.69 and higher emit XHTML
      (http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/). The -no_xhtml pragma disables this
      feature. Thanks to Michalis Kabrianis &lt;kabrianis@hellug.gr&gt; for this
      feature.
    <p class="Pp">If <i>start_html()</i>'s -dtd parameter specifies an HTML 2.0,
        3.2, 4.0 or 4.01 DTD, XHTML will automatically be disabled without
        needing to use this pragma.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>-utf8</dt>
  <dd>This makes CGI.pm treat all parameters as UTF-8 strings. Use this with
      care, as it will interfere with the processing of binary uploads. It is
      better to manually select which fields are expected to return utf-8
      strings and convert them using code like this:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
 use Encode;
 my $arg = decode utf8=&gt;param('foo');
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>-nph</dt>
  <dd>This makes CGI.pm produce a header appropriate for an NPH (no parsed
      header) script. You may need to do other things as well to tell the server
      that the script is NPH. See the discussion of NPH scripts below.</dd>
  <dt>-newstyle_urls</dt>
  <dd>Separate the name=value pairs in CGI parameter query strings with
      semicolons rather than ampersands. For example:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
   ?name=fred;age=24;favorite_color=3
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Semicolon-delimited query strings are always accepted, and
        will be emitted by <i>self_url()</i> and <i>query_string()</i>.
        newstyle_urls became the default in version 2.64.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>-oldstyle_urls</dt>
  <dd>Separate the name=value pairs in CGI parameter query strings with
      ampersands rather than semicolons. This is no longer the default.</dd>
  <dt>-autoload</dt>
  <dd>This overrides the autoloader so that any function in your program that is
      not recognized is referred to CGI.pm for possible evaluation. This allows
      you to use all the CGI.pm functions without adding them to your symbol
      table, which is of concern for mod_perl users who are worried about memory
      consumption. <i>Warning:</i> when <i>-autoload</i> is in effect, you
      cannot use &quot;poetry mode&quot; (functions without the parenthesis).
      Use <i></i><i>hr()</i><i></i> rather than <i>hr</i>, or add something like
      <i>use subs qw/hr p header/</i> to the top of your script.</dd>
  <dt>-no_debug</dt>
  <dd>This turns off the command-line processing features. If you want to run a
      CGI.pm script from the command line to produce HTML, and you don't want it
      to read CGI parameters from the command line or STDIN, then use this
      pragma:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
   use CGI qw(-no_debug :standard);
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>-debug</dt>
  <dd>This turns on full debugging. In addition to reading CGI arguments from
      the command-line processing, CGI.pm will pause and try to read arguments
      from STDIN, producing the message &quot;(offline mode: enter name=value
      pairs on standard input)&quot; features.
    <p class="Pp">See the section on debugging for more details.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>-private_tempfiles</dt>
  <dd>CGI.pm can process uploaded file. Ordinarily it spools the uploaded file
      to a temporary directory, then deletes the file when done. However, this
      opens the risk of eavesdropping as described in the file upload section.
      Another CGI script author could peek at this data during the upload, even
      if it is confidential information. On Unix systems, the -private_tempfiles
      pragma will cause the temporary file to be unlinked as soon as it is
      opened and before any data is written into it, reducing, but not
      eliminating the risk of eavesdropping (there is still a potential race
      condition). To make life harder for the attacker, the program chooses
      tempfile names by calculating a 32 bit checksum of the incoming HTTP
      headers.
    <p class="Pp">To ensure that the temporary file cannot be read by other CGI
        scripts, use suEXEC or a CGI wrapper program to run your script. The
        temporary file is created with mode 0600 (neither world nor group
        readable).</p>
    <p class="Pp">The temporary directory is selected using the following
        algorithm:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    1. if $CGITempFile::TMPDIRECTORY is already set, use that

    2. if the environment variable TMPDIR exists, use the location
    indicated.

    3. Otherwise try the locations /usr/tmp, /var/tmp, C:\temp,
    /tmp, /temp, ::Temporary Items, and \WWW_ROOT.
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Each of these locations is checked that it is a directory and
        is writable. If not, the algorithm tries the next choice.</p>

Most of CGI.pm's functions deal with creating documents on the fly. Generally
  you will produce the HTTP header first, followed by the document itself.
  CGI.pm provides functions for generating HTTP headers of various types as well
  as for generating HTML. For creating GIF images, see the GD.pm module.
<p class="Pp">Each of these functions produces a fragment of HTML or HTTP which

Normally the first thing you will do in any CGI script is print out an HTTP
  header. This tells the browser what type of document to expect, and gives
  other optional information, such as the language, expiration date, and whether
  to cache the document. The header can also be manipulated for special

</pre>
<p class="Pp"><i>header()</i> returns the Content-type: header. You can provide
    your own MIME type if you choose, otherwise it defaults to text/html. An
    optional second parameter specifies the status code and a human-readable
    message. For example, you can specify 204, &quot;No response&quot; to create
    a script that tells the browser to do nothing at all. Note that RFC 2616
    expects the human-readable phase to be there as well as the numeric status
    code.</p>
<p class="Pp">The last example shows the named argument style for passing
    arguments to the CGI methods using named parameters. Recognized parameters
    are <b>-type</b>, <b>-status</b>, <b>-expires</b>, and <b>-cookie</b>. Any
    other named parameters will be stripped of their initial hyphens and turned
    into header fields, allowing you to specify any HTTP header you desire.
    Internal underscores will be turned into hyphens:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    print header(-Content_length=&gt;3002);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Most browsers will not cache the output from CGI scripts. Every
    time the browser reloads the page, the script is invoked anew. You can
    change this behavior with the <b>-expires</b> parameter. When you specify an
    absolute or relative expiration interval with this parameter, some browsers
    and proxy servers will cache the script's output until the indicated
    expiration date. The following forms are all valid for the -expires
  field:</p>

</pre>
<p class="Pp">The <b>-cookie</b> parameter generates a header that tells the
    browser to provide a &quot;magic cookie&quot; during all subsequent
    transactions with your script. Some cookies have a special format that
    includes interesting attributes such as expiration time. Use the
    <i>cookie()</i> method to create and retrieve session cookies.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>-nph</b> parameter, if set to a true value, will issue the
    correct headers to work with a NPH (no-parse-header) script. This is
    important to use with certain servers that expect all their scripts to be
    NPH.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>-charset</b> parameter can be used to control the character
    set sent to the browser. If not provided, defaults to ISO-8859-1. As a side
    effect, this sets the <i>charset()</i> method as well.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>-attachment</b> parameter can be used to turn the page into
    an attachment. Instead of displaying the page, some browsers will prompt the
    user to save it to disk. The value of the argument is the suggested name for
    the saved file. In order for this to work, you may have to set the
    <b>-type</b> to &quot;application/octet-stream&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>-p3p</b> parameter will add a P3P tag to the outgoing
    header. The parameter can be an arrayref or a space-delimited string of P3P
    tags. For example:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
   print header(-p3p=&gt;[qw(CAO DSP LAW CURa)]);
   print header(-p3p=&gt;'CAO DSP LAW CURa');
</pre>
<p class="Pp">In either case, the outgoing header will be formatted as:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  P3P: policyref=&quot;/w3c/p3p.xml&quot; cp=&quot;CAO DSP LAW CURa&quot;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">CGI.pm will accept valid multi-line headers when each line is
    separated with a CRLF value (&quot;\r\n&quot; on most platforms) followed by
    at least one space. For example:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    print header( -ingredients =&gt; &quot;ham\r\n\seggs\r\n\sbacon&quot; );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Invalid multi-line header input will trigger in an exception. When
    multi-line headers are received, CGI.pm will always output them back as a
    single line, according to the folding rules of RFC 2616: the newlines will
    be removed, while the white space remains.</p>

<span class="Li"></span>
<pre>
   print $q-&gt;redirect('http://somewhere.else/in/movie/land');
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Sometimes you don't want to produce a document yourself, but
    simply redirect the browser elsewhere, perhaps choosing a URL based on the
    time of day or the identity of the user.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>redirect()</i> method redirects the browser to a different
    URL. If you use redirection like this, you should <b>not</b> print out a
    header as well.</p>
<p class="Pp">You should always use full URLs (including the http: or ftp: part)
    in redirection requests. Relative URLs will not work correctly.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can also use named arguments:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    print $q-&gt;redirect(
        -uri=&gt;'http://somewhere.else/in/movie/land',
            -nph=&gt;1,
         -status=&gt;'301 Moved Permanently');
</pre>
<p class="Pp">All names arguments recognized by <i>header()</i> are also
    recognized by <i>redirect()</i>. However, most HTTP headers, including those
    generated by -cookie and -target, are ignored by the browser.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>-nph</b> parameter, if set to a true value, will issue the
    correct headers to work with a NPH (no-parse-header) script. This is
    important to use with certain servers, such as Microsoft IIS, which expect
    all their scripts to be NPH.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>-status</b> parameter will set the status of the redirect.
    HTTP defines three different possible redirection status codes:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
     301 Moved Permanently
     302 Found
     303 See Other
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The default if not specified is 302, which means &quot;moved
    temporarily.&quot; You may change the status to another status code if you
    wish. Be advised that changing the status to anything other than 301, 302 or
    303 will probably break redirection.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that the human-readable phrase is also expected to be present
    to conform with RFC 2616, section 6.1.</p>

</pre>
<p class="Pp">The <i>start_html()</i> routine creates the top of the page, along
    with a lot of optional information that controls the page's appearance and
    behavior.</p>
<p class="Pp">This method returns a canned HTML header and the opening
    &lt;body&gt; tag. All parameters are optional. In the named parameter form,
    recognized parameters are -title, -author, -base, -xbase, -dtd, -lang and
    -target (see below for the explanation). Any additional parameters you
    provide, such as the unofficial BGCOLOR attribute, are added to the
    &lt;body&gt; tag. Additional parameters must be proceeded by a hyphen.</p>
<p class="Pp">The argument <b>-xbase</b> allows you to provide an HREF for the
    &lt;base&gt; tag different from the current location, as in</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    -xbase=&gt;&quot;http://home.mcom.com/&quot;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">All relative links will be interpreted relative to this tag.</p>
<p class="Pp">The argument <b>-target</b> allows you to provide a default target
    frame for all the links and fill-out forms on the page. <b>This is a</b>
    <b>non-standard HTTP feature which only works with some browsers!</b></p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    -target=&gt;&quot;answer_window&quot;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">All relative links will be interpreted relative to this tag. You
    add arbitrary meta information to the header with the <b>-meta</b> argument.
    This argument expects a reference to a hash containing name/value pairs of
    meta information. These will be turned into a series of header &lt;meta&gt;
    tags that look something like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    &lt;meta name=&quot;keywords&quot; content=&quot;pharaoh secret mummy&quot;&gt;
    &lt;meta name=&quot;description&quot; content=&quot;copyright 1996 King Tut&quot;&gt;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">To create an HTTP-EQUIV type of &lt;meta&gt; tag, use
    <b>-head</b>, described below.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>-style</b> argument is used to incorporate cascading
    stylesheets into your code. See the section on CASCADING STYLESHEETS for
    more information.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>-lang</b> argument is used to incorporate a language
    attribute into the &lt;html&gt; tag. For example:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    print $q-&gt;start_html(-lang=&gt;'fr-CA');
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The default if not specified is &quot;en-US&quot; for US English,
    unless the -dtd parameter specifies an HTML 2.0 or 3.2 DTD, in which case
    the lang attribute is left off. You can force the lang attribute to left off
    in other cases by passing an empty string (-lang=&gt;'').</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>-encoding</b> argument can be used to specify the character
    set for XHTML. It defaults to iso-8859-1 if not specified.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>-dtd</b> argument can be used to specify a public DTD
    identifier string. For example:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    -dtd =&gt; '-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN')
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Alternatively, it can take public and system DTD identifiers as an
    array:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    dtd =&gt; [ '-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN', 'http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd' ]
</pre>
<p class="Pp">For the public DTD identifier to be considered, it must be valid.
    Otherwise it will be replaced by the default DTD. If the public DTD contains
    'XHTML', CGI.pm will emit XML.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>-declare_xml</b> argument, when used in conjunction with
    XHTML, will put a &lt;?xml&gt; declaration at the top of the HTML header.
    The sole purpose of this declaration is to declare the character set
    encoding. In the absence of -declare_xml, the output HTML will contain a
    &lt;meta&gt; tag that specifies the encoding, allowing the HTML to pass most
    validators. The default for -declare_xml is false.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can place other arbitrary HTML elements to the &lt;head&gt;
    section with the <b>-head</b> tag. For example, to place a &lt;link&gt;
    element in the head section, use this:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    print start_html(-head=&gt;Link({-rel=&gt;'shortcut icon',
                                  -href=&gt;'favicon.ico'}));
</pre>
<p class="Pp">To incorporate multiple HTML elements into the &lt;head&gt;
    section, just pass an array reference:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    print start_html(-head=&gt;[ 
                             Link({-rel=&gt;'next',
                                   -href=&gt;'http://www.capricorn.com/s2.html'}),
                             Link({-rel=&gt;'previous',
                                   -href=&gt;'http://www.capricorn.com/s1.html'})
                             ]
                     );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">And here's how to create an HTTP-EQUIV &lt;meta&gt; tag:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
      print start_html(-head=&gt;meta({-http_equiv =&gt; 'Content-Type',
                                    -content    =&gt; 'text/html'}))
</pre>
<p class="Pp">JAVASCRIPTING: The <b>-script</b>, <b>-noScript</b>,
    <b>-onLoad</b>, <b>-onMouseOver</b>, <b>-onMouseOut</b> and <b>-onUnload</b>
    parameters are used to add JavaScript calls to your pages. <b>-script</b>
    should point to a block of text containing JavaScript function definitions.
    This block will be placed within a &lt;script&gt; block inside the HTML (not
    HTTP) header. The block is placed in the header in order to give your page a
    fighting chance of having all its JavaScript functions in place even if the
    user presses the stop button before the page has loaded completely. CGI.pm
    attempts to format the script in such a way that JavaScript-naive browsers
    will not choke on the code: unfortunately there are some browsers, such as
    Chimera for Unix, that get confused by it nevertheless.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>-onLoad</b> and <b>-onUnload</b> parameters point to
    fragments of JavaScript code to execute when the page is respectively opened
    and closed by the browser. Usually these parameters are calls to functions
    defined in the <b>-script</b> field:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
      $query = CGI-&gt;new;
      print header;
      $JSCRIPT=&lt;&lt;END;

                       &quot;and three legs in the evening?&quot;);
         response(r);
      }
      // Get a silly answer
      function response(answer) {
         if (answer == &quot;man&quot;)
            alert(&quot;Right you are!&quot;);
         else

      print start_html(-title=&gt;'The Riddle of the Sphinx',
                               -script=&gt;$JSCRIPT);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Use the <b>-noScript</b> parameter to pass some HTML text that
    will be displayed on browsers that do not have JavaScript (or browsers where
    JavaScript is turned off).</p>
<p class="Pp">The &lt;script&gt; tag, has several attributes including
    &quot;type&quot;, &quot;charset&quot; and &quot;src&quot;. &quot;src&quot;
    allows you to keep JavaScript code in an external file. To use these
    attributes pass a HASH reference in the <b>-script</b> parameter containing
    one or more of -type, -src, or -code:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>

<p class="Pp">A final feature allows you to incorporate multiple &lt;script&gt;
    sections into the header. Just pass the list of script sections as an array

<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>

<p class="Pp">It is possible for a script to receive CGI parameters in the URL
    as well as in the fill-out form by creating a form that POSTs to a URL
    containing a query string (a &quot;?&quot; mark followed by arguments). The
    <b></b><b><i>param()</i></b><b></b> method will always return the contents
    of the POSTed fill-out form, ignoring the URL's query string. To retrieve
    URL parameters, call the <b></b><b><i>url_param()</i></b><b></b> method. Use
    it in the same way as <b></b><b><i>param()</i></b><b></b>. The main
    difference is that it allows you to read the parameters, but not set
  them.</p>

    interfere with similarly-named CGI parameters in POSTed forms. If you try to

<h1 class="Sh" id="CREATING_STANDARD_HTML_ELEMENTS:"><a class="permalink" href="#CREATING_STANDARD_HTML_ELEMENTS:">CREATING
  STANDARD HTML ELEMENTS:</a></h1>
CGI.pm defines general HTML shortcut methods for many HTML tags. HTML shortcuts
  are named after a single HTML element and return a fragment of HTML text.
  Example:
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
   print $q-&gt;blockquote(
                     &quot;Many years ago on the island of&quot;,
                     $q-&gt;a({href=&gt;&quot;http://crete.org/&quot;},&quot;Crete&quot;),
                     &quot;there lived a Minotaur named&quot;,
                     $q-&gt;strong(&quot;Fred.&quot;),
                    ),
       $q-&gt;hr;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This results in the following HTML code (extra newlines have been
    added for readability):</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
   &lt;blockquote&gt;
   Many years ago on the island of
   &lt;a href=&quot;http://crete.org/&quot;&gt;Crete&lt;/a&gt; there lived
   a minotaur named &lt;strong&gt;Fred.&lt;/strong&gt; 
   &lt;/blockquote&gt;
   &lt;hr&gt;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If you find the syntax for calling the HTML shortcuts awkward, you
    can import them into your namespace and dispense with the object syntax
    completely (see the next section for more details):</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
   use CGI ':standard';
   print blockquote(
      &quot;Many years ago on the island of&quot;,
      a({href=&gt;&quot;http://crete.org/&quot;},&quot;Crete&quot;),

<h2 class="Ss" id="_s-1PROVIDING_ARGUMENTS_TO_HTML_SHORTCUTS_s0"><a class="permalink" href="#_s-1PROVIDING_ARGUMENTS_TO_HTML_SHORTCUTS_s0">PROVIDING
  ARGUMENTS TO HTML SHORTCUTS</a></h2>
The HTML methods will accept zero, one or multiple arguments. If you provide no
  arguments, you get a single tag:
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
   print hr;    #  &lt;hr&gt;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If you provide one or more string arguments, they are concatenated
    together with spaces and placed between opening and closing tags:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
   print h1(&quot;Chapter&quot;,&quot;1&quot;); # &lt;h1&gt;Chapter 1&lt;/h1&gt;&quot;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If the first argument is a hash reference, then the keys and
    values of the hash become the HTML tag's attributes:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
   print a({-href=&gt;'fred.html',-target=&gt;'_new'},
      &quot;Open a new frame&quot;);

            &lt;a href=&quot;fred.html&quot;,target=&quot;_new&quot;&gt;Open a new frame&lt;/a&gt;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">You may dispense with the dashes in front of the attribute names
    if you prefer:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
   print img {src=&gt;'fred.gif',align=&gt;'LEFT'};

           &lt;img align=&quot;LEFT&quot; src=&quot;fred.gif&quot;&gt;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Sometimes an HTML tag attribute has no argument. For example,
    ordered lists can be marked as COMPACT. The syntax for this is an argument
    that that points to an undef string:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
   print ol({compact=&gt;undef},li('one'),li('two'),li('three'));
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Prior to CGI.pm version 2.41, providing an empty ('') string as an
    attribute argument was the same as providing undef. However, this has
    changed in order to accommodate those who want to create tags of the form
    &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;. The difference is shown in these two pieces of
    code:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
   CODE                   RESULT
   img({alt=&gt;undef})      &lt;img alt&gt;
   img({alt=&gt;''})         &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;

  DISTRIBUTIVE PROPERTY OF HTML SHORTCUTS</a></h2>
One of the cool features of the HTML shortcuts is that they are distributive. If
  you give them an argument consisting of a <b>reference</b> to a list, the tag
  will be distributed across each element of the list. For example, here's one
  way to make an ordered list:
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
   print ul(
             li({-type=&gt;'disc'},['Sneezy','Doc','Sleepy','Happy'])
           );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This example will result in HTML output that looks like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
   &lt;ul&gt;
     &lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;Sneezy&lt;/li&gt;
     &lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;Doc&lt;/li&gt;
     &lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;Sleepy&lt;/li&gt;
     &lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;Happy&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;/ul&gt;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This is extremely useful for creating tables. For example:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
   print table({-border=&gt;undef},
           caption('When Should You Eat Your Vegetables?'),
           Tr({-align=&gt;'CENTER',-valign=&gt;'TOP'},
           [
              th(['Vegetable', 'Breakfast','Lunch','Dinner']),
              td(['Tomatoes' , 'no', 'yes', 'yes']),
              td(['Broccoli' , 'no', 'no',  'yes']),
              td(['Onions'   , 'yes','yes', 'yes'])
           ]
           )
        );

Consider this bit of code:
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
   print blockquote(em('Hi'),'mom!'));
</pre>
<p class="Pp">It will ordinarily return the string that you probably expect,

</pre>
<p class="Pp">Note the space between the element &quot;Hi&quot; and the element
    &quot;mom!&quot;. CGI.pm puts the extra space there using array
    interpolation, which is controlled by the magic $&quot; variable. Sometimes
    this extra space is not what you want, for example, when you are trying to
    align a series of images. In this case, you can simply change the value of
    $&quot; to an empty string.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
   {
      local($&quot;) = '';
      print blockquote(em('Hi'),'mom!'));
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">I suggest you put the code in a block as shown here. Otherwise the

<h2 class="Ss" id="_s-1AUTOESCAPING_HTML_s0"><a class="permalink" href="#_s-1AUTOESCAPING_HTML_s0">AUTOESCAPING
  HTML</a></h2>
By default, all HTML that is emitted by the form-generating functions is passed
  through a function called <i>escapeHTML()</i>:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>$escaped_string = escapeHTML(&quot;unescaped string&quot;);</dt>
  <dd>Escape HTML formatting characters in a string.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Provided that you have specified a character set of ISO-8859-1
    (the default), the standard HTML escaping rules will be used. The
    &quot;&lt;&quot; character becomes &quot;&amp;lt;&quot;, &quot;&gt;&quot;
    becomes &quot;&amp;gt;&quot;, &quot;&amp;&quot; becomes
    &quot;&amp;amp;&quot;, and the quote character becomes
    &quot;&amp;quot;&quot;. In addition, the hexadecimal 0x8b and 0x9b
    characters, which some browsers incorrectly interpret as the left and right
    angle-bracket characters, are replaced by their numeric character entities
    (&quot;&amp;#8249&quot; and &quot;&amp;#8250;&quot;). If you manually change
    the charset, either by calling the <i>charset()</i> method explicitly or by
    passing a -charset argument to <i>header()</i>, then <b>all</b> characters
    will be replaced by their numeric entities, since CGI.pm has no lookup table
    for all the possible encodings.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;escapeHTML()&quot;</span> expects the
    supplied string to be a character string. This means you should
    Encode::decode data received from &quot;outside&quot; and Encode::encode
    your strings before sending them back outside. If your source code UTF-8
    encoded and you want to upgrade string literals in your source to character
    strings, you can use &quot;use utf8&quot;. See perlunitut, perlunifaq and
    perlunicode for more information on how Perl handles the difference between
    bytes and characters.</p>
<p class="Pp">The automatic escaping does not apply to other shortcuts, such as
    <i>h1()</i>. You should call <i>escapeHTML()</i> yourself on untrusted data
    in order to protect your pages against nasty tricks that people may enter
    into guestbooks, etc.. To change the character set, use <i>charset()</i>. To
    turn autoescaping off completely, use <i>autoEscape</i>(0):</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>$charset = charset([$charset]);</dt>
  <dd>Get or set the current character set.</dd>
  <dt>$flag = autoEscape([$flag]);</dt>
  <dd>Get or set the value of the autoescape flag.</dd>

<h1 class="Sh" id="CREATING_FILL-OUT_FORMS:"><a class="permalink" href="#CREATING_FILL-OUT_FORMS:">CREATING
  FILL-OUT FORMS:</a></h1>
<i>General note</i> The various form-creating methods all return strings to the
  caller, containing the tag or tags that will create the requested form
  element. You are responsible for actually printing out these strings. It's set
  up this way so that you can place formatting tags around the form elements.
<p class="Pp"><i>Another note</i> The default values that you specify for the
    forms are only used the <b>first</b> time the script is invoked (when there
    is no query string). On subsequent invocations of the script (when there is
    a query string), the former values are used even if they are blank.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you want to change the value of a field from its previous
    value, you have two choices:</p>
<p class="Pp">(1) call the <i>param()</i> method to set it.</p>
<p class="Pp">(2) use the -override (alias -force) parameter (a new feature in
    version 2.15). This forces the default value to be used, regardless of the
    previous value:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
   print textfield(-name=&gt;'field_name',
                           -default=&gt;'starting value',
                           -override=&gt;1,
                           -size=&gt;50,
                           -maxlength=&gt;80);
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><i>Yet another note</i> By default, the text and labels of form
    elements are escaped according to HTML rules. This means that you can safely
    use &quot;&lt;CLICK ME&gt;&quot; as the label for a button. However, it also
    interferes with your ability to incorporate special HTML character
    sequences, such as &amp;Aacute;, into your fields. If you wish to turn off
    automatic escaping, call the <i>autoEscape()</i> method with a false value
    immediately after creating the CGI object:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
   $query = CGI-&gt;new;
   $query-&gt;autoEscape(0);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Note that <i>autoEscape()</i> is exclusively used to effect the
    behavior of how some CGI.pm HTML generation functions handle escaping.
    Calling <i>escapeHTML()</i> explicitly will always escape the HTML.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>A Lurking Trap!</i> Some of the form-element generating methods
    return multiple tags. In a scalar context, the tags will be concatenated
    together with spaces, or whatever is the current value of the $&quot;
    global. In a list context, the methods will return a list of elements,
    allowing you to modify them if you wish. Usually you will not notice this
    behavior, but beware of this:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    printf(&quot;%s\n&quot;,end_form())
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><i>end_form()</i> produces several tags, and only the first of
    them will be printed because the format only expects one value.</p>

<p class="Pp">JAVASCRIPTING: The <b>-name</b> and <b>-onSubmit</b> parameters
    are provided for use with JavaScript. The -name parameter gives the form a
    name so that it can be identified and manipulated by JavaScript functions.
    -onSubmit should point to a JavaScript function that will be executed just
    before the form is submitted to your server. You can use this opportunity to
    check the contents of the form for consistency and completeness. If you find
    something wrong, you can put up an alert box or maybe fix things up
    yourself. You can abort the submission by returning false from this
    function.</p>
<p class="Pp">Usually the bulk of JavaScript functions are defined in a

After starting a form, you will typically create one or more textfields, popup

  standard set of named arguments. Some elements also have optional arguments.
  The standard arguments are as follows:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>-name</b></dt>
  <dd>The name of the field. After submission this name can be used to retrieve

<h2 class="Ss" id="_s-1PROCESSING_A_FILE_UPLOAD_FIELD_s0"><a class="permalink" href="#_s-1PROCESSING_A_FILE_UPLOAD_FIELD_s0">PROCESSING
  A FILE UPLOAD FIELD</a></h2>
<i>Basics</i>
<p class="Pp">When the form is processed, you can retrieve an IO::Handle
    compatible handle for a file upload field like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  $lightweight_fh  = $q-&gt;upload('field_name');

  # undef may be returned if it's not a valid file handle
  if (defined $lightweight_fh) {
    # Upgrade the handle to one compatible with IO::Handle:
    my $io_handle = $lightweight_fh-&gt;handle;

    open (OUTFILE,'&gt;&gt;','/usr/local/web/users/feedback');
    while ($bytesread = $io_handle-&gt;read($buffer,1024)) {
      print OUTFILE $buffer;
    }
  }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">In a list context, <i>upload()</i> will return an array of
    filehandles. This makes it possible to process forms that use the same name
    for multiple upload fields.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you want the entered file name for the file, you can just call
    <i>param()</i>:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  $filename = $q-&gt;param('field_name');
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Different browsers will return slightly different things for the
    name. Some browsers return the filename only. Others return the full path to
    the file, using the path conventions of the user's machine. Regardless, the
    name returned is always the name of the file on the <i>user's</i> machine,
    and is unrelated to the name of the temporary file that CGI.pm creates
    during upload spooling (see below).</p>
<p class="Pp">When a file is uploaded the browser usually sends along some
    information along with it in the format of headers. The information usually
    includes the MIME content type. To retrieve this information, call
    <i>uploadInfo()</i>. It returns a reference to a hash containing all the
    document headers.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
       $filename = $q-&gt;param('uploaded_file');
       $type = $q-&gt;uploadInfo($filename)-&gt;{'Content-Type'};
       unless ($type eq 'text/html') {
        die &quot;HTML FILES ONLY!&quot;;
       }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If you are using a machine that recognizes &quot;text&quot; and
    &quot;binary&quot; data modes, be sure to understand when and how to use
    them (see the Camel book). Otherwise you may find that binary files are
    corrupted during file uploads.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Accessing the temp files directly</i></p>
<p class="Pp">When processing an uploaded file, CGI.pm creates a temporary file
    on your hard disk and passes you a file handle to that file. After you are
    finished with the file handle, CGI.pm unlinks (deletes) the temporary file.
    If you need to you can access the temporary file directly. You can access
    the temp file for a file upload by passing the file name to the
    <i>tmpFileName()</i> method:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
       $filename = $query-&gt;param('uploaded_file');
       $tmpfilename = $query-&gt;tmpFileName($filename);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The temporary file will be deleted automatically when your program
    exits unless you manually rename it. On some operating systems (such as
    Windows NT), you will need to close the temporary file's filehandle before
    your program exits. Otherwise the attempt to delete the temporary file will
    fail.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Handling interrupted file uploads</i></p>
<p class="Pp">There are occasionally problems involving parsing the uploaded
    file. This usually happens when the user presses &quot;Stop&quot; before the
    upload is finished. In this case, CGI.pm will return undef for the name of
    the uploaded file and set <i></i><i>cgi_error()</i><i></i> to the string
    &quot;400 Bad request (malformed multipart POST)&quot;. This error message
    is designed so that you can incorporate it into a status code to be sent to
    the browser. Example:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
   $file = $q-&gt;upload('uploaded_file');
   if (!$file &amp;&amp; $q-&gt;cgi_error) {
      print $q-&gt;header(-status=&gt;$q-&gt;cgi_error);
      exit 0;
   }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">You are free to create a custom HTML page to complain about the
    error, if you wish.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Progress bars for file uploads and avoiding temp files</i></p>
<p class="Pp">CGI.pm gives you low-level access to file upload management
    through a file upload hook. You can use this feature to completely turn off
    the temp file storage of file uploads, or potentially write your own file
    upload progress meter.</p>
<p class="Pp">This is much like the UPLOAD_HOOK facility available in
    Apache::Request, with the exception that the first argument to the callback
    is an Apache::Upload object, here it's the remote filename.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
 $q = CGI-&gt;new(\&amp;hook [,$data [,$use_tempfile]]);

 sub hook {
        my ($filename, $buffer, $bytes_read, $data) = @_;
        print  &quot;Read $bytes_read bytes of $filename\n&quot;;
 }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">$data</span> field is optional; it lets you
    pass configuration information (e.g. a database handle) to your hook
    callback.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">$use_tempfile</span> field is a flag that
    lets you turn on and off CGI.pm's use of a temporary disk-based file during
    file upload. If you set this to a FALSE value (default true) then
    <span class="Li">$q</span>-&gt;param('uploaded_file') will no longer work,
    and the only way to get at the uploaded data is via the hook you
  provide.</p>
<p class="Pp">If using the function-oriented interface, call the
    <i>CGI::upload_hook()</i> method before calling <i>param()</i> or any other
    CGI functions:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  CGI::upload_hook(\&amp;hook [,$data [,$use_tempfile]]);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This method is not exported by default. You will have to import it
    explicitly if you wish to use it without the CGI:: prefix.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Troubleshooting file uploads on Windows</i></p>
<p class="Pp">If you are using CGI.pm on a Windows platform and find that binary
    files get slightly larger when uploaded but that text files remain the same,
    then you have forgotten to activate binary mode on the output filehandle. Be
    sure to call <i>binmode()</i> on any handle that you create to write the
    uploaded file to disk.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Older ways to process file uploads</i></p>
<p class="Pp">( This section is here for completeness. if you are building a new
    application with CGI.pm, you can skip it. )</p>
<p class="Pp">The original way to process file uploads with CGI.pm was to use
    <i>param()</i>. The value it returns has a dual nature as both a file name
    and a lightweight filehandle. This dual nature is problematic if you
    following the recommended practice of having <span class="Li">&quot;use
    strict&quot;</span> in your code. Perl will complain when you try to use a
    string as a filehandle. More seriously, it is possible for the remote user
    to type garbage into the upload field, in which case what you get from
    <i>param()</i> is not a filehandle at all, but a string.</p>
<p class="Pp">To solve this problem the <i>upload()</i> method was added, which
    always returns a lightweight filehandle. This generally works well, but will
    have trouble interoperating with some other modules because the file handle
    is not derived from IO::Handle. So that brings us to current recommendation
    given above, which is to call the <i>handle()</i> method on the file handle
    returned by <i>upload()</i>. That upgrades the handle to an IO::Handle. It's
    a big win for compatibility for a small penalty of loading IO::Handle the
    first time you call it.</p>

    one. If given a reference to an array of radio button values, then the
    indexes will be jiggered so that the order specified in the array will
    correspond to the tab order. You can also pass a reference to a hash in

    indexes of each button. Examples:</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="HTTP_COOKIES"><a class="permalink" href="#HTTP_COOKIES">HTTP
  COOKIES</a></h1>
Browsers support a so-called &quot;cookie&quot; designed to help maintain state
  within a browser session. CGI.pm has several methods that support cookies.
<p class="Pp">A cookie is a name=value pair much like the named parameters in a
    CGI query string. CGI scripts create one or more cookies and send them to
    the browser in the HTTP header. The browser maintains a list of cookies that
    belong to a particular Web server, and returns them to the CGI script during
    subsequent interactions.</p>
<p class="Pp">In addition to the required name=value pair, each cookie has
    several optional attributes:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>1. an expiration time</dt>
  <dd>This is a time/date string (in a special GMT format) that indicates when a
      cookie expires. The cookie will be saved and returned to your script until
      this expiration date is reached if the user exits the browser and restarts
      it. If an expiration date isn't specified, the cookie will remain active
      until the user quits the browser.</dd>
  <dt>2. a domain</dt>
  <dd>This is a partial or complete domain name for which the cookie is valid.
      The browser will return the cookie to any host that matches the partial
      domain name. For example, if you specify a domain name of
      &quot;.capricorn.com&quot;, then the browser will return the cookie to Web
      servers running on any of the machines &quot;www.capricorn.com&quot;,
      &quot;www2.capricorn.com&quot;, &quot;feckless.capricorn.com&quot;, etc.
      Domain names must contain at least two periods to prevent attempts to
      match on top level domains like &quot;.edu&quot;. If no domain is
      specified, then the browser will only return the cookie to servers on the
      host the cookie originated from.</dd>
  <dt>3. a path</dt>
  <dd>If you provide a cookie path attribute, the browser will check it against
      your script's URL before returning the cookie. For example, if you specify
      the path &quot;/cgi-bin&quot;, then the cookie will be returned to each of
      the scripts &quot;/cgi-bin/tally.pl&quot;, &quot;/cgi-bin/order.pl&quot;,
      and &quot;/cgi-bin/customer_service/complain.pl&quot;, but not to the
      script &quot;/cgi-private/site_admin.pl&quot;. By default, path is set to
      &quot;/&quot;, which causes the cookie to be sent to any CGI script on
      your site.</dd>
  <dt>4. a &quot;secure&quot; flag</dt>
  <dd>If the &quot;secure&quot; attribute is set, the cookie will only be sent
      to your script if the CGI request is occurring on a secure channel, such
      as SSL.</dd>

  <dd>The value of the cookie. This can be any scalar value, array reference, or

<p class="Pp">The cookie and CGI namespaces are separate. If you have a
    parameter named 'answers' and a cookie named 'answers', the values retrieved
    by <i>param()</i> and <i>cookie()</i> are independent of each other.
    However, it's simple to turn a CGI parameter into a cookie, and
  vice-versa:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
   # turn a CGI parameter into a cookie
   $c=cookie(-name=&gt;'answers',-value=&gt;[param('answers')]);
   # vice-versa

It's possible for CGI.pm scripts to write into several browser panels and
  windows using the HTML 4 frame mechanism. There are three techniques for
  defining new frames programmatically:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>1. Create a &lt;Frameset&gt; document</dt>
  <dd>After writing out the HTTP header, instead of creating a standard HTML
      document using the <i>start_html()</i> call, create a &lt;frameset&gt;
      document that defines the frames on the page. Specify your script(s) (with
      appropriate parameters) as the SRC for each of the frames.
    <p class="Pp">There is no specific support for creating &lt;frameset&gt;
        sections in CGI.pm, but the HTML is very simple to write.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>2. Specify the destination for the document in the HTTP header</dt>
  <dd>You may provide a <b>-target</b> parameter to the <i>header()</i> method:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    print header(-target=&gt;'ResultsWindow');
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This will tell the browser to load the output of your script
        into the frame named &quot;ResultsWindow&quot;. If a frame of that name
        doesn't already exist, the browser will pop up a new window and load
        your script's document into that. There are a number of magic names that
        you can use for targets. See the HTML
        <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;frame&gt;&quot;</span> documentation for
        details.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>3. Specify the destination for the document in the &lt;form&gt; tag</dt>
  <dd>You can specify the frame to load in the FORM tag itself. With CGI.pm it
      looks like this:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    print start_form(-target=&gt;'ResultsWindow');
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">When your script is reinvoked by the form, its output will be
        loaded into the frame named &quot;ResultsWindow&quot;. If one doesn't
        already exist a new window will be created.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The script &quot;frameset.cgi&quot; in the examples directory
    shows one way to create pages in which the fill-out form and the response
    live in side-by-side frames.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="SUPPORT_FOR_JAVASCRIPT"><a class="permalink" href="#SUPPORT_FOR_JAVASCRIPT">SUPPORT
  FOR JAVASCRIPT</a></h1>
The usual way to use JavaScript is to define a set of functions in a
  &lt;SCRIPT&gt; block inside the HTML header and then to register event
  handlers in the various elements of the page. Events include such things as
  the mouse passing over a form element, a button being clicked, the contents of
  a text field changing, or a form being submitted. When an event occurs that
  involves an element that has registered an event handler, its associated
  JavaScript code gets called.
<p class="Pp">The elements that can register event handlers include the
    &lt;BODY&gt; of an HTML document, hypertext links, all the various elements
    of a fill-out form, and the form itself. There are a large number of events,
    and each applies only to the elements for which it is relevant. Here is a
    partial list:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>onLoad</b></dt>
  <dd>The browser is loading the current document. Valid in:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
     + The HTML &lt;BODY&gt; section only.
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>onUnload</b></dt>
  <dd>The browser is closing the current page or frame. Valid for:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
     + The HTML &lt;BODY&gt; section only.
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>onSubmit</b></dt>
  <dd>The user has pressed the submit button of a form. This event happens just
      before the form is submitted, and your function can return a value of
      false in order to abort the submission. Valid for:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
     + Forms only.
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>onClick</b></dt>
  <dd>The mouse has clicked on an item in a fill-out form. Valid for:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
     + Buttons (including submit, reset, and image buttons)
     + Checkboxes
     + Radio buttons

  <dd>The user has changed the contents of a field. Valid for:

  <dt><b>onBlur</b></dt>
  <dd>The user has deselected a field (gone to work somewhere else). Valid for:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
     + Text fields
     + Text areas
     + Password fields
     + File fields
     + Popup Menus
     + Scrolling lists
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>onSelect</b></dt>
  <dd>The user has changed the part of a text field that is selected. Valid for:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
     + Text fields
     + Text areas
     + Password fields
     + File fields

     + File fields
     + Popup Menus
     + Scrolling lists
    </pre>
  </dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">In order to register a JavaScript event handler with an HTML
    element, just use the event name as a parameter when you call the
    corresponding CGI method. For example, to have your <i>validateAge()</i>
    JavaScript code executed every time the textfield named &quot;age&quot;
    changes, generate the field like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
 print textfield(-name=&gt;'age',-onChange=&gt;&quot;validateAge(this)&quot;);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This example assumes that you've already declared the
    <i>validateAge()</i> function by incorporating it into a &lt;SCRIPT&gt;
    block. The CGI.pm <i>start_html()</i> method provides a convenient way to
    create this section.</p>
<p class="Pp">Similarly, you can create a form that checks itself over for
    consistency and alerts the user if some essential value is missing by
    creating it this way:
   print start_form(-onSubmit=&gt;&quot;validateMe(this)&quot;);</p>
<p class="Pp">See the javascript.cgi script for a demonstration of how this all
    works.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="LIMITED_SUPPORT_FOR_CASCADING_STYLE_SHEETS"><a class="permalink" href="#LIMITED_SUPPORT_FOR_CASCADING_STYLE_SHEETS">LIMITED
  SUPPORT FOR CASCADING STYLE SHEETS</a></h1>
CGI.pm has limited support for HTML3's cascading style sheets (css). To
  incorporate a stylesheet into your document, pass the <i>start_html()</i>
  method a <b>-style</b> parameter. The value of this parameter may be a scalar,
  in which case it is treated as the source URL for the stylesheet, or it may be
  a hash reference. In the latter case you should provide the hash with one or
  more of <b>-src</b> or <b>-code</b>. <b>-src</b> points to a URL where an
  externally-defined stylesheet can be found. <b>-code</b> points to a scalar
  value to be incorporated into a &lt;style&gt; section. Style definitions in
  <b>-code</b> override similarly-named ones in <b>-src</b>, hence the name
  &quot;cascading.&quot;
<p class="Pp">You may also specify the type of the stylesheet by adding the
    optional <b>-type</b> parameter to the hash pointed to by <b>-style</b>. If
    not specified, the style defaults to 'text/css'.</p>
<p class="Pp">To refer to a style within the body of your document, add the
    <b>-class</b> parameter to any HTML element:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    print h1({-class=&gt;'Fancy'},'Welcome to the Party');
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Or define styles on the fly with the <b>-style</b> parameter:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    print h1({-style=&gt;'Color: red;'},'Welcome to Hell');
</pre>
<p class="Pp">You may also use the new <b></b><b><i>span()</i></b><b></b>
    element to apply a style to a section of text:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    print span({-style=&gt;'Color: red;'},
               h1('Welcome to Hell'),
               &quot;Where did that handbasket get to?&quot;
               );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Note that you must import the &quot;:html3&quot; definitions to
    have the <b></b><b><i>span()</i></b><b></b> method available. Here's a quick
    and dirty example of using CSS's. See the CSS specification at
    http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/ for more information.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    use CGI qw/:standard :html3/;

    #here's a stylesheet incorporated directly into the page
    $newStyle=&lt;&lt;END;

    print h1('CGI with Style'),
          p({-class=&gt;'Tip'},

               &quot;Look Mom, no hands!&quot;,
               p(),
               &quot;Whooo wee!&quot;
               );
    print end_html;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Pass an array reference to <b>-code</b> or <b>-src</b> in order to
    incorporate multiple stylesheets into your document.</p>
<p class="Pp">Should you wish to incorporate a verbatim stylesheet that includes
    arbitrary formatting in the header, you may pass a -verbatim tag to the
    -style hash, as follows:</p>
<p class="Pp">print start_html (-style =&gt; {-verbatim =&gt; '@import
    url(&quot;/server-common/css/'.$cssFile.'&quot;);',
   -src =&gt; '/server-common/css/core.css'});</p>
<p class="Pp">This will generate an HTML header that contains this:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
 &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot;  href=&quot;/server-common/css/core.css&quot;&gt;
   &lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;
   @import url(&quot;/server-common/css/main.css&quot;);
   &lt;/style&gt;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Any additional arguments passed in the -style value will be
    incorporated into the &lt;link&gt; tag. For example:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
 start_html(-style=&gt;{-src=&gt;['/styles/print.css','/styles/layout.css'],
                          -media =&gt; 'all'});
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This will give:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
 &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;/styles/print.css&quot; media=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;/styles/layout.css&quot; media=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="Pp">To make more complicated &lt;link&gt; tags, use the <i>Link()</i>
    function and pass it to <i>start_html()</i> in the -head argument, as
  in:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  @h = (Link({-rel=&gt;'stylesheet',-type=&gt;'text/css',-src=&gt;'/ss/ss.css',-media=&gt;'all'}),
        Link({-rel=&gt;'stylesheet',-type=&gt;'text/css',-src=&gt;'/ss/fred.css',-media=&gt;'paper'}));
  print start_html({-head=&gt;\@h})
</pre>
<p class="Pp">To create primary and &quot;alternate&quot; stylesheet, use the
    <b>-alternate</b> option:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
 start_html(-style=&gt;{-src=&gt;[

If you are running the script from the command line or in the perl debugger, you
  can pass the script a list of keywords or parameter=value pairs on the command
  line or from standard input (you don't have to worry about tricking your

  this:
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>

Some of the more useful environment variables can be fetched through this
  interface. The methods are as follows:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b></b><b><i>Accept()</i></b><b></b></dt>
  <dd>Return a list of MIME types that the remote browser accepts. If you give
      this method a single argument corresponding to a MIME type, as in
      Accept('text/html'), it will return a floating point value corresponding
      to the browser's preference for this type from 0.0 (don't want) to 1.0.
      Glob types (e.g. text/*) in the browser's accept list are handled

      function.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b></b><b><i>raw_cookie()</i></b><b></b></dt>
  <dd>Returns the HTTP_COOKIE variable. Cookies have a special format, and this
      method call just returns the raw form (?cookie dough). See <i>cookie()</i>
      for ways of setting and retrieving cooked cookies.
    <p class="Pp">Called with no parameters, <i>raw_cookie()</i> returns the

        splitting on the character sequence &quot;; &quot;. Called with the name
        of a cookie, retrieves the <b>unescaped</b> form of the cookie. You can
        use the regular <i>cookie()</i> method to get the names, or use the
        <i>raw_fetch()</i> method from the CGI::Cookie module.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="USING_NPH_SCRIPTS"><a class="permalink" href="#USING_NPH_SCRIPTS">USING
  NPH SCRIPTS</a></h1>
NPH, or &quot;no-parsed-header&quot;, scripts bypass the server completely by
  sending the complete HTTP header directly to the browser. This has slight
  performance benefits, but is of most use for taking advantage of HTTP
  extensions that are not directly supported by your server, such as server push
  and PICS headers.
<p class="Pp">Servers use a variety of conventions for designating CGI scripts
    as NPH. Many Unix servers look at the beginning of the script's name for the
    prefix &quot;nph-&quot;. The Macintosh WebSTAR server and Microsoft's
    Internet Information Server, in contrast, try to decide whether a program is
    an NPH script by examining the first line of script output.</p>
<p class="Pp">CGI.pm supports NPH scripts with a special NPH mode. When in this
    mode, CGI.pm will output the necessary extra header information when the
    <i>header()</i> and <i>redirect()</i> methods are called.</p>
<p class="Pp">The Microsoft Internet Information Server requires NPH mode. As of
    version 2.30, CGI.pm will automatically detect when the script is running
    under IIS and put itself into this mode. You do not need to do this
    manually, although it won't hurt anything if you do. However, note that if
    you have applied Service Pack 6, much of the functionality of NPH scripts,
    including the ability to redirect while setting a cookie, <b>do not work at
    all</b> on IIS without a special patch from Microsoft. See

<h1 class="Sh" id="Server_Push"><a class="permalink" href="#Server_Push">Server
  Push</a></h1>
CGI.pm provides four simple functions for producing multipart documents of the
  type needed to implement server push. These functions were graciously provided
  by Ed Jordan &lt;ed@fidalgo.net&gt;. To import these into your namespace, you
  must import the &quot;:push&quot; set. You are also advised to put the script
  into NPH mode and to set $| to 1 to avoid buffering problems.
<p class="Pp">Here is a simple script that demonstrates server push:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  #!/usr/local/bin/perl
  use CGI qw/:push -nph/;
  $| = 1;
  print multipart_init(-boundary=&gt;'----here we go!');
  for (0 .. 4) {
      print multipart_start(-type=&gt;'text/plain'),
            &quot;The current time is &quot;,scalar(localtime),&quot;\n&quot;;
      if ($_ &lt; 4) {
              print multipart_end;
      } else {
              print multipart_final;
      }
      sleep 1;
  }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This script initializes server push by calling
    <b></b><b><i>multipart_init()</i></b><b></b>. It then enters a loop in which
    it begins a new multipart section by calling
    <b></b><b><i>multipart_start()</i></b> <b></b>, prints the current local
    time, and ends a multipart section with
    <b></b><b><i>multipart_end()</i></b><b></b>. It then sleeps a second, and
    begins again. On the final iteration, it ends the multipart section with
    <b></b> <b><i>multipart_final()</i></b><b></b> rather than with
    <b></b><b><i>multipart_end()</i></b><b></b>.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><i>multipart_init()</i></dt>

    <pre>
  multipart_init(-boundary=&gt;$boundary);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Initialize the multipart system. The -boundary argument
        specifies what MIME boundary string to use to separate parts of the

  </dd>
  <dt><i>multipart_start()</i></dt>

        called instead of <i>multipart_end()</i>.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="Avoiding_Denial_of_Service_Attacks"><a class="permalink" href="#Avoiding_Denial_of_Service_Attacks">Avoiding
  Denial of Service Attacks</a></h1>
A potential problem with CGI.pm is that, by default, it attempts to process form
  POSTings no matter how large they are. A wily hacker could attack your site by
  sending a CGI script a huge POST of many megabytes. CGI.pm will attempt to
  read the entire POST into a variable, growing hugely in size until it runs out
  of memory. While the script attempts to allocate the memory the system may
  slow down dramatically. This is a form of denial of service attack.
<p class="Pp">Another possible attack is for the remote user to force CGI.pm to
    accept a huge file upload. CGI.pm will accept the upload and store it in a
    temporary directory even if your script doesn't expect to receive an
    uploaded file. CGI.pm will delete the file automatically when it terminates,
    but in the meantime the remote user may have filled up the server's disk
    space, causing problems for other programs.</p>
<p class="Pp">The best way to avoid denial of service attacks is to limit the
    amount of memory, CPU time and disk space that CGI scripts can use. Some Web
    servers come with built-in facilities to accomplish this. In other cases,
    you can use the shell <i>limit</i> or <i>ulimit</i> commands to put ceilings
    on CGI resource usage.</p>
<p class="Pp">CGI.pm also has some simple built-in protections against denial of
    service attacks, but you must activate them before you can use them. These
    take the form of two global variables in the CGI name space:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b></b><b>$CGI::POST_MAX</b><b></b></dt>
  <dd>If set to a non-negative integer, this variable puts a ceiling on the size
      of POSTings, in bytes. If CGI.pm detects a POST that is greater than the
      ceiling, it will immediately exit with an error message. This value will
      affect both ordinary POSTs and multipart POSTs, meaning that it limits the
      maximum size of file uploads as well. You should set this to a reasonably
      high value, such as 1 megabyte.</dd>
  <dt><b></b><b>$CGI::DISABLE_UPLOADS</b><b></b></dt>
  <dd>If set to a non-zero value, this will disable file uploads completely.
      Other fill-out form values will work as usual.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">You can use these variables in either of two ways.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>1. On a script-by-script basis</b></dt>
  <dd>Set the variable at the top of the script, right after the &quot;use&quot;
      statement:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    use CGI qw/:standard/;
    use CGI::Carp 'fatalsToBrowser';
    $CGI::POST_MAX=1024 * 100;  # max 100K posts
    $CGI::DISABLE_UPLOADS = 1;  # no uploads
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>2. Globally for all scripts</b></dt>
  <dd>Open up CGI.pm, find the definitions for <span class="Li">$POST_MAX</span>
      and <span class="Li">$DISABLE_UPLOADS</span>, and set them to the desired
      values. You'll find them towards the top of the file in a subroutine named
      <i>initialize_globals()</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">An attempt to send a POST larger than
    <span class="Li">$POST_MAX</span> bytes will cause
    <i></i><i>param()</i><i></i> to return an empty CGI parameter list. You can
    test for this event by checking <i></i><i>cgi_error()</i><i></i>, either
    after you create the CGI object or, if you are using the function-oriented
    interface, call &lt;<i>param()</i>&gt; for the first time. If the POST was
    intercepted, then <i>cgi_error()</i> will return the message &quot;413 POST
    too large&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">This error message is actually defined by the HTTP protocol, and
    is designed to be returned to the browser as the CGI script's status
   code. For example:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
   $uploaded_file = param('upload');
   if (!$uploaded_file &amp;&amp; cgi_error()) {
      print header(-status=&gt;cgi_error());
      exit 0;
   }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">However it isn't clear that any browser currently knows what to do
    with this status code. It might be better just to create an HTML page that
    warns the user of the problem.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="COMPATIBILITY_WITH_CGI_-LIB.PL"><a class="permalink" href="#COMPATIBILITY_WITH_CGI_-LIB.PL">COMPATIBILITY
  WITH CGI-LIB.PL</a></h1>
To make it easier to port existing programs that use cgi-lib.pl the
  compatibility routine &quot;ReadParse&quot; is provided. Porting is simple:
<p class="Pp">OLD VERSION</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    require &quot;cgi-lib.pl&quot;;
    &amp;ReadParse;
    print &quot;The value of the antique is $in{antique}.\n&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">NEW VERSION</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    use CGI;
    CGI::ReadParse();
    print &quot;The value of the antique is $in{antique}.\n&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">CGI.pm's <i>ReadParse()</i> routine creates a tied variable named
    <span class="Li">%in</span>, which can be accessed to obtain the query
    variables. Like ReadParse, you can also provide your own variable.
    Infrequently used features of ReadParse, such as the creation of
    <span class="Li">@in</span> and <span class="Li">$in</span> variables, are
    not supported.</p>
<p class="Pp">Once you use ReadParse, you can retrieve the query object itself
    this way:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    $q = $in{CGI};
    print $q-&gt;textfield(-name=&gt;'wow',
            -value=&gt;'does this really work?');
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This allows you to start using the more interesting features of
    CGI.pm without rewriting your old scripts from scratch.</p>
<p class="Pp">An even simpler way to mix cgi-lib calls with CGI.pm calls is to
    import both the <span class="Li">&quot;:cgi-lib&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;:standard&quot;</span> method:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
 use CGI qw(:cgi-lib :standard);
 &amp;ReadParse;
 print &quot;The price of your purchase is $in{price}.\n&quot;;
 print textfield(-name=&gt;'price', -default=&gt;'$1.99');
