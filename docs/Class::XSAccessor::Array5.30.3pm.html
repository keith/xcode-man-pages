  use Class::XSAccessor {

<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The module implements fast XS accessors both for getting at and
    setting an object attribute. Additionally, the module supports mutators and
    simple predicates (<span class="Li">&quot;has_foo()&quot;</span> like tests
    for definedness of an attributes). The module works only with objects that
    are implemented as <b>arrays</b>. Using it on hash-based objects is bound to
    make your life miserable. Refer to Class::XSAccessor for an implementation
    that works with hash-based objects.</p>
<p class="Pp">A simple benchmark showed a significant performance advantage over
    writing accessors in Perl.</p>
<p class="Pp">Since version 0.10, the module can also generate simple
    constructors (implemented in XS) for you. Simply supply the
    <span class="Li">&quot;constructor =&gt; 'constructor_name'&quot;</span>
    option or the <span class="Li">&quot;constructors =&gt; ['new', 'create',
    'spawn']&quot;</span> option. These constructors do the equivalent of the
    following Perl code:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  sub new {
    my $class = shift;
    return bless [], ref($class)||$class;
  }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">That means they can be called on objects and classes but will not
    clone objects entirely. Note that any parameters to <b>new()</b> will be
    discarded! If there is a better idiom for array-based objects, let me
  know.</p>
<p class="Pp">While generally more obscure than hash-based objects, objects
    using blessed arrays as internal representation are a bit faster as its
    somewhat faster to access arrays than hashes. Accordingly, this module is
    slightly faster (~10-15%) than Class::XSAccessor, which works on hash-based
    objects.</p>
<p class="Pp">The method names may be fully qualified. In the example of the
    synopsis, you could have written
    <span class="Li">&quot;MyClass::get_foo&quot;</span> instead of
    <span class="Li">&quot;get_foo&quot;</span>. This way, you can install
    methods in classes other than the current class. See also: The
    <span class="Li">&quot;class&quot;</span> option below.</p>
<p class="Pp">Since version 1.01, you can generate extremely simple methods
    which just return true or false (and always do so). If that seems like a
    really superfluous thing to you, then think of a large class hierarchy with
    interfaces such as PPI. This is implemented as the
    <span class="Li">&quot;true&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;false&quot;</span> options, see synopsis.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">In addition to specifying the types and names of accessors, you
    can add options which modify behaviour. The options are specified as
    key/value pairs just as the accessor declaration. Example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  use Class::XSAccessor::Array
    getters =&gt; {
      get_foo =&gt; 0,
    },
    replace =&gt; 1;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The list of available options is:</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="replace"><a class="permalink" href="#replace">replace</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Set this to a true value to prevent
    <span class="Li">&quot;Class::XSAccessor::Array&quot;</span> from
    complaining about replacing existing subroutines.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="chained"><a class="permalink" href="#chained">chained</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Set this to a true value to change the return value of setters and
    mutators (when called with an argument). If
    <span class="Li">&quot;chained&quot;</span> is enabled, the setters and
    accessors/mutators will return the object. Mutators called without an
    argument still return the value of the associated attribute.</p>
<p class="Pp">As with the other options,
    <span class="Li">&quot;chained&quot;</span> affects all methods generated in
    the same <span class="Li">&quot;use Class::XSAccessor::Array
    ...&quot;</span> statement.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="class"><a class="permalink" href="#class">class</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">By default, the accessors are generated in the calling class.
    Using the <span class="Li">&quot;class&quot;</span> option, you can
    explicitly specify where the methods are to be generated.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="LVALUES"><a class="permalink" href="#LVALUES">LVALUES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Support for lvalue accessors via the keyword
    <span class="Li">&quot;lvalue_accessors&quot;</span> was added in version
    1.08. At this point, <b>THEY ARE CONSIDERED HIGHLY</b> <b>EXPERIMENTAL</b>.
    Furthermore, their performance hasn't been benchmarked yet.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following example demonstrates an lvalue accessor:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  package Address;
  use Class::XSAccessor
    constructor =&gt; 'new',
    lvalue_accessors =&gt; { zip_code =&gt; 0 };
  
  package main;
  my $address = Address-&gt;new(2);
  print $address-&gt;zip_code, &quot;\n&quot;; # prints 2
  $address-&gt;zip_code = 76135; # &lt;--- This is it!
  print $address-&gt;zip_code, &quot;\n&quot;; # prints 76135
</pre>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="CAVEATS"><a class="permalink" href="#CAVEATS">CAVEATS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Probably wouldn't work if your objects are <i>tied</i>. But that's
    a strange thing to do anyway.</p>
<p class="Pp">Scary code exploiting strange XS features.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you think writing an accessor in XS should be a laughably
    simple exercise, then please contemplate how you could instantiate a new XS
    accessor for a new hash key or array index that's only known at run-time.
    Note that compiling C code at run-time a la Inline::C is a no go.</p>
<p class="Pp">Threading. With version 1.00, a memory leak has been <b>fixed</b>
    that would leak a small amount of memory if you loaded
    <span class="Li">&quot;Class::XSAccessor&quot;</span>-based classes in a
    subthread that hadn't been loaded in the &quot;main&quot; thread before. If
    the subthread then terminated, a hash key and an int per associated method
    used to be lost. Note that this mattered only if classes were <b>only</b>
    loaded in a sort of throw-away thread.</p>
<p class="Pp">In the new implementation as of 1.00, the memory will not be
    released again either in the above situation. But it will be recycled when
    the same class or a similar class is loaded again in <b>any</b> thread.</p>
