   Set up some character translations and predefined strings.  \*(-- will
   give an unbreakable dash, \*(PI will give pi, \*(L" will give a left
   double quote, and \*(R" will give a right double quote.  \*(C+ will
   give a nicer C++.  Capital omega is used to do unbreakable dashes and
   therefore won't be available.  \*(C` and \*(C' expand to `' in nroff,
   nothing in troff, for use with C<>.

The Config module contains all the information that was available to the
  <span class="Li">&quot;Configure&quot;</span> program at Perl build time (over
  900 values).
<p class="Pp">Shell variables from the <i>config.sh</i> file (written by
    Configure) are stored in the readonly-variable
    <span class="Li">%Config</span>, indexed by their names.</p>
<p class="Pp">Values stored in config.sh as 'undef' are returned as undefined
    values. The perl <span class="Li">&quot;exists&quot;</span> function can be
    used to check if a named variable exists.</p>
<p class="Pp">For a description of the variables, please have a look at the
    Glossary file, as written in the Porting folder, or use the url:
    https://github.com/Perl/perl5/blob/blead/Porting/Glossary</p>

Because this information is not stored within the perl executable itself it is
  possible (but unlikely) that the information does not relate to the actual
  perl binary which is being used to access it.
<p class="Pp">The Config module is installed into the architecture and version
    specific library directory ($Config{installarchlib}) and it checks the perl
    version number when loaded.</p>
<p class="Pp">The values stored in config.sh may be either single-quoted or
    double-quoted. Double-quoted strings are handy for those cases where you
    need to include escape sequences in the strings. To avoid runtime variable
    interpolation, any <span class="Li">&quot;$&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;@&quot;</span> characters are replaced by
    <span class="Li">&quot;\$&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;\@&quot;</span>, respectively. This isn't foolproof,
    of course, so don't embed <span class="Li">&quot;\$&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;\@&quot;</span> in double-quoted strings unless
    you're willing to deal with the consequences. (The slashes will end up
    escaped and the <span class="Li">&quot;$&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;@&quot;</span> will trigger variable
  interpolation)</p>

Most <span class="Li">&quot;Config&quot;</span> variables are determined by the
  <span class="Li">&quot;Configure&quot;</span> script on platforms supported by
  it (which is most UNIX platforms). Some platforms have custom-made
  <span class="Li">&quot;Config&quot;</span> variables, and may thus not have
  some of the variables described below, or may have extraneous variables
  specific to that particular port. See the port specific documentation in such
  cases.

  <dd>From <i>installstyle.U</i>:
    <p class="Pp">This variable describes the
        <span class="Li">&quot;style&quot;</span> of the perl installation. This
        is intended to be useful for tools that need to manipulate entire perl
        distributions. Perl itself doesn't use this to find its libraries -- the
        library directories are stored directly in <i>Config.pm</i>. Currently,
        there are only two styles: <span class="Li">&quot;lib&quot;</span> and
        <i>lib/perl5</i>. The default library locations (e.g. privlib, sitelib)
        are either <i></i><i>$prefix</i><i>/lib</i> or
        <i></i><i>$prefix</i><i>/lib/perl5</i>. The former is useful if
        <span class="Li">$prefix</span> is a directory dedicated to perl (e.g.
        <i>/opt/perl</i>), while the latter is useful if
        <span class="Li">$prefix</span> is shared by many packages, e.g. if
        <span class="Li">$prefix</span>=<i>/usr/local</i>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Unfortunately, while this
        <span class="Li">&quot;style&quot;</span> variable is used to set
        defaults for all three directory hierarchies (core, vendor, and site),
        there is no guarantee that the same style is actually appropriate for
        all those directories. For example, <span class="Li">$prefix</span>
        might be <i>/opt/perl</i>, but <span class="Li">$siteprefix</span> might
        be <i>/usr/local</i>. (Perhaps, in retrospect, the
        <span class="Li">&quot;lib&quot;</span> style should never have been
        supported, but it did seem like a nice idea at the time.)</p>
    <p class="Pp">The situation is even less clear for tools such as MakeMaker
        that can be used to install additional modules into non-standard places.
        For example, if a user intends to install a module into a private
        directory (perhaps by setting <span class="Li">&quot;PREFIX&quot;</span>
        on the <i>Makefile.PL</i> command line), then there is no reason to
        assume that the Configure-time <span class="Li">$installstyle</span>
        setting will be relevant for that
        <span class="Li">&quot;PREFIX&quot;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This may later be extended to include other information, so be
        careful with pattern-matching on the results.</p>
    <p class="Pp">For compatibility with <i>perl5.005</i> and earlier, the
        default setting is based on whether or not
        <span class="Li">$prefix</span> contains the string

        to setting installperl's -v option. In particular, the non-versioned
