perl-ldap is the distribution name. The perl-ldap distribution contains the
  Net::LDAP modules.

  another Perl LDAP implementation?</a></h2>
perl-ldap's goal is to be as portable as possible. It does this by being
  implemented completely in Perl. So basically anywhere that Perl runs perl-ldap
  will run. This is not true for other implementations which require a C
  compiler.

<h1 class="Sh" id="LDAP_AND_DIRECTORY_TERMINOLOGY."><a class="permalink" href="#LDAP_AND_DIRECTORY_TERMINOLOGY.">LDAP
  AND DIRECTORY TERMINOLOGY.</a></h1>
In order to help the user understand the perl-ldap module better some key LDAP
  terminology is defined here.
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="What_is_a_directory?"><a class="permalink" href="#What_is_a_directory?">What
  is a directory?</a></h2>
A directory is a special purpose hierarchical database that usually contains
  typed information such as text strings, binary data, or X.509 certificates.
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="What_is__s-1LDAP_s0?"><a class="permalink" href="#What_is__s-1LDAP_s0?">What
  is LDAP?</a></h2>
LDAP stands for Lightweight Directory Access Protocol. The word <i>Protocol</i>
  is the key word in the definition given in the preceding sentence, LDAP is
  <i>NOT</i> hardware or software. It is a protocol that defines how a client
  and server will communicate with one another.
<p class="Pp">The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol is defined in a series
    of Requests For Comments, better known as RFCs. The RFCs can be found on the
    Internet at http://www.ietf.org/ (the master repository) and many other
    places. There's a link to all the LDAP-related RFCs at perl-ldap's web site,
    http://ldap.perl.org/rfc.html. Some of the more important RFC numbers are
    RFC 4510 - 4519 for LDAP (previously called LDAPv3) and the historic RFC
    1777 for LDAPv2.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="What_is_a__s-1LDAP_s0_Directory?"><a class="permalink" href="#What_is_a__s-1LDAP_s0_Directory?">What
  is a LDAP Directory?</a></h2>
In the strictest terms of the definition there is no such thing as a LDAP
  directory. To be practical about this situation every day directory
  professionals refer to their directory as &quot; a LDAP directory&quot;
  because it is easy to say and it does convey the type of protocol used to
  communicate with their directory. Using this definition a LDAP directory is a
  directory whose server software conforms to the Lightweight Directory Access
  Protocol when communicating with a client.
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="What_is_an_Entry?"><a class="permalink" href="#What_is_an_Entry?">What
  is an Entry?</a></h2>
The traditional directory definition of a directory object is called an Entry.
  Entries are composed of attributes that contain the information to be recorded
  about the object.
<p class="Pp">(An entry in LDAP is somewhat analogous to a record in a table in
    an SQL database, but don't get too hung up about this analogy!)</p>
<p class="Pp">Entries are held in an upside-down tree structure. Entries can
    therefore contain subordinate entries, and entries <b>must</b> have one
    direct superior entry.</p>
<p class="Pp">Entries with subordinate entries are called 'non-leaf'
  entries.</p>
<p class="Pp">Entries without subordinate entries are called 'leaf' entries.</p>
<p class="Pp">An entry's direct superior entry is called the entry's
  'parent'.</p>
<p class="Pp">'Non-leaf' entries are also said to have 'child' entries.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="What_is_an_attribute?"><a class="permalink" href="#What_is_an_attribute?">What
  is an attribute?</a></h2>
The entry(s) in a directory are composed of attributes that contain information
  about the object. Each attribute has a type and can contain one or more
  values.
<p class="Pp">For example:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  cn=Road Runner
</pre>
<p class="Pp">is an attribute with a type named &quot;cn&quot;, and one
  value.</p>
<p class="Pp">Each attribute is described by a 'syntax' which defines what kind
    of information can be stored in the attributes values. Trying to store a
    value that doesn't conform to the attribute's syntax will result in an
    error.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  jpegPhoto=unknown
</pre>
<p class="Pp">is not permitted by the directory, because jpegPhotos may only
    contain JPEG-formatted images.</p>
<p class="Pp">Most syntaxes used in LDAP however describe text strings rather
    than binary objects (like JPEGs or certificates.)</p>
<p class="Pp">In LDAPv3 most of these syntaxes support Unicode encoded using
    UTF-8. Because the Net::LDAP modules do not change the strings that you pass
    in as attribute values (they get sent to the LDAP server as-is) to use
    accented characters you simply need to encode your strings in UTF-8. There
    are modules on CPAN that will help you here.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that LDAPv2 servers used something called T.61 instead of
    Unicode and UTF-8. Most servers do not implement T.61 correctly, and it is
    recommended that you use LDAPv3 instead.</p>
<p class="Pp">Attributes may also be searched. The algorithms used to perform
    different kinds of searches are described by the attribute's 'matching
    rules'. Some matching rules are case-sensitive and some are
    case-insensitive, for example. Sometimes matching rules aren't defined for a
    particular attribute: there's no way to search for jpegPhotos that contain a
    substring!</p>
<p class="Pp">You can examine all of a server's attribute definitions by reading
    the schema from the server.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="What_is_an_object_class?"><a class="permalink" href="#What_is_an_object_class?">What
  is an object class?</a></h2>
An object class is the name associated with a group of attributes that
  <b>must</b> be present in an entry, and the group of attributes that
  <b>may</b> also be present in an entry.
<p class="Pp">Object classes may be derived (subclassed) from other object
    classes. For example the widely used 'inetOrgPerson' object class is derived
    from 'organizationalPerson', which is itself derived from 'person' which is
    itself derived from 'top'.</p>
<p class="Pp">Every entry has an attribute called 'objectClass' that lists all
    the names of object classes (and their superclasses) being used with the
    entry.</p>

  is a Distinguished Name (DN)?</a></h2>
Every entry in a directory has a Distinguished Name, or DN. It is a unique Entry
  identifier throughout the complete directory. No two Entries can have the same
  DN within the same directory.
<p class="Pp">Examples of DNs:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
 cn=Road Runner, ou=bird, dc=cartoon, dc=com
 ou=bird, dc=cartoon, dc=com
 dc=cartoon, dc=com

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="What_is_a_Relative_Distinguished_Name?"><a class="permalink" href="#What_is_a_Relative_Distinguished_Name?">What
  is a Relative Distinguished Name?</a></h2>
Every DN is made up of a sequence of Relative Distinguished Names, or RDNs. The
  sequences of RDNs are separated by commas (,). In LDAPv2 semi-colons (;) were
  also allowed. There can be more than one identical RDN in a directory, but
  they must have different parent entries.
<p class="Pp">Technically, an RDN contains attribute-value assertions, or AVAs.
    When an AVA is written down, the attribute name is separated from the
    attribute value with an equals (=) sign.</p>
<p class="Pp">Example of a DN:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
 cn=Road Runner,ou=bird,dc=cartoon,dc=com

 RDNs of the proceeding DN:
 RDN =&gt; cn=Road Runner
 RDN =&gt; ou=bird
 RDN =&gt; dc=cartoon
 RDN =&gt; dc=com
</pre>
<p class="Pp">RDNs can contain multiple attributes, though this is somewhat
    unusual. They are called multi-AVA RDNs, and each AVA is separated in the
    RDN from the others with a plus sign (+).</p>
<p class="Pp">Example of a DN with a multi-AVA RDN:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
 cn=Road Runner+l=Arizona,ou=bird,dc=cartoon,dc=com

<h2 class="Ss" id="Where_is_an_entry's_name_held?"><a class="permalink" href="#Where_is_an_entry's_name_held?">Where
  is an entry's name held?</a></h2>
Entries do <b>not</b> contain their DN. When you retrieve an entry from a
  search, the server will tell you the DN of each entry.
<p class="Pp">On the other hand, entries <b>do</b> contain their RDN. Recall
    that the RDN is formed from one or more attribute-value assertions (AVAs);
    each entry must contain all the attributes and values in the RDN.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example the entry:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
 cn=Road Runner+l=Arizona,ou=bird,dc=cartoon,dc=com
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><b>must</b> contain a 'cn' attribute containing at least the value
    &quot;Road Runner&quot;, <b>and</b> an 'l' attribute containing at least the
    value &quot;Arizona&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">The attributes used in the RDN may contain additional values, but
    the entry still only has one DN.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="What_is_a_search_base?"><a class="permalink" href="#What_is_a_search_base?">What
  is a search base?</a></h2>
A search base is a Distinguished Name that is the starting point of search
  queries.
<p class="Pp">Example of a DN:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
 cn=Road Runner,ou=bird,dc=cartoon,dc=com
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Possible search base(s) for the proceeding DN:</p>

 Base =&gt; cn=Road Runner,ou=bird,dc=cartoon,dc=com
 Base =&gt; ou=bird,dc=cartoon,dc=com
 Base =&gt; dc=cartoon,dc=com

<h2 class="Ss" id="What_is_the_difference_between_a__s-1LDAP_s0_server_and_a_relational_database?"><a class="permalink" href="#What_is_the_difference_between_a__s-1LDAP_s0_server_and_a_relational_database?">What
  is the difference between a LDAP server and a relational database?</a></h2>
The most basic difference is that a directory server is a specialized database
  designed to provide fast searches. While a relational database is optimized
  for transactions (where a series of operations is counted as 1, thus if one of
  the steps fails, the RDBMS can roll-back to the state it was in before you
  started).
<p class="Pp">Directories also typically are hierarchical in nature (RDBMS is
    typically flat, but you can implement a hierarchy using tables and queries),
    networkable, distributed and replicated.</p>
<p class="Pp">LDAP provides an open-standard to a directory service.</p>
<p class="Pp">Typically we use LDAP for email directories (all popular email
    clients provide an LDAP client now) and authorization services
    (authentication and access control).</p>
<p class="Pp">You could use a RDBMS for these types of queries but there's no
    set standard, in particular over TCP/IP to connect to databases over the
    network. There's language specific protocols (like Perl's DBI and Java's
    JDBC) that hide this problem behind an API abstraction, but that's not a
    replacement for a standard access protocol.</p>
<p class="Pp">LDAP is starting to be used on roles traditionally played by RDBMS
    in terms of general data management because it's easier to setup a LDAP
    server (once you understand the basic nomenclature) and you don't need a DBA
    to write your queries and more importantly all LDAP servers speak the same
    essential protocol, thus you don't have to fuss with a database driver
    trying to connect it to the Internet. Once you have an LDAP server up and
    running, it's automatically available over the 'net. It's possible to
    connect to a LDAP server from a variety of mechanisms, including just about
    every possible programming language.</p>

The DN used to bind to a directory is a FULLY QUALIFIED DN. The exact structure

Most methods in Net::LDAP return a Net::LDAP::Message object, or a sub-class of

  code.
<p class="Pp">So, for example, to determine the result of the bind
  operation.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>

Your search results are stored in a 'search object'. Consider the following:

<pre>
 use Net::LDAP;

 $ldap = Net::LDAP-&gt;new('ldap.acme.com') or die &quot;$@&quot;;
 $mesg = $ldap-&gt;search(

                      );
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">$mesg</span> is a search object. It is a
    reference blessed into the Net::LDAP::Search package. By calling methods on
    this object you can obtain information about the result and also the
    individual entries.</p>
<p class="Pp">The first thing to check is if the search was successful. This is
    done with the method <span class="Li">$mesg</span>-&gt;code. This method
    will return the status code that the server returned. A success will yield a
    zero value, but there are other values, some of which could also be
    considered a success. See Net::LDAP::Constant</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  use Net::LDAP::Util qw(ldap_error_text);

  die ldap_error_text($mesg-&gt;code)
    if $mesg-&gt;code;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">There are two ways in which you can access the entries. You can
    access then with an index or you can treat the container like a stack and
    shift each entry in turn. For example</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  # as an array

  # How many entries were returned from the search
  my $max = $mesg-&gt;count;

  for (my $index = 0 ; $index &lt; $max ; $index++) {
    my $entry = $mesg-&gt;entry($index);
    # ...
  }

  # or as a stack

  while (my $entry = $mesg-&gt;shift_entry) {
    # ...
  }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">In each case <span class="Li">$entry</span> is an entry object. It
    is a reference blessed into the Net::LDAP::Entry package. By calling methods
    on this object you can obtain information about the entry.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, to obtain the DN for the entry</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  $dn = $entry-&gt;dn;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">To obtain the attributes that a given entry has</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  @attrs = $entry-&gt;attributes;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">And to get the list of values for a given attribute</p>

<p class="Pp">And to get the first of the values for a given attribute</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  $values = $entry-&gt;get( 'cn' );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">One thing to remember is that attribute names are case
    insensitive, so 'sn', 'Sn', 'sN' and 'SN' are all the same.</p>
<p class="Pp">So, if you want to print all the values for the attribute

<h1 class="Sh" id="GETTING_SEARCH_RESULTS"><a class="permalink" href="#GETTING_SEARCH_RESULTS">GETTING
  SEARCH RESULTS</a></h1>
There are two ways of retrieving the results of a requested LDAP search; inline
  and by using a callback subroutine.
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="_s-1USING_THE_INLINE_APPROACH_s0"><a class="permalink" href="#_s-1USING_THE_INLINE_APPROACH_s0">USING
  THE INLINE APPROACH</a></h2>
Using the inline approach involves requesting the data and then waiting for all
  of the data to be returned before the user starts processing the data.
<p class="Pp">Example:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
 use Net::LDAP;

 $ldap = Net::LDAP-&gt;new('ldap.acme.com') or die &quot;$@&quot;;
 $mesg = $ldap-&gt;search(
                       base   =&gt; &quot;o=acme.com&quot;,
                       scope  =&gt; 'sub',
                       filter =&gt; &quot;sn=smith&quot;,
                      );
 #
 # At this point the user can get the returned data as an array
 # or as a stack.
 # In this example we will use an array

 # How many entries were returned from the search
 my $max = $mesg-&gt;count;

 for (my $index = 0 ; $index &lt; $max ; $index++)
 {
   my $entry = $mesg-&gt;entry($index);
   my $dn = $entry-&gt;dn; # Obtain DN of this entry

   @attrs = $entry-&gt;attributes; # Obtain attributes for this entry.
   foreach my $var (@attrs)
   {
     #get a list of values for a given attribute
     $attr = $entry-&gt;get_value( $var, asref =&gt; 1 );
     if ( defined($attr) )
     {
       foreach my $value ( @$attr )
       {
         print &quot;$var: $value\n&quot;;  # Print each value for the attribute.
       }
     }
   }
 }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">As you can see the example is straightforward, but there is one
    drawback to this approach. You must wait until all entries for the request
    search to be returned before you can process the data. If there several
    thousand entries that match the search filter this could take quite a long
    time period.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="_s-1USING_THE_CALLBACK_SUBROUTINE_APPROACH_s0"><a class="permalink" href="#_s-1USING_THE_CALLBACK_SUBROUTINE_APPROACH_s0">USING
  THE CALLBACK SUBROUTINE APPROACH</a></h2>
Using the callback approach involves requesting the data be sent to a callback
  subroutine as each entry arrives at the client.
<p class="Pp">A callback is just a subroutine that is passed two parameters when
    it is called, the mesg and entry objects.</p>
<p class="Pp">Example:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
 use Net::LDAP;

 $ldap = Net::LDAP-&gt;new('ldap.acme.com') or die &quot;$@&quot;;
 $mesg = $ldap-&gt;search(
                       base   =&gt; &quot;o=acme.com&quot;,
                       scope  =&gt; 'sub',
                       filter =&gt; &quot;sn=smith&quot;,
                       callback =&gt; \&amp;callback,
                      );
 #
 # At this point the user needs to check the status of the
 # ldap search.
 #

 if ( $mesg-&gt;code )
 {
    $errstr = $mesg-&gt;code;
    print &quot;Error code:  $errstr\n&quot;;
    $errstr = ldap_error_text($errstr);
    print &quot;$errstr\n&quot;;
 }


 sub callback
 {
 my ( $mesg, $entry) = @_;

   #
   # First you must check to see if something was returned.
   # Last execution of callback subroutine will have no
   # defined entry and mesg object
   #
   if ( !defined($entry) )
   {
     print &quot;No records found matching filter $match.\n&quot;
     if ($mesg-&gt;count == 0) ; # if mesg is not defined nothing will print.
     return;
   }

   my $dn = $entry-&gt;dn; # Obtain DN of this entry

   @attrs = $entry-&gt;attributes; # Obtain attributes for this entry.
   foreach my $var (@attrs)
   {
    #get a list of values for a given attribute
    $attr = $entry-&gt;get_value( $var, asref =&gt; 1 );
    if ( defined($attr) )
    {
      foreach my $value ( @$attr )
      {
        print &quot;$var: $value\n&quot;;  # Print each value for the attribute.
      }
    }
   }
   #
   # For large search requests the following line of code
   # may be very important, it will reduce the amount of memory
   # used by the search results.
   #
   # If the user is not worried about memory usage then the line
   # of code can be omitted.
   #
   $mesg-&gt;pop_entry;

 }  # End of callback subroutine
</pre>
<p class="Pp">As you can see the example is straightforward and it does not
    waste time waiting for all of the entries to be returned. However if the
    pop_entry method is not used the callback approach can allocate a lot of
    memory to the search request.</p>

Asking for (member=*) is OK - the directory uses the equality matching rule
  which is defined for the member attribute.
<p class="Pp">Asking for (member=c*) is not OK - there is no defined substring
    matching rule for the member attribute. That's because the member values are
    *not* strings, but distinguished names. There is no substring matching rule
    for DNs, see RFC 4519 section 2.7.</p>
<p class="Pp">What you have to do is get the results of (member=*) and then
    select the required results from the returned values. You need to do this
    using knowledge of the string representation of DNs defined in RFC 4514,
    which is important because the same DN can have different string
    representations. So you need to perform some canonicalization if you want to
    be correct.</p>

It is an error to delete an attribute that doesn't exist. When you get the error
  back the server ignores the entire modify operation you sent it, so you need
  to make sure the error doesn't happen.
<p class="Pp">Another approach, if you are using LDAPv3 (note beginning with
    version .27 Net::LDAP uses LDAPv3 by default) is to use a 'replace' with
    your attribute name and no values. In LDAPv3, this is defined to always work

Since this is a proprietary feature, you will have to check your server's
  documentation. You might find that you need to use a control. If there is a

  use. For proper operation you will need the oid number for ManageDsaIT;
  2.16.840.1.113730.3.4.2 and do not specify a value for type.

  do I reset a user's password ...</a></h2>
<i>... in most LDAP servers?</i>
<p class="Pp">Most LDAP servers use the standard userPassword attribute as the
    attribute to set when you want to change a user's password.</p>
<p class="Pp">They usually allow to set the password either using the regular
    modify operation on the userPassword attribute or using the extended LDAP
    Password Modify operation defined in RFC3062.</p>
<p class="Pp">The recommended method is the extended Password Modify operation,
    which offers a standardized way to set user passwords but unfortunately is
    not available on all LDAP servers.</p>
<p class="Pp">Whether the extended Password Modify operation is available can be
    found out by searching the attribute supportedExtension for the value
    1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.1.11.1 in the RootDSE object.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the extended Password Modify operation is not available the
    alternative is the regular modification of the userPassword attribute.</p>
<p class="Pp">But this method has some drawbacks:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Depending on the type of the server the arguments to the modify operations
      may vary. Some want the modify done with replace, some want it done by
      explicitly deleting the old password and add of the new one. This may even
      depend on whether you change the password for the bound user or as an
      administrator for another user.</li>
  <li>With the modify operation some servers expect the client to do the hashing
      of the password on the client side. I.e. all clients that set passwords
      need to agree on the algorithm and the format of the hashed password.</li>
  <li>Some LDAP servers do not allow setting the password if the connection is
      not sufficiently secured. I.e. require SSL or TLS support to set the
      password (which is heavily recommended anyway ;-)</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">Here is an example of how to change your own password (for
    brevity's sake error checking is left out):</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  use Net::LDAP;

  my $ldap = Net::LDAP-&gt;new('ldaps://server.domain')  or  die &quot;$@&quot;;

  $ldap-&gt;unbind();
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><i>... in MS Active Directory?</i></p>
<p class="Pp">With Active Directory a user's password is stored in the
    unicodePwd attribute and changed using the regular modify operation.</p>
<p class="Pp">ADS expects this password to be encoded in Unicode - UTF-16 to be
    exact. Before the Unicode conversion is done the password needs to be
    surrounded by double quotes which do not belong to the user's password.</p>
<p class="Pp">For the password modify operation to succeed SSL is required.</p>
<p class="Pp">When changing the password for the user bound to the directory ADS
    expects it to be done by deleting the old password and adding the new one.
    When doing it as a user with administrative privileges replacing the
    unicodePwd's value with a new one is allowed too.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl-ldap contains convenience methods for Active Directory that
    allow one to perform this task very easily.</p>
<p class="Pp">Here's an example that demonstrates setting your own password from
    <span class="Li">$oldPW</span> to <span class="Li">$newPW</span> (again

  can I simulate server failover?</a></h2>
Perl-ldap does not do server failover, however there are several programming
  options for getting around this situation.
<p class="Pp">Here is one possible solution:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  $ldaps = Net::LDAPS-&gt;new([ $ldapserverone, $ldapservertwo ],
                           port=&gt;636, timeout=&gt;5)  or  die &quot;$@&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">For perl-ldap versions before 0.27, the same goal can be achieved
    using:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  unless ( $ldaps =
            Net::LDAPS-&gt;new($ldapserverone,
                            port=&gt;636,timeout=&gt;5) )
          {
              $ldaps = Net::LDAPS-&gt;new($ldapservertwo,
                                       port=&gt;636,timeout=&gt;20) ||
              return
              &quot;Can't connect to $ldapserverone or $ldapservertwo via LDAPS: $@&quot;;
          }

<h1 class="Sh" id="Using_X.509_certificates."><a class="permalink" href="#Using_X.509_certificates.">Using

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="How_do_I_store_X.509_certificates_in_the_directory?"><a class="permalink" href="#How_do_I_store_X.509_certificates_in_the_directory?">How
  do I store X.509 certificates in the directory?</a></h2>
The first problem here is that there are many different formats to hold
  certificates in, for example PEM, DER, PKCS#7 and PKCS#12. The directory
  <b>only</b> uses the DER format (more correctly, it only uses the BER format)
  which is a binary format.
<p class="Pp">Your first job is to ensure that your certificates are therefore
    in DER/BER format. You could use OpenSSL to convert from PEM like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  openssl x509 -inform PEM -in cert.pem -outform DER -out cert.der
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Consult the OpenSSL documentation to find out how to perform other
    conversions.</p>
<p class="Pp">To add a certificate to the directory, just slurp in the DER/BER
    certificate into a scalar variable, and add it to the entry's
    userCertificate attribute. How you do that will depend on which version of
    LDAP you are using.</p>
<p class="Pp">To slurp in the certificate try something like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  my $cert;
  {
      local $/ = undef; # Slurp mode
      open CERT, &quot;cert.der&quot; or die;
      binmode CERT;     # for Windows e.a.
      $cert = &lt;CERT&gt;;
      close CERT;
  }
  # The certificate is now in $cert
</pre>
<p class="Pp">For LDAPv2, because most directory vendors ignore the string
    representation of certificates defined in RFC 1778, you should add this
    value to the directory like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  $res = $ldap-&gt;modify(&quot;cn=My User, o=My Company,c=XY&quot;,
                       add =&gt; [
                               'userCertificate' =&gt; [ $cert ]
                              ]);
  die &quot;Modify failed (&quot; . ldap_error_name($res-&gt;code) . &quot;)\n&quot;
      if $res-&gt;code;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">For LDAPv3, you must do this instead:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  $res = $ldap-&gt;modify(&quot;cn=My User, o=My Company, c=XY&quot;,
                       add =&gt; [
                               'userCertificate;binary' =&gt; [ $cert ]
                              ]);
  die &quot;Modify failed (&quot; . ldap_error_name($res-&gt;code) . &quot;)\n&quot;
      if $res-&gt;code;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Of course, the entry you are trying to add the certificate to must
    use object classes that permit the userCertificate attribute, otherwise the
    modify will fail with an object class violation error. The inetOrgPerson
    structural object class permits userCertificates, as does the
    strongAuthenticationUser auxiliary object class. Others might also.</p>

  do I search objects by the contents of certificates.</a></h2>
The directory needs to support one or more of the certificate*Match matching
  rules.
<p class="Pp">Then using the filter (for certificateExactMatch)</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  (userCertificate={ serialNumber 1234, issuer &quot;cn=CA,o=TrustCenter&quot; })
</pre>
<p class="Pp">allows searching for the objects containing the attribute
    userCertificate with a certificate matching these criteria.</p>
<p class="Pp">Please note that the exact syntax of the values for the
    serialNumber and the issuer above may depend on the LDAP server. In any case
