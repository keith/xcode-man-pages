<p class="Pp">As of Perl 5.9.5 there is a new interface for plugging and using
    regular expression engines other than the default one.</p>
<p class="Pp">Each engine is supposed to provide access to a constant structure
    of the following format:</p>

<p class="Pp">When a regexp is compiled, its
    <span class="Li">&quot;engine&quot;</span> field is then set to point at the
    appropriate structure, so that when it needs to be used Perl can find the
    right routines to do so.</p>
<p class="Pp">In order to install a new regexp handler,
    <span class="Li">$^H{regcomp}</span> is set to an integer which (when casted
    appropriately) resolves to one of these structures. When compiling, the
    <span class="Li">&quot;comp&quot;</span> method is executed, and the
    resulting <span class="Li">&quot;regexp&quot;</span> structure's engine
    field is expected to point back at the same structure.</p>
<p class="Pp">The pTHX_ symbol in the definition is a macro used by Perl under
    threading to provide an extra argument to the routine holding a pointer back
    to the interpreter that is executing the regexp. So under threading all
    routines get an extra argument.</p>

<pre>    REGEXP* comp(pTHX_ const SV * const pattern, const U32 flags);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Compile the pattern stored in
    <span class="Li">&quot;pattern&quot;</span> using the given
    <span class="Li">&quot;flags&quot;</span> and return a pointer to a prepared
    <span class="Li">&quot;REGEXP&quot;</span> structure that can perform the
    match. See &quot;The REGEXP structure&quot; below for an explanation of the
    individual fields in the REGEXP struct.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;pattern&quot;</span> parameter is the
    scalar that was used as the pattern. Previous versions of Perl would pass
    two <span class="Li">&quot;char*&quot;</span> indicating the start and end
    of the stringified pattern; the following snippet can be used to get the old
    parameters:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    STRLEN plen;
    char*  exp = SvPV(pattern, plen);
    char* xend = exp + plen;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Since any scalar can be passed as a pattern, it's possible to
    implement an engine that does something with an array
    (<span class="Li">&quot;&quot;ook&quot; =~ [ qw/ eek</span>
    <span class="Li">hlagh / ]&quot;</span>) or with the non-stringified form of
    a compiled regular expression (<span class="Li">&quot;&quot;ook&quot; =~
    qr/eek/&quot;</span>). Perl's own engine will always stringify everything
    using the snippet above, but that doesn't mean other engines have to.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;flags&quot;</span> parameter is a
    bitfield which indicates which of the
    <span class="Li">&quot;msixp&quot;</span> flags the regex was compiled with.
    It also contains additional info, such as if <span class="Li">&quot;use
    locale&quot;</span> is in effect.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;eogc&quot;</span> flags are stripped
    out before being passed to the comp routine. The regex engine does not need
    to know if any of these are set, as those flags should only affect what Perl
    does with the pattern and its match variables, not how it gets compiled and
    executed.</p>
<p class="Pp">By the time the comp callback is called, some of these flags have
    already had effect (noted below where applicable). However most of their
    effect occurs after the comp callback has run, in routines that read the
    <span class="Li">&quot;rx-&gt;extflags&quot;</span> field which it
    populates.</p>
<p class="Pp">In general the flags should be preserved in
    <span class="Li">&quot;rx-&gt;extflags&quot;</span> after compilation,
    although the regex engine might want to add or delete some of them to invoke
    or disable some special behavior in Perl. The flags along with any special
    behavior they cause are documented below:</p>
<p class="Pp">The pattern modifiers:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>&quot;/m&quot; - RXf_PMf_MULTILINE</dt>
  <dd>If this is in <span class="Li">&quot;rx-&gt;extflags&quot;</span> it will
      be passed to <span class="Li">&quot;Perl_fbm_instr&quot;</span> by
      <span class="Li">&quot;pp_split&quot;</span> which will treat the subject
      string as a multi-line string.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;/s&quot; - RXf_PMf_SINGLELINE</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>&quot;/i&quot; - RXf_PMf_FOLD</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>&quot;/x&quot; - RXf_PMf_EXTENDED</dt>
  <dd>If present on a regex, <span class="Li">&quot;#&quot;</span> comments will
      be handled differently by the tokenizer in some cases.
    <p class="Pp">TODO: Document those cases.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>&quot;/p&quot; - RXf_PMf_KEEPCOPY</dt>
  <dd>TODO: Document this</dd>
  <dt id="Character"><a class="permalink" href="#Character">Character
    set</a></dt>
  <dd>The character set semantics are determined by an enum that is contained in
      this field. This is still experimental and subject to change, but the
      current interface returns the rules by use of the in-line function
      <span class="Li">&quot;get_regex_charset(const U32 flags)&quot;</span>.
      The only currently documented value returned from it is
      REGEX_LOCALE_CHARSET, which is set if <span class="Li">&quot;use
      locale&quot;</span> is in effect. If present in
      <span class="Li">&quot;rx-&gt;extflags&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;split&quot;</span> will use the locale dependent
      definition of whitespace when RXf_SKIPWHITE or RXf_WHITE is in effect.
      ASCII whitespace is defined as per isSPACE, and by the internal macros
      <span class="Li">&quot;is_utf8_space&quot;</span> under UTF-8, and
      <span class="Li">&quot;isSPACE_LC&quot;</span> under
      <span class="Li">&quot;use</span>
    <span class="Li">locale&quot;</span>.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Additional flags:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="RXf_SPLIT"><a class="permalink" href="#RXf_SPLIT">RXf_SPLIT</a></dt>
  <dd>This flag was removed in perl 5.18.0. <span class="Li">&quot;split '
      '&quot;</span> is now special-cased solely in the parser. RXf_SPLIT is
      still #defined, so you can test for it. This is how it used to work:
    <p class="Pp">If <span class="Li">&quot;split&quot;</span> is invoked as
        <span class="Li">&quot;split ' '&quot;</span> or with no arguments
        (which really means <span class="Li">&quot;split(' ', $_)&quot;</span>,
        see split), Perl will set this flag. The regex engine can then check for
        it and set the SKIPWHITE and WHITE extflags. To do this, the Perl engine
        does:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    if (flags &amp; RXf_SPLIT &amp;&amp; r-&gt;prelen == 1 &amp;&amp; r-&gt;precomp[0] == ' ')
        r-&gt;extflags |= (RXf_SKIPWHITE|RXf_WHITE);
    </pre>
  </dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">These flags can be set during compilation to enable optimizations
    in the <span class="Li">&quot;split&quot;</span> operator.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="RXf_SKIPWHITE"><a class="permalink" href="#RXf_SKIPWHITE">RXf_SKIPWHITE</a></dt>
  <dd>This flag was removed in perl 5.18.0. It is still #defined, so you can set
      it, but doing so will have no effect. This is how it used to work:
    <p class="Pp">If the flag is present in
        <span class="Li">&quot;rx-&gt;extflags&quot;</span>
        <span class="Li">&quot;split&quot;</span> will delete whitespace from
        the start of the subject string before it's operated on. What is
        considered whitespace depends on if the subject is a UTF-8 string and if
        the <span class="Li">&quot;RXf_PMf_LOCALE&quot;</span> flag is set.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If RXf_WHITE is set in addition to this flag,
        <span class="Li">&quot;split&quot;</span> will behave like
        <span class="Li">&quot;split &quot; &quot;&quot;</span> under the Perl
        engine.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="RXf_START_ONLY"><a class="permalink" href="#RXf_START_ONLY">RXf_START_ONLY</a></dt>
  <dd>Tells the split operator to split the target string on newlines
      (<span class="Li">&quot;\n&quot;</span>) without invoking the regex
      engine.
    <p class="Pp">Perl's engine sets this if the pattern is
        <span class="Li">&quot;/^/&quot;</span> (<span class="Li">&quot;plen ==
        1 &amp;&amp; *exp</span> <span class="Li">== '^'&quot;</span>), even
        under <span class="Li">&quot;/^/s&quot;</span>; see split. Of course a
        different regex engine might want to use the same optimizations with a
        different syntax.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="RXf_WHITE"><a class="permalink" href="#RXf_WHITE">RXf_WHITE</a></dt>
  <dd>Tells the split operator to split the target string on whitespace without
      invoking the regex engine. The definition of whitespace varies depending
      on if the target string is a UTF-8 string and on if RXf_PMf_LOCALE is set.
    <p class="Pp">Perl's engine sets this flag if the pattern is
        <span class="Li">&quot;\s+&quot;</span>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="RXf_NULL"><a class="permalink" href="#RXf_NULL">RXf_NULL</a></dt>
  <dd>Tells the split operator to split the target string on characters. The
      definition of character varies depending on if the target string is a
      UTF-8 string.
    <p class="Pp">Perl's engine sets this flag on empty patterns, this
        optimization makes <span class="Li">&quot;split //&quot;</span> much
        faster than it would otherwise be. It's even faster than
        <span class="Li">&quot;unpack&quot;</span>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="RXf_NO_INPLACE_SUBST"><a class="permalink" href="#RXf_NO_INPLACE_SUBST">RXf_NO_INPLACE_SUBST</a></dt>
  <dd>Added in perl 5.18.0, this flag indicates that a regular expression might
      perform an operation that would interfere with inplace substituion. For
      instance it might contain lookbehind, or assign to non-magical variables
      (such as <span class="Li">$REGMARK</span> and
      <span class="Li">$REGERROR</span>) during matching.
      <span class="Li">&quot;s///&quot;</span> will skip certain optimisations

        # 'paren' will be '1' and 'value' will be 'ee'
        $1 =~ tr/o/e/;

<p class="Pp">Perl's own engine will croak on any attempt to modify the capture

<p class="Pp">Actually Perl will not <i>always</i> croak in a statement that
    looks like it would modify a numbered capture variable. This is because the
    STORE callback will not be called if Perl can determine that it doesn't have
    to modify the value. This is exactly how tied variables behave in the same
    situation:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    package CaptureVar;

    tie my $sv =&gt; &quot;CaptureVar&quot;;

</pre>
<p class="Pp">Because <span class="Li">$sv</span> is
    <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> when the
    <span class="Li">&quot;y///&quot;</span> operator is applied to it, the
    transliteration won't actually execute and the program won't
    <span class="Li">&quot;die&quot;</span>. This is different to how 5.8 and
    earlier versions behaved since the capture variables were READONLY variables
    then; now they'll just die when assigned to in the default engine.</p>

<p class="Pp">Get the <span class="Li">&quot;length&quot;</span> of a capture
    variable. There's a special callback for this so that Perl doesn't have to

    since the length is (in Perl's case) known from an offset stored in
    <span class="Li">&quot;rx-&gt;offs&quot;</span>, this is much more

<p class="Pp">The minimum string length (in characters) required for the pattern

    any closer to the end of a string than would allow a match. For instance
    there is no point in even starting the regex engine if the minlen is 10 but
    the string is only 5 characters long. There is no way that the pattern can
    match.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;minlenret&quot;</span> is the minimum
    length (in characters) of the string that would be found in $&amp; after a

<p class="Pp">The difference between <span class="Li">&quot;minlen&quot;</span>

    but <span class="Li">&quot;minlenret&quot;</span> would only be 2 as the \d
    is required to match but is not actually included in the matched content.
    This distinction is particularly important as the substitution logic uses

    <span class="Li">&quot;RX_OFFS&quot;</span> start and end indices index into
    this buffer.</p>
<p class="Pp">In the presence of the
    <span class="Li">&quot;REXEC_COPY_STR&quot;</span> flag, but with the
    addition of the <span class="Li">&quot;REXEC_COPY_SKIP_PRE&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;REXEC_COPY_SKIP_POST&quot;</span> flags, an engine
    can choose not to copy the full buffer (although it must still do so in the
    presence of <span class="Li">&quot;RXf_PMf_KEEPCOPY&quot;</span> or the
    relevant bits being set in
    <span class="Li">&quot;PL_sawampersand&quot;</span>). In this case, it may
    set <span class="Li">&quot;suboffset&quot;</span> to indicate the number of
    bytes from the logical start of the buffer to the physical start (i.e.
    <span class="Li">&quot;subbeg&quot;</span>). It should also set
    <span class="Li">&quot;subcoffset&quot;</span>, the number of characters in
    the offset. The latter is needed to support
    <span class="Li">&quot;@-&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;@+&quot;</span> which work in characters, not
  bytes.</p>

  &quot;wraplen&quot;</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Stores the string <span class="Li">&quot;qr//&quot;</span>
    stringifies to. The Perl engine for example stores
    <span class="Li">&quot;(?^:eek)&quot;</span> in the case of
    <span class="Li">&quot;qr/eek/&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">When using a custom engine that doesn't support the
    <span class="Li">&quot;(?:)&quot;</span> construct for inline modifiers,
    it's probably best to have <span class="Li">&quot;qr//&quot;</span>
    stringify to the supplied pattern, note that this will create undesired
    patterns in cases such as:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    my $x = qr/a|b/;  # &quot;a|b&quot;
    my $y = qr/c/i;   # &quot;c&quot;
    my $z = qr/$x$y/; # &quot;a|bc&quot;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">There's no solution for this problem other than making the custom
    engine understand a construct like
  <span class="Li">&quot;(?:)&quot;</span>.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="_seen_evals_"><a class="permalink" href="#_seen_evals_">&quot;seen_evals&quot;</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">This stores the number of eval groups in the pattern. This is used
    for security purposes when embedding compiled regexes into larger patterns
    with <span class="Li">&quot;qr//&quot;</span>.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="_refcnt_"><a class="permalink" href="#_refcnt_">&quot;refcnt&quot;</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The number of times the structure is referenced. When this falls
    to 0, the regexp is automatically freed by a call to pregfree. This should
    be set to 1 in each engine's &quot;comp&quot; routine.</p>
