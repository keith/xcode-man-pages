<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
&quot;Spiffy&quot; is a framework and methodology for doing object oriented (OO)
  programming in Perl. Spiffy combines the best parts of Exporter.pm, base.pm,
  mixin.pm and SUPER.pm into one magic foundation class. It attempts to fix all
  the nits and warts of traditional Perl OO, in a clean, straightforward and
  (perhaps someday) standard way.
<p class="Pp">Spiffy borrows ideas from other OO languages like Python, Ruby,
    Java and Perl 6. It also adds a few tricks of its own.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you take a look on CPAN, there are a ton of OO related modules.
    When starting a new project, you need to pick the set of modules that makes
    most sense, and then you need to use those modules in each of your classes.
    Spiffy, on the other hand, has everything you'll probably need in one
    module, and you only need to use it once in one of your classes. If you make
    Spiffy.pm the base class of the basest class in your project, Spiffy will
    automatically pass all of its magic to all of your subclasses. You may
    eventually forget that you're even using it!</p>
<p class="Pp">The most striking difference between Spiffy and other Perl object
    oriented base classes, is that it has the ability to export things. If you
    create a subclass of Spiffy, all the things that Spiffy exports will
    automatically be exported by your subclass, in addition to any more things
    that you want to export. And if someone creates a subclass of your subclass,
    all of those things will be exported automatically, and so on. Think of it
    as &quot;Inherited Exportation&quot;, and it uses the familiar Exporter.pm
    specification syntax.</p>
<p class="Pp">To use Spiffy or any subclass of Spiffy as a base class of your
    class, you specify the <span class="Li">&quot;-base&quot;</span> argument to
    the <span class="Li">&quot;use&quot;</span> command.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    use MySpiffyBaseModule -base;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">You can also use the traditional <span class="Li">&quot;use base
    'MySpiffyBaseModule';&quot;</span> syntax and everything will work exactly
    the same. The only caveat is that Spiffy.pm must already be loaded. That's
    because Spiffy rewires base.pm on the fly to do all the Spiffy magics.</p>
<p class="Pp">Spiffy has support for Ruby-like mixins with Perl6-like roles.
    Just like <span class="Li">&quot;base&quot;</span> you can use either of the
    following invocations:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    use mixin 'MySpiffyBaseModule';
    use MySpiffyBaseModule -mixin;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The second version will only work if the class being mixed in is a
    subclass of Spiffy. The first version will work in all cases, as long as
    Spiffy has already been loaded.</p>
<p class="Pp">To limit the methods that get mixed in, use roles. (Hint: they
    work just like an Exporter list):</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    use MySpiffyBaseModule -mixin =&gt; qw(:basics x y !foo);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">In object oriented Perl almost every subroutine is a method. Each
    method gets the object passed to it as its first argument. That means
    practically every subroutine starts with the line:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    my $self = shift;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Spiffy provides a simple, optional filter mechanism to insert that
    line for you, resulting in cleaner code. If you figure an average method has
    10 lines of code, that's 10% of your code! To turn this option on, you just
    use the <span class="Li">&quot;-</span> <span class="Li">Base&quot;</span>
    option instead of the <span class="Li">&quot;-base&quot;</span> option, or
    add the <span class="Li">&quot;-selfless&quot;</span> option. If source
    filtering makes you queazy, don't use the feature. I personally find it
    addictive in my quest for writing squeaky clean, maintainable code.</p>
<p class="Pp">A useful feature of Spiffy is that it exports two functions:
    <span class="Li">&quot;field&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;const&quot;</span> that can be used to declare the
    attributes of your class, and automatically generate accessor methods for
    them. The only difference between the two functions is that
    <span class="Li">&quot;const&quot;</span> attributes can not be modified;
    thus the accessor is much faster.</p>
<p class="Pp">One interesting aspect of OO programming is when a method calls
    the same method from a parent class. This is generally known as calling a
    super method. Perl's facility for doing this is butt ugly:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    sub cleanup {
        my $self = shift;
        $self-&gt;scrub;
        $self-&gt;SUPER::cleanup(@_);
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Spiffy makes it, er, super easy to call super methods. You just
    use the <span class="Li">&quot;super&quot;</span> function. You don't need
    to pass it any arguments because it automatically passes them on for you.
    Here's the same function with Spiffy:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    sub cleanup {
        $self-&gt;scrub;
        super;
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Spiffy has a special method for parsing arguments called
    <span class="Li">&quot;parse_arguments&quot;</span>, that it also uses for
    parsing its own arguments. You declare which arguments are boolean
    (singletons) and which ones are paired, with two special methods called
    <span class="Li">&quot;boolean_arguments&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;paired_arguments&quot;</span>. Parse arguments pulls
    out the booleans and pairs and returns them in an anonymous hash, followed
    by a list of the unmatched arguments.</p>
<p class="Pp">Finally, Spiffy can export a few debugging functions
    <span class="Li">&quot;WWW&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;XXX&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;YYY&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;ZZZ&quot;</span>. Each of them produces a YAML dump
    of its arguments. WWW warns the output, XXX dies with the output, YYY prints
    the output, and ZZZ confesses the output. If YAML doesn't suit your needs,
    you can switch all the dumps to Data::Dumper format with the
    <span class="Li">&quot;-dumper&quot;</span> option.</p>
<p class="Pp">That's Spiffy!</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="EXPORTING"><a class="permalink" href="#EXPORTING">EXPORTING</a></h1>
Spiffy implements a completely new idea in Perl. Modules that act both as object
  oriented classes and that also export functions. But it takes the concept of
  Exporter.pm one step further; it walks the entire <span class="Li">@ISA</span>
  path of a class and honors the export specifications of each module. Since
  Spiffy calls on the Exporter module to do this, you can use all the fancy
  interface features that Exporter has, including tags and negation.
<p class="Pp">Spiffy considers all the arguments that don't begin with a dash to
    comprise the export specification.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    package Vehicle;
    use Spiffy -base;
    our $SERIAL_NUMBER = 0;
    our @EXPORT = qw($SERIAL_NUMBER);
    our @EXPORT_BASE = qw(tire horn);

    package Bicycle;
    use Vehicle -base, '!field';
    $self-&gt;inflate(tire);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">In this case,
    <span class="Li">&quot;Bicycle-&gt;isa('Vehicle')&quot;</span> and also all
    the things that <span class="Li">&quot;Vehicle&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;Spiffy&quot;</span> export, will go into
    <span class="Li">&quot;Bicycle&quot;</span>, except
    <span class="Li">&quot;field&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Exporting can be very helpful when you've designed a system with
    hundreds of classes, and you want them all to have access to some functions
    or constants</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
      or variables. Just export them in your main base class and every subclass
</pre>
<p class="Pp">will get the functions they need.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can do almost everything that Exporter does because Spiffy
    delegates the job to Exporter (after adding some Spiffy magic). Spiffy
    offers a <span class="Li">@EXPORT_BASE</span> variable which is like
    <span class="Li">@EXPORT</span>, but only for usages that use
    <span class="Li">&quot;-base&quot;</span>.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="MIXINS_&amp;_ROLES"><a class="permalink" href="#MIXINS_&amp;_ROLES">MIXINS
  &amp; ROLES</a></h1>
If you've done much OO programming in Perl you've probably used Multiple
  Inheritance (MI), and if you've done much MI you've probably run into weird
  problems and headaches. Some languages like Ruby, attempt to resolve MI issues
  using a technique called mixins. Basically, all Ruby classes use only Single
  Inheritance (SI), and then <i>mixin</i> functionality from other modules if
  they need to.
<p class="Pp">Mixins can be thought of at a simplistic level as <i>importing</i>
    the methods of another class into your subclass. But from an implementation
    standpoint that's not the best way to do it. Spiffy does what Ruby does. It
    creates an empty anonymous class, imports everything into that class, and
    then chains the new class into your SI ISA path. In other words, if you
  say:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    package AAA;
    use BBB -base;
    use CCC -mixin;
    use DDD -mixin;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">You end up with a single inheritance chain of classes like
  this:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    AAA &lt;&lt; AAA-DDD &lt;&lt; AAA-CCC &lt;&lt; BBB;
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;AAA-DDD&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;AAA-CCC&quot;</span> are the actual package names of
    the generated classes. The nice thing about this style is that mixing in CCC
    doesn't clobber any methods in AAA, and DDD doesn't conflict with AAA or CCC
    either. If you mixed in a method in CCC that was also in AAA, you can still
    get to it by using <span class="Li">&quot;super&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">When Spiffy mixes in CCC, it pulls in all the methods in CCC that
    do not begin with an underscore. Actually it goes farther than that. If CCC
    is a subclass it will pull in every method that CCC
    <span class="Li">&quot;can&quot;</span> do through inheritance. This is very
    powerful, maybe too powerful.</p>
<p class="Pp">To limit what you mixin, Spiffy borrows the concept of Roles from
    Perl6. The term role is used more loosely in Spiffy though. It's much like
    an import list that the Exporter module uses, and you can use groups (tags)
    and negation. If the first element of your list uses negation, Spiffy will
    start with all the methods that your mixin class can do.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    use EEE -mixin =&gt; qw(:tools walk !run !:sharp_tools);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">In this example, <span class="Li">&quot;walk&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;run&quot;</span> are methods that EEE can do, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;tools&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;sharp_tools&quot;</span> are roles of class EEE. How
    does class EEE define these roles? It very simply defines methods called
    <span class="Li">&quot;_role_tools&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;_role_sharp_tools&quot;</span> which return lists of
    more methods. (And possibly other roles!) The neat thing here is that since
    roles are just methods, they too can be inherited. Take <b>that</b>
  Perl6!</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="FILTERING"><a class="permalink" href="#FILTERING">FILTERING</a></h1>
By using the <span class="Li">&quot;-Base&quot;</span> flag instead of
  <span class="Li">&quot;-base&quot;</span> you never need to write the line:
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    my $self = shift;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This statement is added to every subroutine in your class by using
    a source filter. The magic is simple and fast, so there is litte performance
    penalty for creating clean code on par with Ruby and Python.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    package Example;
    use Spiffy -Base;

    sub crazy {
        $self-&gt;nuts;
    }
    sub wacky { }
    sub new() {
        bless [], shift;
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">is exactly the same as:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    package Example;
    use Spiffy -base;
    use strict;use warnings;
    sub crazy {my $self = shift;
        $self-&gt;nuts;
    }
    sub wacky {my $self = shift; }
    sub new {
        bless [], shift;
    }
    ;1;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Note that the empty parens after the subroutine
    <span class="Li">&quot;new&quot;</span> keep it from having a
    <span class="Li">$self</span> added. Also note that the extra code is added
    to existing lines to ensure that line numbers are not altered.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;-Base&quot;</span> also turns on the strict
    and warnings pragmas, and adds that annoying '1;' line to your module.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="PRIVATE_METHODS"><a class="permalink" href="#PRIVATE_METHODS">PRIVATE
  METHODS</a></h1>
Spiffy now has support for private methods when you use the '-Base' filter
  mechanism. You just declare the subs with the
  <span class="Li">&quot;my&quot;</span> keyword, and call them with a
  <span class="Li">'$'</span> in front. Like this:
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    package Keen;
    use SomethingSpiffy -Base;

    # normal public method
    sub swell {
        $self-&gt;$stinky;
    }

    # private lexical method. uncallable from outside this file.
    my sub stinky {
        ...
    }

<h1 class="Sh" id="SPIFFY_DEBUGGING"><a class="permalink" href="#SPIFFY_DEBUGGING">SPIFFY
  DEBUGGING</a></h1>
The XXX function is very handy for debugging because you can insert it almost
  anywhere, and it will dump your data in nice clean YAML. Take the following
  statement:
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    my @stuff = grep { /keen/ } $self-&gt;find($a, $b);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If you have a problem with this statement, you can debug it in any
    of the following ways:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    XXX my @stuff = grep { /keen/ } $self-&gt;find($a, $b);
    my @stuff = XXX grep { /keen/ } $self-&gt;find($a, $b);
    my @stuff = grep { /keen/ } XXX $self-&gt;find($a, $b);
    my @stuff = grep { /keen/ } $self-&gt;find(XXX $a, $b);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">XXX is easy to insert and remove. It is also a tradition to mark
    uncertain areas of code with XXX. This will make the debugging dumpers easy
    to spot if you forget to take them out.</p>
<p class="Pp">WWW and YYY are nice because they dump their arguments and then
    return the arguments. This way you can insert them into many places and
    still have the code run as before. Use ZZZ when you need to die with both a
    YAML dump and a full stack trace.</p>
<p class="Pp">The debugging functions are exported by default if you use the
    <span class="Li">&quot;-base&quot;</span> option, but only if you have
    previously used the <span class="Li">&quot;-XXX&quot;</span> option. To
    export all 4 functions use the export tag:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    use SomeSpiffyModule ':XXX';
</pre>
<p class="Pp">To force the debugging functions to use Data::Dumper instead of
    YAML:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    use SomeSpiffyModule -dumper;
</pre>

This section describes the functions the Spiffy exports. The
  <span class="Li">&quot;field&quot;</span>,
  <span class="Li">&quot;const&quot;</span>,
  <span class="Li">&quot;stub&quot;</span> and
  <span class="Li">&quot;super&quot;</span> functions are only exported when you
  use the <span class="Li">&quot;-base&quot;</span> or
  <span class="Li">&quot;-Base&quot;</span> options.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>field</dt>
  <dd>Defines accessor methods for a field of your class:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    package Example;
    use Spiffy -Base;

    field 'foo';
    field bar =&gt; [];

    sub lalala {
        $self-&gt;foo(42);
        push @{$self-&gt;{bar}}, $self-&gt;foo;
    }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The first parameter passed to
        <span class="Li">&quot;field&quot;</span> is the name of the attribute
        being defined. Accessors can be given an optional default value. This
        value will be returned if no value for the field has been set in the
        object.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>const</dt>
  <dd><span class="Li"></span>
    <pre>
    const bar =&gt; 42;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;const&quot;</span> function is
        similar to &lt;field&gt; except that it is immutable. It also does not
        store data in the object. You probably always want to give a
        <span class="Li">&quot;const&quot;</span> a default value, otherwise the
        generated method will be somewhat useless.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>stub</dt>
  <dd><span class="Li"></span>
    <pre>
    stub 'cigar';
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;stub&quot;</span> function
        generates a method that will die with an appropriate message. The idea
        is that subclasses must implement these methods so that the stub methods
        don't get called.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>super</dt>
  <dd>If this function is called without any arguments, it will call the same
      method that it is in, higher up in the ISA tree, passing it all the same
      arguments. If it is called with arguments, it will use those arguments
      with <span class="Li">$self</span> in the front. In other words, it just
      works like you'd expect.
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    sub foo {
        super;             # Same as $self-&gt;SUPER::foo(@_);

    }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;super&quot;</span> will simply do
        nothing if there is no super method. Finally,

This section lists all of the methods that any subclass of Spiffy automatically
  inherits.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>mixin</dt>
  <dd>A method to mixin a class at runtime. Takes the same arguments as
      <span class="Li">&quot;use mixin</span> <span class="Li">...&quot;</span>.
      Makes the target class a mixin of the caller.
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    $self-&gt;mixin('SomeClass');
    $object-&gt;mixin('SomeOtherClass' =&gt; 'some_method');
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>parse_arguments</dt>
  <dd>This method takes a list of arguments and groups them into pairs. It
      allows for boolean arguments which may or may not have a value (defaulting
      to 1). The method returns a hash reference of all the pairs as keys and
      values in the hash. Any arguments that cannot be paired, are returned as a
      list. Here is an example:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    sub boolean_arguments { qw(-has_spots -is_yummy) }
    sub paired_arguments { qw(-name -size) }

        -size =&gt; 'large',
        'black',
        -is_yummy =&gt; 0,
    );
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">After this call, <span class="Li">$pairs</span> will
      contain:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>

When you <span class="Li">&quot;use&quot;</span> the Spiffy module or a subclass
  of it, you can pass it a list of arguments. These arguments are parsed using
  the <span class="Li">&quot;parse_arguments&quot;</span> method described
  above. The special argument <span class="Li">&quot;-base&quot;</span>, is used
  to make the current package a subclass of the Spiffy module being used.
<p class="Pp">Any non-paired parameters act like a normal import list; just like
    those used with the Exporter module.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="USING_SPIFFY_WITH_BASE.PM"><a class="permalink" href="#USING_SPIFFY_WITH_BASE.PM">USING
  SPIFFY WITH BASE.PM</a></h1>
The proper way to use a Spiffy module as a base class is with the
  <span class="Li">&quot;-base&quot;</span> parameter to the
  <span class="Li">&quot;use&quot;</span> statement. This differs from typical
  modules where you would want to <span class="Li">&quot;use base&quot;</span>.
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    package Something;
    use Spiffy::Module -base;
    use base 'NonSpiffy::Module';
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Now it may be hard to keep track of what's Spiffy and what is not.
    Therefore Spiffy has actually been made to work with base.pm. You can
  say:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    package Something;
    use base 'Spiffy::Module';
    use base 'NonSpiffy::Module';
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;use base&quot;</span> is also very useful
    when your class is not an actual module (a separate file) but just a package
    in some file that has already been loaded.
    <span class="Li">&quot;base&quot;</span> will work whether the class is a
    module or not, while the <span class="Li">&quot;-base&quot;</span> syntax
    cannot work that way, since <span class="Li">&quot;use&quot;</span> always
    tries to load a module.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="base.pm_Caveats"><a class="permalink" href="#base.pm_Caveats">base.pm
  Caveats</a></h2>
To make Spiffy work with base.pm, a dirty trick was played. Spiffy swaps
  <span class="Li">&quot;base::import&quot;</span> with its own version. If the
  base modules are not Spiffy, Spiffy calls the original base::import. If the
  base modules are Spiffy, then Spiffy does its own thing.
<p class="Pp">There are two caveats.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>Spiffy must be loaded first.</dt>
  <dd>If Spiffy is not loaded and <span class="Li">&quot;use base&quot;</span>
      is invoked on a Spiffy module, Spiffy will die with a useful message
      telling the author to read this documentation. That's because Spiffy
      needed to do the import swap beforehand.
    <p class="Pp">If you get this error, simply put a statement like this up
        front in your code:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    use Spiffy ();
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>No Mixing</dt>
  <dd><span class="Li">&quot;base.pm&quot;</span> can take multiple arguments.
      And this works with Spiffy as long as all the base classes are Spiffy, or
      they are all non-Spiffy. If they are mixed, Spiffy will die. In this case
      just use separate <span class="Li">&quot;use base&quot;</span>
    statements.</dd>

Spiffy is a wonderful way to do OO programming in Perl, but it is still a work
  in progress. New things will be added, and things that don't work well, might
  be removed.
