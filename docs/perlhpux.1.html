This document describes various features of HP's Unix operating system (HP-UX)
  that will affect how Perl version 5 (hereafter just Perl) is compiled and/or
  runs.

  perl as shipped with HP-UX</a></h2>
Application release September 2001, HP-UX 11.00 is the first to ship with Perl.
  By the time it was perl-5.6.1 in /opt/perl. The first occurrence is on CD
  5012-7954 and can be installed using
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  swinstall -s /cdrom perl
</pre>
<p class="Pp">assuming you have mounted that CD on /cdrom.</p>
<p class="Pp">That build was a portable hppa-1.1 multithread build that supports
    large files compiled with gcc-2.9-hppa-991112.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you perform a new installation, then (a newer) Perl will be
    installed automatically. Pre-installed HP-UX systems now have more recent
    versions of Perl and the updated modules.</p>
<p class="Pp">The official (threaded) builds from HP, as they are shipped on the
    Application DVD/CD's are available on
    &lt;http://www.software.hp.com/portal/swdepot/displayProductInfo.do?productNumber=PERL&gt;
    for both PA-RISC and IPF (Itanium Processor Family). They are built with the
    HP ANSI-C compiler. Up till 5.8.8 that was done by ActiveState.</p>
<p class="Pp">To see what version is included on the DVD (assumed here to be
    mounted on /cdrom), issue this command:</p>

  perl from HP's porting centre</a></h2>
HP porting centre tries to keep up with customer demand and release updates from
  the Open Source community. Having precompiled Perl binaries available is
  obvious, though &quot;up-to-date&quot; is something relative. At the moment of
  writing perl-5.10.1 and 5.28.0 were available.
<p class="Pp">The HP porting centres are limited in what systems they are
    allowed to port to and they usually choose the two most recent OS versions
    available.</p>
<p class="Pp">HP has asked the porting centre to move Open Source binaries from
    /opt to /usr/local, so binaries produced since the start of July 2002 are
    located in /usr/local.</p>
<p class="Pp">One of HP porting centres URL's is
    &lt;http://hpux.connect.org.uk/&gt; The port currently available is built
    with GNU gcc. As porting modern GNU gcc is extremely hard on HP-UX, they are
    stuck at version gcc-4.2.3.</p>

  Perl 5 on HP-UX</a></h2>
When compiling Perl, you must use an ANSI C compiler. The C compiler that ships
  with all HP-UX systems is a K&amp;R compiler that should only be used to build
  new kernels.
<p class="Pp">Perl can be compiled with either HP's ANSI C compiler or with gcc.
    The former is recommended, as not only can it compile Perl with no
    difficulty, but also can take advantage of features listed later that
    require the use of HP compiler-specific command-line flags.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you decide to use gcc, make sure your installation is recent
    and complete, and be sure to read the Perl INSTALL file for more
    gcc-specific details.</p>

The last and final version of PA-RISC is 2.0, HP no longer sells any system with
  these CPU's.
<p class="Pp">HP's HP9000 Unix systems run on HP's own Precision Architecture
    (PA-RISC) chip. HP-UX used to run on the Motorola MC68000 family of chips,
    but any machine with this chip in it is quite obsolete and this document
    will not attempt to address issues for compiling Perl on the Motorola
    chipset. Even though PA-RISC hardware is not sold anymore, a lot of machines
    still running on these CPU's can be found in the wild.</p>
<p class="Pp">The last order date for HP 9000 systems was December 31, 2008.</p>
<p class="Pp">HP PA-RISC systems are usually referred to with model description
    &quot;HP 9000&quot;. The last CPU in this series is the PA-8900. Support for
    PA-RISC architectured machines officially ended as shown in the following

An executable compiled on a PA-RISC 2.0 platform will not execute on a PA-RISC
  1.1 platform, even if they are running the same version of HP-UX. If you are
  building Perl on a PA-RISC 2.0 platform and want that Perl to also run on a
  PA-RISC 1.1, the compiler flags +DAportable and +DS32 should be used.
<p class="Pp">It is no longer possible to compile PA-RISC 1.0 executables on
    either the PA-RISC 1.1 or 2.0 platforms. The command-line flags are
    accepted, but the resulting executable will not run when transferred to a
    PA-RISC 1.0 system.</p>

HP-UX also runs on the newer Itanium processor. This requires the use of HP-UX
  version 11.23 (11i v2) or 11.31 (11i v3), and with the exception of a few
  differences detailed below and in later sections, Perl should compile with no
  problems.
<p class="Pp">Although PA-RISC binaries can run on Itanium systems, you should
    not attempt to use a PA-RISC version of Perl on an Itanium system. This is
    because shared libraries created on an Itanium system cannot be loaded while
    running a PA-RISC executable.</p>

HP-UX supports dynamically loadable libraries (shared libraries). Shared
  libraries end with the suffix .sl. On Itanium systems, they end with the
  suffix .so.
<p class="Pp">Shared libraries created on a platform using a particular PA-RISC
    version are not usable on platforms using an earlier PA-RISC version by
    default. However, this backwards compatibility may be enabled using the same
    +DAportable compiler flag (with the same PA-RISC 1.0 caveat mentioned
    above).</p>
<p class="Pp">Shared libraries created on an Itanium platform cannot be loaded
    on a PA-RISC platform. Shared libraries created on a PA-RISC platform can
    only be loaded on an Itanium platform if it is a PA-RISC executable that is
    attempting to load the PA-RISC library. A PA-RISC shared library cannot be
    loaded into an Itanium executable nor vice-versa.</p>
<p class="Pp">To create a shared library, the following steps must be
  performed:</p>

     which contains Position-Independent Code (PIC).  The linker will
     tell you in the next step if +Z was needed.
     (For gcc, the appropriate flag is -fpic or -fPIC.)

  2. Link the shared library using the -b flag.  If the code calls
     any functions in other system libraries (e.g., libm), it must
     be included on this line.
</pre>
<p class="Pp">(Note that these steps are usually handled automatically by the
    extension's Makefile).</p>
<p class="Pp">If these dependent libraries are not listed at shared library
    creation time, you will get fatal &quot;Unresolved symbol&quot; errors at
    run time when the library is loaded.</p>
<p class="Pp">You may create a shared library that refers to another library,
    which may be either an archive library or a shared library. If this second
    library is a shared library, this is called a &quot;dependent library&quot;.
    The dependent library's name is recorded in the main shared library, but it
    is not linked into the shared library. Instead, it is loaded when the main
    shared library is loaded. This can cause problems if you build an extension
    on one system and move it to another system where the libraries may not be
    located in the same place as on the first system.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the referred library is an archive library, then it is treated
    as a simple collection of .o modules (all of which must contain PIC). These
    modules are then linked into the shared library.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that it is okay to create a library which contains a
    dependent library that is already linked into perl.</p>
<p class="Pp">Some extensions, like DB_File and Compress::Zlib use/require
    prebuilt libraries for the perl extensions/modules to work. If these
    libraries are built using the default configuration, it might happen that
    you run into an error like &quot;invalid loader fixup&quot; during load
    phase. HP is aware of this problem. Search the HP-UX cxx-dev forums for
    discussions about the subject. The short answer is that <b>everything</b>
    (all libraries, everything) must be compiled with
    <span class="Li">&quot;+z&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;+Z&quot;</span> to be PIC (position independent
    code). (For gcc, that would be <span class="Li">&quot;-fpic&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;-fPIC&quot;</span>). In HP-UX 11.00 or newer the
    linker error message should tell the name of the offending object file.</p>
<p class="Pp">A more general approach is to intervene manually, as with an
    example for the DB_File module, which requires SleepyCat's libdb.sl:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  # cd .../db-3.2.9/build_unix

  CXXFLAGS=       -c $(CPPFLAGS) +Z -Ae +O2 +Onolimit \
                  -I/usr/local/include -I/usr/include/X11R6

When using this compiler to build Perl, you should make sure that the flag -Aa

<h2 class="Ss" id="The__s-1GNU_C_s0_Compiler"><a class="permalink" href="#The__s-1GNU_C_s0_Compiler">The
  GNU C Compiler</a></h2>
When you are going to use the GNU C compiler (gcc), and you don't have gcc yet,
  you can either build it yourself (if you feel masochistic enough) from the
  sources (available from e.g. &lt;http://gcc.gnu.org/mirrors.html&gt;) or fetch
  a prebuilt binary from the HP porting center at
  &lt;http://hpux.connect.org.uk/hppd/cgi-bin/search?term=gcc&amp;Search=Search&gt;
  or from the DSPP (you need to be a member) at
  &lt;http://h21007.www2.hp.com/portal/site/dspp/menuitem.863c3e4cbcdc3f3515b49c108973a801?ciid=2a08725cc2f02110725cc2f02110275d6e10RCRD&amp;jumpid=reg_r1002_usen_c-001_title_r0001&gt;
  (Browse through the list, because there are often multiple versions of the
  same package available).
<p class="Pp">Most mentioned distributions are depots. H.Merijn Brand has made
    prebuilt gcc binaries available on
    &lt;http://mirrors.develooper.com/hpux/&gt; and/or
    &lt;http://www.cmve.net/~merijn/&gt; for HP-UX 10.20 (only 32bit), HP-UX
    11.00, HP-UX 11.11 (HP-UX 11i v1), and HP-UX 11.23 (HP-UX 11i v2 PA-RISC) in
    both 32- and 64-bit versions. For HP-UX 11.23 IPF and HP-UX 11.31 IPF depots
    are available too. The IPF versions do not need two versions of GNU gcc.</p>
<p class="Pp">On PA-RISC you need a different compiler for 32-bit applications
    and for 64-bit applications. On PA-RISC, 32-bit objects and 64-bit objects
    do not mix. Period. There is no different behaviour for HP C-ANSI-C or GNU
    gcc. So if you require your perl binary to use 64-bit libraries, like
    Oracle-64bit, you MUST build a 64-bit perl.</p>
<p class="Pp">Building a 64-bit capable gcc on PA-RISC from source is possible
    only when you have the HP C-ANSI C compiler or an already working 64-bit
    binary of gcc available. Best performance for perl is achieved with HP's
    native compiler.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Using_Large_Files_with_Perl_on_HP-UX"><a class="permalink" href="#Using_Large_Files_with_Perl_on_HP-UX">Using
  Large Files with Perl on HP-UX</a></h2>
Beginning with HP-UX version 10.20, files larger than 2GB (2^31 bytes) may be
  created and manipulated. Three separate methods of doing this are available.
  Of these methods, the best method for Perl is to compile using the
  -Duselargefiles flag to Configure. This causes Perl to be compiled using
  structures and functions in which these are 64 bits wide, rather than 32 bits
  wide. (Note that this will only work with HP's ANSI C compiler. If you want to
  compile Perl using gcc, you will have to get a version of the compiler that
  supports 64-bit operations. See above for where to find it.)
<p class="Pp">There are some drawbacks to this approach. One is that any
    extension which calls any file-manipulating C function will need to be
    recompiled (just follow the usual &quot;perl Makefile.PL; make; make test;
    make install&quot; procedure).</p>
<p class="Pp">The list of functions that will need to recompiled is:
   creat, fgetpos, fopen,
   freopen, fsetpos, fstat,
   fstatvfs, fstatvfsdev, ftruncate,
   ftw, lockf, lseek,
   lstat, mmap, nftw,
   open, prealloc, stat,
   statvfs, statvfsdev, tmpfile,
   truncate, getrlimit, setrlimit</p>
<p class="Pp">Another drawback is only valid for Perl versions before 5.6.0.
    This drawback is that the seek and tell functions (both the builtin version
    and POSIX module version) will not perform correctly.</p>
<p class="Pp">It is strongly recommended that you use this flag when you run
    Configure. If you do not do this, but later answer the question about large
    files when Configure asks you, you may get a configuration that cannot be
    compiled, or that does not function as expected.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Threaded_Perl_on_HP-UX"><a class="permalink" href="#Threaded_Perl_on_HP-UX">Threaded

It is possible to compile a version of threaded Perl on any version of HP-UX
  before 10.30, but it is strongly suggested that you be running on HP-UX 11.00
  at least.
<p class="Pp">To compile Perl with threads, add -Dusethreads to the arguments of
    Configure. Verify that the -D_POSIX_C_SOURCE=199506L compiler flag is
    automatically added to the list of flags. Also make sure that -lpthread is
    listed before -lc in the list of libraries to link Perl with. The hints
    provided for HP-UX during Configure will try very hard to get this right for
    you.</p>
<p class="Pp">HP-UX versions before 10.30 require a separate installation of a
    POSIX threads library package. Two examples are the HP DCE package,
    available on &quot;HP-UX Hardware Extensions 3.0, Install and Core OS,
    Release 10.20, April 1999 (B3920-13941)&quot; or the Freely available PTH
    package, available on H.Merijn's site
    (&lt;http://mirrors.develooper.com/hpux/&gt;). The use of PTH will be
    unsupported in perl-5.12 and up and is rather buggy in 5.11.x.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you are going to use the HP DCE package, the library used for
    threading is /usr/lib/libcma.sl, but there have been multiple updates of
    that library over time. Perl will build with the first version, but it will
    not pass the test suite. Older Oracle versions might be a compelling reason
    not to update that library, otherwise please find a newer version in one of
    the following patches: PHSS_19739, PHSS_20608, or PHSS_23672</p>

  Perl on HP-UX</a></h2>
Beginning with HP-UX 11.00, programs compiled under HP-UX can take advantage of
  the LP64 programming environment (LP64 means Longs and Pointers are 64 bits
  wide), in which scalar variables will be able to hold numbers larger than 2^32
  with complete precision. Perl has proven to be consistent and reliable in
  64bit mode since 5.8.1 on all HP-UX 11.xx.
<p class="Pp">As of the date of this document, Perl is fully 64-bit compliant on
    HP-UX 11.00 and up for both cc- and gcc builds. If you are about to build a
    64-bit perl with GNU gcc, please read the gcc section carefully.</p>
<p class="Pp">Should a user have the need for compiling Perl in the LP64
    environment, use the -Duse64bitall flag to Configure. This will force Perl
    to be compiled in a pure LP64 environment (with the +DD64 flag for HP
    C-ANSI-C, with no additional options for GNU gcc 64-bit on PA-RISC, and with
    -mlp64 for GNU gcc on Itanium). If you want to compile Perl using gcc, you
    will have to get a version of the compiler that supports 64-bit
  operations.)</p>
<p class="Pp">You can also use the -Duse64bitint flag to Configure. Although
    there are some minor differences between compiling Perl with this flag
    versus the -Duse64bitall flag, they should not be noticeable from a Perl
    user's perspective. When configuring -Duse64bitint using a 64bit gcc on a
    pa-risc architecture, -Duse64bitint is silently promoted to
  -Duse64bitall.</p>
<p class="Pp">In both cases, it is strongly recommended that you use these flags
    when you run Configure. If you do not use do this, but later answer the
    questions about 64-bit numbers when Configure asks you, you may get a
    configuration that cannot be compiled, or that does not function as
