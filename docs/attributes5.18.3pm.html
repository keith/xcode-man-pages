<p class="Pp">Subroutine declarations and definitions may optionally have
    attribute lists associated with them. (Variable
    <span class="Li">&quot;my&quot;</span> declarations also may, but see the
    warning below.) Perl handles these declarations by passing some information
    about the call site and the thing being declared along with the attribute
    list to this module. In particular, the first example above is equivalent to
    the following:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    use attributes __PACKAGE__, \&amp;foo, 'method';
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The second example in the synopsis does something equivalent to
    this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    use attributes ();
    my ($x,@y,%z);
    attributes::-&gt;import(__PACKAGE__, \$x, 'Bent');
    attributes::-&gt;import(__PACKAGE__, \@y, 'Bent');
    attributes::-&gt;import(__PACKAGE__, \%z, 'Bent');
    ($x,@y,%z) = 1;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Yes, that's a lot of expansion.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>WARNING</b>: attribute declarations for variables are still
    evolving. The semantics and interfaces of such declarations could change in
    future versions. They are present for purposes of experimentation with what
    the semantics ought to be. Do not rely on the current implementation of this
    feature.</p>
<p class="Pp">There are only a few attributes currently handled by Perl itself
    (or directly by this module, depending on how you look at it.) However,
    package-specific attributes are allowed by an extension mechanism. (See
    &quot;Package-specific Attribute Handling&quot; below.)</p>
<p class="Pp">The setting of subroutine attributes happens at compile time.
    Variable attributes in <span class="Li">&quot;our&quot;</span> declarations
    are also applied at compile time. However,
    <span class="Li">&quot;my&quot;</span> variables get their attributes
    applied at run-time. This means that you have to <i>reach</i> the run-time
    component of the <span class="Li">&quot;my&quot;</span> before those
    attributes will get applied. For example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    my $x : Bent = 42 if 0;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">will neither assign 42 to <span class="Li">$x</span> <i>nor</i>
    will it apply the <span class="Li">&quot;Bent&quot;</span> attribute to the
    variable.</p>
<p class="Pp">An attempt to set an unrecognized attribute is a fatal error. (The
    error is trappable, but it still stops the compilation within that
    <span class="Li">&quot;eval&quot;</span>.) Setting an attribute with a name
    that's all lowercase letters that's not a built-in attribute (such as
    &quot;foo&quot;) will result in a warning with <b>-w</b> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;use warnings 'reserved'&quot;</span>.</p>

<p class="Pp">In the description it is mentioned that</p>

<pre>  sub foo : method;

<p class="Pp">is equivalent to</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  use attributes __PACKAGE__, \&amp;foo, 'method';

<p class="Pp">As you might know this calls the
    <span class="Li">&quot;import&quot;</span> function of

<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  attributes-&gt;import( __PACKAGE__, \&amp;foo, 'method' );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">So you want to know what
    <span class="Li">&quot;import&quot;</span> actually does?</p>
<p class="Pp">First of all <span class="Li">&quot;import&quot;</span> gets the
    type of the third parameter ('CODE' in this case).
    <span class="Li">&quot;attributes.pm&quot;</span> checks if there is a
    subroutine called
    <span class="Li">&quot;MODIFY_&lt;reftype&gt;_ATTRIBUTES&quot;</span> in the
    caller's namespace (here: 'main'). In this case a subroutine
    <span class="Li">&quot;MODIFY_CODE_ATTRIBUTES&quot;</span> is required. Then
    this method is called to check if you have used a &quot;bad attribute&quot;.
    The subroutine call in this example would look like</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  MODIFY_CODE_ATTRIBUTES( 'main', \&amp;foo, 'method' );
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;MODIFY_&lt;reftype&gt;_ATTRIBUTES&quot;</span>
    has to return a list of all &quot;bad attributes&quot;. If there are any bad

<p class="Pp">The following are the built-in attributes for subroutines:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="lvalue"><a class="permalink" href="#lvalue">lvalue</a></dt>
  <dd>Indicates that the referenced subroutine is a valid lvalue and can be
      assigned to. The subroutine must return a modifiable value such as a
      scalar variable, as described in perlsub.
    <p class="Pp">This module allows one to set this attribute on a subroutine
        that is already defined. For Perl subroutines (XSUBs are fine), it may
        or may not do what you want, depending on the code inside the
        subroutine, with details subject to change in future Perl versions. You
        may run into problems with lvalue context not being propagated properly
        into the subroutine, or maybe even assertion failures. For this reason,
        a warning is emitted if warnings are enabled. In other words, you should
        only do this if you really know what you are doing. You have been
        warned.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="method"><a class="permalink" href="#method">method</a></dt>
  <dd>Indicates that the referenced subroutine is a method. A subroutine so
      marked will not trigger the &quot;Ambiguous call resolved as
      CORE::%s&quot; warning.</dd>
  <dt id="locked"><a class="permalink" href="#locked">locked</a></dt>
  <dd>The &quot;locked&quot; attribute is deprecated, and has no effect in
      5.10.0 and later. It was used as part of the now-removed &quot;Perl 5.005
      threads&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The following are the built-in attributes for variables:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="shared"><a class="permalink" href="#shared">shared</a></dt>
  <dd>Indicates that the referenced variable can be shared across different
      threads when used in conjunction with the threads and threads::shared
      modules.</dd>
  <dt id="unique"><a class="permalink" href="#unique">unique</a></dt>
  <dd>The &quot;unique&quot; attribute is deprecated, and has no effect in

    module has been loaded:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="get"><a class="permalink" href="#get">get</a></dt>
  <dd>This routine expects a single parameter--a reference to a subroutine or
      variable. It returns a list of attributes, which may be empty. If passed
      invalid arguments, it uses <i>die()</i> (via Carp::croak) to raise a fatal
      exception. If it can find an appropriate package name for a class method
      lookup, it will include the results from a
      <span class="Li">&quot;FETCH_</span><span class="Li"><i>type</i></span><span class="Li">_ATTRIBUTES&quot;</span>
      call in its return list, as described in &quot;Package-specific Attribute
      Handling&quot; below. Otherwise, only built-in attributes will be
      returned.</dd>
  <dt id="reftype"><a class="permalink" href="#reftype">reftype</a></dt>
  <dd>This routine expects a single parameter--a reference to a subroutine or
      variable. It returns the built-in type of the referenced variable,
      ignoring any package into which it might have been blessed. This can be
      useful for determining the <i>type</i> value which forms part of the
      method names described in &quot;Package-specific Attribute Handling&quot;
      below.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Note that these routines are <i>not</i> exported by default.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Package-specific_Attribute_Handling"><a class="permalink" href="#Package-specific_Attribute_Handling">Package-specific
  Attribute Handling</a></h2>
<p class="Pp"><b>WARNING</b>: the mechanisms described here are still
    experimental. Do not rely on the current implementation. In particular,
    there is no provision for applying package attributes to 'cloned' copies of
    subroutines used as closures. (See &quot;Making References&quot; in perlref
    for information on closures.) Package-specific attribute handling may change
    incompatibly in a future release.</p>
<p class="Pp">When an attribute list is present in a declaration, a check is
    made to see whether an attribute 'modify' handler is present in the
    appropriate package (or its <span class="Li">@ISA</span> inheritance tree).
    Similarly, when <span class="Li">&quot;attributes::get&quot;</span> is
    called on a valid reference, a check is made for an appropriate attribute
    'fetch' handler. See &quot;EXAMPLES&quot; to see how the &quot;appropriate
    package&quot; determination works.</p>
<p class="Pp">The handler names are based on the underlying type of the variable
    being declared or of the reference passed. Because these attributes are
    associated with subroutine or variable declarations, this deliberately
    ignores any possibility of being blessed into some package. Thus, a
    subroutine declaration uses &quot;CODE&quot; as its <i>type</i>, and even a
    blessed hash reference uses &quot;HASH&quot; as its <i>type</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The class methods invoked for modifying and fetching are
  these:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="FETCH_"><a class="permalink" href="#FETCH_">FETCH_<i>type</i>_ATTRIBUTES</a></dt>
  <dd>This method is called with two arguments: the relevant package name, and a
      reference to a variable or subroutine for which package-defined attributes
      are desired. The expected return value is a list of associated attributes.
      This list may be empty.</dd>
  <dt id="MODIFY_"><a class="permalink" href="#MODIFY_">MODIFY_<i>type</i>_ATTRIBUTES</a></dt>
  <dd>This method is called with two fixed arguments, followed by the list of
      attributes from the relevant declaration. The two fixed arguments are the
      relevant package name and a reference to the declared subroutine or
      variable. The expected return value is a list of attributes which were not
      recognized by this handler. Note that this allows for a derived class to
      delegate a call to its base class, and then only examine the attributes
      which the base class didn't already handle for it.
    <p class="Pp">The call to this method is currently made <i>during</i> the
        processing of the declaration. In particular, this means that a
        subroutine reference will probably be for an undefined subroutine, even
        if this declaration is actually part of the definition.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Calling <span class="Li">&quot;attributes::get()&quot;</span> from
    within the scope of a null package declaration
    <span class="Li">&quot;package ;&quot;</span> for an unblessed variable
    reference will not provide any starting package name for the 'fetch' method
    lookup. Thus, this circumstance will not result in a method call for
    package-defined attributes. A named subroutine knows to which symbol table
    entry it belongs (or originally belonged), and it will use the corresponding
    package. An anonymous subroutine knows the package name into which it was
    compiled (unless it was also compiled with a null package declaration), and
    so it will use that package name.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Syntax_of_Attribute_Lists"><a class="permalink" href="#Syntax_of_Attribute_Lists">Syntax
  of Attribute Lists</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">An attribute list is a sequence of attribute specifications,
    separated by whitespace or a colon (with optional whitespace). Each
    attribute specification is a simple name, optionally followed by a
    parenthesised parameter list. If such a parameter list is present, it is
    scanned past as for the rules for the
    <span class="Li">&quot;q()&quot;</span> operator. (See &quot;Quote and
    Quote-like Operators&quot; in perlop.) The parameter list is passed as it
    was found, however, and not as per
  <span class="Li">&quot;q()&quot;</span>.</p>
