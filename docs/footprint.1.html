<h1 class="Sh" id="INVESTIGATING_MEMORY_FOOTPRINT"><a class="permalink" href="#INVESTIGATING_MEMORY_FOOTPRINT">INVESTIGATING
  MEMORY FOOTPRINT</a></h1>
<p class="Pp"><code class="Nm">footprint</code> provides an efficient
    calculation of a process's memory footprint and a high-level overview of the
    various categories of memory contributing to that footprint. The details
    that it provides can be used as a starting point in an investigation.</p>
<p class="Pp">Prioritize reducing &quot;Dirty&quot; memory. Dirty memory cannot
    be automatically reclaimed by the kernel and is directly used by various
    parts of the OS as a measure of a process's contribution to system memory
    pressure.
  <br/>
  Next, focus on reducing &quot;Reclaimable&quot; memory, especially purgeable
    volatile memory which will become dirty when marked non-volatile. Although
    this memory can be cheaply reclaimed by the kernel, purgeable volatile
    memory is commonly used as a cache of data that may be expensive for a user
    process to recreate (such as decoded image data).
  <br/>
  &quot;Clean&quot; memory can also be cheaply taken by the kernel, but unlike
    &quot;Reclaimable&quot; it can be restored automatically by the kernel
    without the help of a user process. For example, clean file backed data can
    be automatically evicted from memory and re-read from disk on-demand. Having
    too much clean memory can still be a performance problem, since large
    working sets can cause thrashing when loading and unloading various parts of
    a process under low memory situations.
  <br/>
  Lastly, avoid using &quot;Wired&quot; memory as much as possible since it
    cannot be paged out or reclaimed.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>Malloc memory</dt>
  <dd>Memory allocated by <a class="Xr">malloc(3)</a> is one of the most common
      forms of memory, making up what is usually referred to as the 'heap'. This
      memory will have a category prefixed with 'MALLOC_'.
      <a class="Xr">malloc(3)</a> allocates VM regions on a process's behalf;
      the contents of those regions will be the individual allocations
      representing objects and data in a process. Refer to the
      <a class="Xr">heap(1)</a> tool to further categorize the objects contained
      within a malloc memory region, or <a class="Xr">leaks(1)</a> to detect a
      subset of heap memory that is no longer reachable.</dd>
  <dt>Binary segments</dt>
  <dd>Loaded binaries will be visible as an entry with both the segment type and
      the path to the binary, most often __TEXT, __DATA, or __LINKEDIT segments.
      Non-shared cache binaries and pages in the __DATA segment (such as those
      that contain modified global variables) can often have dirty memory.</dd>
  <dt>Mapped files</dt>
  <dd>File-backed memory allocated using <a class="Xr">mmap(2)</a> will show up
      as 'mapped file' along with the path to the file.</dd>
  <dt>VM allocations</dt>
  <dd>Most other types of memory can be tagged with a name that indicates what
      subsystem allocated the region (see <a class="Xr">mmap(2)</a> for more
      information). For instance, Foundation.framework may allocate memory and
      tag it with VM_MEMORY_FOUNDATION, which appears in
      <code class="Nm">footprint</code>'s output as 'Foundation'. Processes are
      able to allocate memory with their own tags by using an appropriate tag in
      the range
      VM_MEMORY_APPLICATION_SPECIFIC_1-VM_MEMORY_APPLICATION_SPECIFIC_16. Memory
      which does not fall into one of the previous categories and has not been
      explicitly tagged will be marked 'untagged (VM_ALLOCATE)'.</dd>
  <dt>Kernel memory</dt>
  <dd>In the special case of analyzing kernel_task,
      <code class="Nm">footprint</code>'s output and categories will mirror much
      of the data also available via <a class="Xr">zprint(1)</a>. This is memory
      allocated by the kernel or a kernel extension and is generally unavailable
      to userspace directly. Despite the restricted access, userspace programs
      often influence when and how much memory the kernel allocates (e.g., for
      resources allocated on behalf of a user process).</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">For malloc and VM allocated memory, details about when and where
    the memory was allocated can often be obtained by enabling
    MallocStackLogging and using <a class="Xr">malloc_history(1)</a> to view the
    backtrace at the time of each allocation. Xcode.app and Instruments.app also
    provide visual tools for debugging memory, such as the Xcode's Memory Graph
    Debugger.</p>
<p class="Pp"><a class="Xr">vmmap(1)</a> provides a similar view to
    <code class="Nm">footprint</code>, but with an emphasis on displaying the
    raw metrics returned by the kernel rather than the simplified and more
    processed view of <code class="Nm">footprint</code>. One important
    difference is that <a class="Xr">vmmap(1)</a>'s &quot;DIRTY&quot; column
    does not include the compressed or swapped memory found in the
    &quot;SWAPPED&quot; column. Additionally, <a class="Xr">vmmap(1)</a> can
    only operate on a single process and contains additional information such as
    a malloc zone summary.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="MEMORY_ACCOUNTING"><a class="permalink" href="#MEMORY_ACCOUNTING">MEMORY
  ACCOUNTING</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Determining what dirty memory should and should not be accounted
    to a process is a difficult problem. Memory can be shared by many processes,
    it can sometimes be allocated on your behalf by other processes, and no
    matter how the accounting is done can often be expensive to accurately
    calculate.</p>
<p class="Pp">Many operating systems have historically exposed memory metrics
    such as Virtual Size (VSIZE) and Resident Size (RSIZE/RPRVT/RSS/etc.).
    Metrics such as these, which are useful in their own respect, are not great
    indicators of the amount of physical memory required by a process to run
    (and therefore the memory pressure that a process applies to the system).
    For instance, Virtual Size includes allocations that may not be backed by
    physical memory, and Resident Size includes clean and volatile purgeable
    memory that can be reclaimed by the kernel (as described earlier).
  <br/>
  On the other hand, analyzing the dirty memory reported by the underlying VM
    objects mapped into a process (the approach taken by
    <code class="Fl">--vmObjectDirty</code>), while more accurate, is expensive
    and cannot be done in real-time for systems that need to frequently know the
    memory footprint of a process.</p>
<p class="Pp">Apple platforms instead keep track of the 'physical footprint' by
    using a per-process ledger in the kernel that is kept up-to-date by the pmap
    and other subsystems. This ledger is cheap to query, suitably accurate, and
    provides additional features such as tracking peak memory and the ability to
    charge one process for memory that is no longer mapped into it or that may
    have been allocated by another process. In cases where
    <code class="Nm">footprint</code> is unable to analyze a portion of
    'physical footprint' that is not mapped into a process, this memory will be
    listed as 'Owned physical footprint (unmapped)'. If this memory is mapped
    into another userspace process then the <code class="Fl">--unmapped</code>
    argument can be used to search all processes for a mapping of the same VM
    object, which if found will provide a better description and what process(s)
    have mapped the memory. This also happens by default when targeting all
    processes via <code class="Fl">--all</code>. Any memory still listed as
    &quot;(unmapped)&quot; after using <code class="Fl">--unmapped</code> is
    likely not mapped into any userspace process and instead only referenced by
    the kernel or drivers.
  <br/>
  The exact definition of this 'physical footprint' ledger is complicated and
    subject to change, but suffice it to say that the default mode of
    <code class="Nm">footprint</code> aims to present an accurate memory
    breakdown that matches the value reported by the ledger. Most other
    diagnostic tools, such as the 'MEM' column in <a class="Xr">top(1)</a>, the
    'Memory' column in Activity Monitor.app, and the Memory Debug Gauge in
    Xcode.app, query this ledger to populate their metrics.</p>
<p class="Pp">Physical footprint can be potentially be split into multiple
    subcategories, such as network related memory, graphics, etc. When a memory
    allocation (either directly mapped into a process, or owned but unmapped)
    has such a classification, footprint will append it to the category name
    such as 'IOKit (graphics)' or 'Owned physical footprint (unmapped)
  (media)'.</p>
