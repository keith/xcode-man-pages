   Set up some character translations and predefined strings.  \*(-- will
   give an unbreakable dash, \*(PI will give pi, \*(L" will give a left
   double quote, and \*(R" will give a right double quote.  \*(C+ will
   give a nicer C++.  Capital omega is used to do unbreakable dashes and
   therefore won't be available.  \*(C` and \*(C' expand to `' in nroff,
   nothing in troff, for use with C<>.

  Character Database 4.1.0</a></h2>
The copy of the Unicode Character Database included in Perl 5.8 has been updated
  to 4.1.0 from 4.0.1. See
  &lt;http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode4.1.0/#NotableChanges&gt; for the
  notable changes.

<h2 class="Ss" id="suidperl_less_insecure"><a class="permalink" href="#suidperl_less_insecure">suidperl
  less insecure</a></h2>
A pair of exploits in <span class="Li">&quot;suidperl&quot;</span> involving
  debugging code have been closed.
<p class="Pp">For new projects the core perl team strongly recommends that you
    use dedicated, single purpose security tools such as
    <span class="Li">&quot;sudo&quot;</span> in preference to
    <span class="Li">&quot;suidperl&quot;</span>.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Optional_site_customization_script"><a class="permalink" href="#Optional_site_customization_script">Optional
  site customization script</a></h2>
The perl interpreter can be built to allow the use of a site customization
  script. By default this is not enabled, to be consistent with previous perl
  releases. To use this, add
  <span class="Li">&quot;-Dusesitecustomize&quot;</span> to the command line
  flags when running the <span class="Li">&quot;Configure&quot;</span> script.
  See also &quot;-f&quot; in perlrun.

<h2 class="Ss" id="_Config.pm__is_now_much_smaller."><a class="permalink" href="#_Config.pm__is_now_much_smaller.">&quot;Config.pm&quot;
  is now much smaller.</a></h2>
<span class="Li">&quot;Config.pm&quot;</span> is now about 3K rather than 32K,
  with the infrequently used code and <span class="Li">%Config</span> values
  loaded on demand. This is transparent to the programmer, but means that most
  code will save parsing and loading 29K of script (for example, code that uses
  <span class="Li">&quot;File::Find&quot;</span>).

  Bug Fixes</a></h1>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>The <b>socket()</b> function on Win32 has been fixed so that it is able to
      use transport providers which specify a protocol of 0 (meaning any
      protocol is allowed) once more. (This was broken in 5.8.6, and typically
      caused the use of ICMP sockets to fail.)</li>
  <li>Another obscure bug involving <span class="Li">&quot;substr&quot;</span>
      and UTF-8 caused by bad internal offset caching has been identified and
      fixed.</li>
  <li>A bug involving the loading of UTF-8 tables by the regexp engine has been
      fixed - code such as <span class="Li">&quot;&quot;\x{100}&quot; =~
      /[[:print:]]/&quot;</span> will no longer give corrupt results.</li>
  <li>Case conversion operations such as <span class="Li">&quot;uc&quot;</span>
      on a long Unicode string could exhaust memory. This has been fixed.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;index&quot;</span>/<span class="Li">&quot;rindex&quot;</span>
      were buggy for some combinations of Unicode and non-Unicode data. This has
      been fixed.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;read&quot;</span> (and presumably
      <span class="Li">&quot;sysread&quot;</span>) would expose the UTF-8
      internals when reading from a byte oriented file handle into a UTF-8
      scalar. This has been fixed.</li>
  <li>Several
      <span class="Li">&quot;pack&quot;</span>/<span class="Li">&quot;unpack&quot;</span>
      bug fixes:</li>
</ul>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Checksums with <span class="Li">&quot;b&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;B&quot;</span> formats were broken.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;unpack&quot;</span> checksums could overflow with
      the <span class="Li">&quot;C&quot;</span> format.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;U0&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;C0&quot;</span> are now scoped to
      <span class="Li">&quot;()&quot;</span>
      <span class="Li">&quot;pack&quot;</span> sub-templates.</li>
  <li>Counted length prefixes now don't change
      <span class="Li">&quot;C0&quot;</span>/<span class="Li">&quot;U0&quot;</span>
      mode.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;pack&quot;</span>
      <span class="Li">&quot;Z0&quot;</span> used to destroy the preceding
      character.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;P&quot;</span>/<span class="Li">&quot;p&quot;</span>
      <span class="Li">&quot;pack&quot;</span> formats used to only recognise
      literal <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="Bd-indent"></div>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Using closures with ithreads could cause perl to crash. This was due to
      failure to correctly lock internal OP structures, and has been fixed.</li>
  <li>The return value of <span class="Li">&quot;close&quot;</span> now
      correctly reflects any file errors that occur while flushing the handle's
      data, instead of just giving failure if the actual underlying file close
      operation failed.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;not() || 1&quot;</span> used to segfault.
      <span class="Li">&quot;not()&quot;</span> now behaves like
      <span class="Li">not(0)</span>, which was the pre 5.6.0 behaviour.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;h2ph&quot;</span> has various enhancements to cope
      with constructs in header files that used to result in incorrect or
      invalid output.</li>

There is a new taint error, &quot;%ENV is aliased to
  <span class="Li">%s</span>&quot;. This error is thrown when taint checks are
  enabled and when <span class="Li">*ENV</span> has been aliased, so that
  <span class="Li">%ENV</span> has no env-magic anymore and hence the
  environment cannot be verified as taint-free.
<p class="Pp">The internals of <span class="Li">&quot;pack&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;unpack&quot;</span> have been updated. All legitimate
    templates should work as before, but there may be some changes in the error
    reported for complex failure cases. Any behaviour changes for non-error
    cases are bugs, and should be reported.</p>

There has been a fair amount of refactoring of the
  <span class="Li">&quot;C&quot;</span> source code, partly to make it tidier
  and more maintainable. The resulting object code and the
  <span class="Li">&quot;perl&quot;</span> binary may well be smaller than
  5.8.6, and hopefully faster in some cases, but apart from this there should be
  no user-detectable changes.
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;${^UTF8LOCALE}&quot;</span> has been added
    to give perl space access to
    <span class="Li">&quot;PL_utf8locale&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The size of the arenas used to allocate SV heads and most SV
    bodies can now be changed at compile time. The old size was 1008 bytes, the
    new default size is 4080 bytes.</p>

On UNICOS, lib/Math/BigInt/t/bigintc.t hangs burning CPU. ext/B/t/bytecode.t and
  ext/Socket/t/socketpair.t both fail tests. These are unlikely to be resolved,

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
  posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
  http://bugs.perl.org. There may also be information at http://www.perl.org,
  the Perl Home Page.
<p class="Pp">If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the
    <b>perlbug</b> program included with your release. Be sure to trim your bug
    down to a tiny but sufficient test case. Your bug report, along with the
    output of <span class="Li">&quot;perl -V&quot;</span>, will be sent off to
