   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

In its simplest usage, the <b>return</b> command is used without options in the
  body of a procedure to immediately return control to the caller of the
  procedure. If a <i>result</i> argument is provided, its value becomes the
  result of the procedure passed back to the caller. If <i>result</i> is not
  specified then an empty string will be returned to the caller as the result of
  the procedure.
<p class="Pp">The <b>return</b> command serves a similar function within script
    files that are evaluated by the <b>source</b> command. When <b>source</b>
    evaluates the contents of a file as a script, an invocation of the
    <b>return</b> command will cause script evaluation to immediately cease, and
    the value <i>result</i> (or an empty string) will be returned as the result
    of the <b>source</b> command.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="EXCEPTIONAL_RETURN_CODES"><a class="permalink" href="#EXCEPTIONAL_RETURN_CODES">EXCEPTIONAL
  RETURN CODES</a></h1>
In addition to the result of a procedure, the return code of a procedure may
  also be set by <b>return</b> through use of the <b>-code</b> option. In the
  usual case where the <b>-code</b> option is not specified the procedure will
  return normally. However, the <b>-code</b> option may be used to generate an
  exceptional return from the procedure. <i>Code</i> may have any of the
  following values:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>ok (or 0)</b></dt>
  <dd>Normal return: same as if the option is omitted. The return code of the
      procedure is 0 (<b>TCL_OK</b>).</dd>
  <dt><b>error (1)</b></dt>
  <dd>Error return: the return code of the procedure is 1 (<b>TCL_ERROR</b>).
      The procedure command behaves in its calling context as if it were the
      command <b>error </b><i>result</i>. See below for additional options.</dd>
  <dt><b>return (2)</b></dt>
  <dd>The return code of the procedure is 2 (<b>TCL_RETURN</b>). The procedure
      command behaves in its calling context as if it were the command
      <b>return</b> (with no arguments).</dd>
  <dt><b>break (3)</b></dt>
  <dd>The return code of the procedure is 3 (<b>TCL_BREAK</b>). The procedure
      command behaves in its calling context as if it were the command
      <b>break</b>.</dd>
  <dt><b>continue (4)</b></dt>
  <dd>The return code of the procedure is 4 (<b>TCL_CONTINUE</b>). The procedure
      command behaves in its calling context as if it were the command
      <b>continue</b>.</dd>
  <dt><i>value</i></dt>
  <dd><i>Value</i> must be an integer; it will be returned as the return code
      for the current procedure.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">When a procedure wants to signal that it has received invalid
    arguments from its caller, it may use <b>return -code error</b> with
    <i>result</i> set to a suitable error message. Otherwise usage of the
    <b>return -code</b> option is mostly limited to procedures that implement a
    new control structure.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>return -code</b> command acts similarly within script files
    that are evaluated by the <b>source</b> command. During the evaluation of
    the contents of a file as a script by <b>source</b>, an invocation of the
    <b>return -code </b><i>code</i> command will cause the return code of
    <b>source</b> to be <i>code</i>.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="RETURN_OPTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#RETURN_OPTIONS">RETURN
  OPTIONS</a></h1>
In addition to a result and a return code, evaluation of a command in Tcl also
  produces a dictionary of return options. In general usage, all <i>option
  value</i> pairs given as arguments to <b>return</b> become entries in the
  return options dictionary, and any values at all are acceptable except as
  noted below. The <b>catch</b> command may be used to capture all of this
  information &#x2014; the return code, the result, and the return options
  dictionary &#x2014; that arise from evaluation of a script.
<p class="Pp">As documented above, the <b>-code</b> entry in the return options
    dictionary receives special treatment by Tcl. There are other return options
    also recognized and treated specially by Tcl. They are:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>-errorcode </b><i>list</i></dt>
  <dd>The <b>-errorcode</b> option receives special treatment only when the
      value of the <b>-code</b> option is <b>TCL_ERROR</b>. Then the <i>list</i>
      value is meant to be additional information about the error, presented as
      a Tcl list for further processing by programs. If no <b>-errorcode</b>
      option is provided to <b>return</b> when the <b>-code error</b> option is
      provided, Tcl will set the value of the <b>-errorcode</b> entry in the
      return options dictionary to the default value of <b>NONE</b>. The
      <b>-errorcode</b> return option will also be stored in the global variable
      <b>errorCode</b>.</dd>
  <dt><b>-errorinfo </b><i>info</i></dt>
  <dd>The <b>-errorinfo</b> option receives special treatment only when the
      value of the <b>-code</b> option is <b>TCL_ERROR</b>. Then <i>info</i> is
      the initial stack trace, meant to provide to a human reader additional
      information about the context in which the error occurred. The stack trace
      will also be stored in the global variable <b>errorInfo</b>. If no
      <b>-errorinfo</b> option is provided to <b>return</b> when the <b>-code
      error</b> option is provided, Tcl will provide its own initial stack trace
      value in the entry for <b>-errorinfo</b>. Tcl's initial stack trace will
      include only the call to the procedure, and stack unwinding will append
      information about higher stack levels, but there will be no information
      about the context of the error within the procedure. Typically the
      <i>info</i> value is supplied from the value of <b>-errorinfo</b> in a
      return options dictionary captured by the <b>catch</b> command (or from
      the copy of that information stored in the global variable
      <b>errorInfo</b>).</dd>
  <dt><b>-level </b><i>level</i></dt>
  <dd>The <b>-level</b> and <b>-code</b> options work together to set the return
      code to be returned by one of the commands currently being evaluated. The
      <i>level</i> value must be a non-negative integer representing a number of
      levels on the call stack. It defines the number of levels up the stack at
      which the return code of a command currently being evaluated should be
      <i>code</i>. If no <b>-level</b> option is provided, the default value of
      <i>level</i> is 1, so that <b>return</b> sets the return code that the
      current procedure returns to its caller, 1 level up the call stack. The
      mechanism by which these options work is described in more detail
    below.</dd>
  <dt><b>-options </b><i>options</i></dt>
  <dd>The value <i>options</i> must be a valid dictionary. The entries of that
      dictionary are treated as additional <i>option value</i> pairs for the
      <b>return</b> command.</dd>

<h1 class="Sh" id="RETURN_CODE_HANDLING_MECHANISMS"><a class="permalink" href="#RETURN_CODE_HANDLING_MECHANISMS">RETURN
  CODE HANDLING MECHANISMS</a></h1>
Return codes are used in Tcl to control program flow. A Tcl script is a sequence
  of Tcl commands. So long as each command evaluation returns a return code of
  <b>TCL_OK</b>, evaluation will continue to the next command in the script. Any
  exceptional return code (non-<b>TCL_OK</b>) returned by a command evaluation
  causes the flow on to the next command to be interrupted. Script evaluation
  ceases, and the exceptional return code from the command becomes the return
  code of the full script evaluation. This is the mechanism by which errors
  during script evaluation cause an interruption and unwinding of the call
  stack. It is also the mechanism by which commands like <b>break</b>,
  <b>continue</b>, and <b>return</b> cause script evaluation to terminate
  without evaluating all commands in sequence.
<p class="Pp">Some of Tcl's built-in commands evaluate scripts as part of their
    functioning. These commands can make use of exceptional return codes to
    enable special features. For example, the built-in Tcl commands that provide
    loops &#x2014; such as <b>while</b>, <b>for</b>, and <b>foreach</b> &#x2014;
    evaluate a script that is the body of the loop. If evaluation of the loop
    body returns the return code of <b>TCL_BREAK</b> or <b>TCL_CONTINUE</b>, the
    loop command can react in such a way as to give the <b>break</b> and
    <b>continue</b> commands their documented interpretation in loops.</p>
<p class="Pp">Procedure invocation also involves evaluation of a script, the
    body of the procedure. Procedure invocation provides special treatment when
    evaluation of the procedure body returns the return code <b>TCL_RETURN</b>.
    In that circumstance, the <b>-level</b> entry in the return options
    dictionary is decremented. If after decrementing, the value of the
    <b>-level</b> entry is 0, then the value of the <b>-code</b> entry becomes
    the return code of the procedure. If after decrementing, the value of the
    <b>-level</b> entry is greater than zero, then the return code of the
    procedure is <b>TCL_RETURN</b>. If the procedure invocation occurred during
    the evaluation of the body of another procedure, the process will repeat
    itself up the call stack, decrementing the value of the <b>-level</b> entry
    at each level, so that the <i>code</i> will be the return code of the
    current command <i>level</i> levels up the call stack. The <b>source</b>
    command performs the same handling of the <b>TCL_RETURN</b> return code,
    which explains the similarity of <b>return</b> invocation during a
    <b>source</b> to <b>return</b> invocation within a procedure.</p>
<p class="Pp">The return code of the <b>return</b> command itself triggers this
    special handling by procedure invocation. If <b>return</b> is provided the
    option <b>-level 0</b>, then the return code of the <b>return</b> command
    itself will be the value <i>code</i> of the <b>-code</b> option (or
    <b>TCL_OK</b> by default). Any other value for the <b>-level</b> option
    (including the default value of 1) will cause the return code of the
    <b>return</b> command itself to be <b>TCL_RETURN</b>, triggering a return
    from the enclosing procedure.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="EXAMPLES"><a class="permalink" href="#EXAMPLES">EXAMPLES</a></h1>
First, a simple example of using <b>return</b> to return from a procedure,
  interrupting the procedure body.
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
proc printOneLine {} {
   puts &quot;line 1&quot;    ;# This line will be printed.
   <b>return</b>		
   puts &quot;line 2&quot;    ;# This line will not be printed.
}
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Next, an example of using <b>return</b> to set the value returned
    by the procedure.</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
proc returnX {} {<b>return</b> X}
puts [returnX]    ;# prints &quot;X&quot;
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Next, a more complete example, using <b>return -code error</b> to
    report invalid arguments.</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
proc factorial {n} {
   if {![string is integer $n] || ($n &lt; 0)} {
      <b>return</b> -code error \
            &quot;expected non-negative integer,\
             but got \&quot;$n\&quot;&quot;
   }
   if {$n &lt; 2} {
      <b>return</b> 1

   set m [expr {$n - 1}]
   set code [catch {factorial $m} factor]
   if {$code != 0} {
      <b>return</b> -code $code $factor
   }
   set product [expr {$n * $factor}]
   if {$product &lt; 0} {
      <b>return</b> -code error \
            &quot;overflow computing factorial of $n&quot;
   }
   <b>return</b> $product

</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Next, a procedure replacement for <b>break</b>.</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
proc myBreak {} {
   <b>return</b> -code break
}
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">With the <b>-level 0</b> option, <b>return</b> itself can serve as
    a replacement for <b>break</b>.</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
interp alias {} Break {} <b>return</b> -level 0 -code break

</div>
<p class="Pp">An example of using <b>catch</b> and <b>return -options</b> to

<p class="Pp">Finally an example of advanced use of the <b>return</b> options to
    create a procedure replacement for <b>return</b> itself:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
proc myReturn {args} {
   set result &quot;&quot;
   if {[llength $args] % 2} {
