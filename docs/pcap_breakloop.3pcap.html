<p class="Pp"><b>pcap_breakloop()</b> sets a flag that will force
    <b>pcap_dispatch(3PCAP)</b> or <b>pcap_loop(3PCAP)</b> to return rather than
    looping; they will return the number of packets that have been processed so
    far, or <b>PCAP_ERROR_BREAK</b> if no packets have been processed so
  far.</p>
<p class="Pp">This routine is safe to use inside a signal handler on UNIX or a
    console control handler on Windows, as it merely sets a flag that is checked
    within the loop.</p>
<p class="Pp">The flag is checked in loops reading packets from the OS - a
    signal by itself will not necessarily terminate those loops - as well as in
    loops processing a set of packets returned by the OS. <b>Note that if you
    are catching signals on UNIX systems that support</b> <b>restarting system
    calls after a signal, and calling pcap_breakloop()</b> <b>in the signal
    handler, you must specify, when catching those signals,</b> <b>that system
    calls should NOT be restarted by that signal. Otherwise,</b> <b>if the
    signal interrupted a call reading packets in a live capture,</b> <b>when
    your signal handler returns after calling pcap_breakloop(), the</b> <b>call
    will be restarted, and the loop will not terminate until more</b> <b>packets
    arrive and the call completes.</b></p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Note also that, in a multi-threaded application, if one thread
    is</b> <b>blocked in pcap_dispatch(), pcap_loop(), pcap_next(3PCAP), or
    pcap_next_ex(3PCAP),</b> <b>a call to pcap_breakloop() in a different thread
    will not unblock that</b> <b>thread.</b> You will need to use whatever
    mechanism the OS provides for breaking a thread out of blocking calls in
    order to unblock the thread, such as thread cancellation or thread
    signalling in systems that support POSIX threads, or <b>SetEvent()</b> on
    the result of <b>pcap_getevent()</b> on a <b>pcap_t</b> on which the thread
    is blocked on Windows. Asynchronous procedure calls will not work on
    Windows, as a thread blocked on a <b>pcap_t</b> will not be in an alertable
    state.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that <b>pcap_next()</b> and <b>pcap_next_ex()</b> will, on
    some platforms, loop reading packets from the OS; that loop will not
    necessarily be terminated by a signal, so <b>pcap_breakloop()</b> should be
    used to terminate packet processing even if <b>pcap_next()</b> or
    <b>pcap_next_ex()</b> is being used.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>pcap_breakloop()</b> does not guarantee that no further packets
    will be processed by <b>pcap_dispatch()</b> or <b>pcap_loop()</b> after it
    is called; at most one more packet might be processed.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <b>PCAP_ERROR_BREAK</b> is returned from <b>pcap_dispatch()</b>
    or <b>pcap_loop()</b>, the flag is cleared, so a subsequent call will resume
    reading packets. If a positive number is returned, the flag is not cleared,
    so a subsequent call will return <b>PCAP_ERROR_BREAK</b> and clear the
  flag.</p>
