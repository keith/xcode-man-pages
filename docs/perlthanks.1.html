   give an unbreakable dash, \*(PI will give pi, \*(L" will give a left
   double quote, and \*(R" will give a right double quote.  \*(C+ will
   give a nicer C++.  Capital omega is used to do unbreakable dashes and
   therefore won't be available.  \*(C` and \*(C' expand to `' in nroff,

<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
This program is designed to help you generate and send bug reports (and
  thank-you notes) about perl5 and the modules which ship with it.
<p class="Pp">In most cases, you can just run it interactively from a command
    line without any special arguments and follow the prompts.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you have found a bug with a non-standard port (one that was not
    part of the <i>standard distribution</i>), a binary distribution, or a
    non-core module (such as Tk, DBI, etc), then please see the documentation
    that came with that distribution to determine the correct place to report
    bugs.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you are unable to send your report using <b>perlbug</b> (most
    likely because your system doesn't have a way to send mail that perlbug
    recognizes), you may be able to use this tool to compose your report and
    save it to a file which you can then send to <b>perlbug@perl.org</b> using
    your regular mail client.</p>
<p class="Pp">In extreme cases, <b>perlbug</b> may not work well enough on your
    system to guide you through composing a bug report. In those cases, you may
    be able to use <b>perlbug -d</b> to get system configuration information to
    include in a manually composed bug report to <b>perlbug@perl.org</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">When reporting a bug, please run through this checklist:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>What version of Perl you are running?</dt>
  <dd>Type <span class="Li">&quot;perl -v&quot;</span> at the command line to
      find out.</dd>
  <dt>Are you running the latest released version of perl?</dt>
  <dd>Look at http://www.perl.org/ to find out. If you are not using the latest
      released version, please try to replicate your bug on the latest stable
      release.
    <p class="Pp">Note that reports about bugs in old versions of Perl,
        especially those which indicate you haven't also tested the current
        stable release of Perl, are likely to receive less attention from the
        volunteers who build and maintain Perl than reports about bugs in the
        current release.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This tool isn't appropriate for reporting bugs in any version
        prior to Perl 5.0.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Are you sure what you have is a bug?</dt>
  <dd>A significant number of the bug reports we get turn out to be documented
      features in Perl. Make sure the issue you've run into isn't intentional by
      glancing through the documentation that comes with the Perl distribution.
    <p class="Pp">Given the sheer volume of Perl documentation, this isn't a
        trivial undertaking, but if you can point to documentation that suggests
        the behaviour you're seeing is <i>wrong</i>, your issue is likely to
        receive more attention. You may want to start with <b>perldoc</b>
        perltrap for pointers to common traps that new (and experienced) Perl
        programmers run into.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you're unsure of the meaning of an error message you've run
        across, <b>perldoc</b> perldiag for an explanation. If the message isn't
        in perldiag, it probably isn't generated by Perl. You may have luck
        consulting your operating system documentation instead.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you are on a non-UNIX platform <b>perldoc</b> perlport, as
        some features may be unimplemented or work differently.</p>
    <p class="Pp">You may be able to figure out what's going wrong using the
        Perl debugger. For information about how to use the debugger
        <b>perldoc</b> perldebug.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Do you have a proper test case?</dt>
  <dd>The easier it is to reproduce your bug, the more likely it will be fixed
      -- if nobody can duplicate your problem, it probably won't be addressed.
    <p class="Pp">A good test case has most of these attributes: short, simple
        code; few dependencies on external commands, modules, or libraries; no
        platform-dependent code (unless it's a platform-specific bug); clear,
        simple documentation.</p>
    <p class="Pp">A good test case is almost always a good candidate to be
        included in Perl's test suite. If you have the time, consider writing
        your test case so that it can be easily included into the standard test
        suite.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Have you included all relevant information?</dt>
  <dd>Be sure to include the <b>exact</b> error messages, if any. &quot;Perl
      gave an error&quot; is not an exact error message.
    <p class="Pp">If you get a core dump (or equivalent), you may use a debugger
        (<b>dbx</b>, <b>gdb</b>, etc) to produce a stack trace to include in the
        bug report.</p>
    <p class="Pp">NOTE: unless your Perl has been compiled with debug info
        (often <b>-g</b>), the stack trace is likely to be somewhat hard to use
        because it will most probably contain only the function names and not
        their arguments. If possible, recompile your Perl with debug info and
        reproduce the crash and the stack trace.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Can you describe the bug in plain English?</dt>
  <dd>The easier it is to understand a reproducible bug, the more likely it will
      be fixed. Any insight you can provide into the problem will help a great
      deal. In other words, try to analyze the problem (to the extent you can)
      and report your discoveries.</dd>
  <dt>Can you fix the bug yourself?</dt>
  <dd>A bug report which <i>includes a patch to fix it</i> will almost
      definitely be fixed. When sending a patch, please use the
      <span class="Li">&quot;diff&quot;</span> program with the
      <span class="Li">&quot;-u&quot;</span> option to generate
      &quot;unified&quot; diff files. Bug reports with patches are likely to
      receive significantly more attention and interest than those without
      patches.
    <p class="Pp">Your patch may be returned with requests for changes, or
        requests for more detailed explanations about your fix.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Here are a few hints for creating high-quality patches:</p>
    <p class="Pp">Make sure the patch is not reversed (the first argument to
        diff is typically the original file, the second argument your changed
        file). Make sure you test your patch by applying it with the
        <span class="Li">&quot;patch&quot;</span> program before you send it on
        its way. Try to follow the same style as the code you are trying to
        patch. Make sure your patch really does work
        (<span class="Li">&quot;make test&quot;</span>, if the thing you're
        patching is covered by Perl's test suite).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Can you use &quot;perlbug&quot; to submit the report?</dt>
  <dd><b>perlbug</b> will, amongst other things, ensure your report includes
      crucial information about your version of perl. If
      <span class="Li">&quot;perlbug&quot;</span> is unable to mail your report
      after you have typed it in, you may have to compose the message yourself,
      add the output produced by <span class="Li">&quot;perlbug</span>
      <span class="Li">-d&quot;</span> and email it to <b>perlbug@perl.org</b>.
      If, for some reason, you cannot run
      <span class="Li">&quot;perlbug&quot;</span> at all on your system, be sure
      to include the entire output produced by running
      <span class="Li">&quot;perl -V&quot;</span> (note the uppercase V).
    <p class="Pp">Whether you use <span class="Li">&quot;perlbug&quot;</span> or
        send the email manually, please make your Subject line informative.
        &quot;a bug&quot; is not informative. Neither is &quot;perl
        crashes&quot; nor is &quot;HELP!!!&quot;. These don't help. A compact
        description of what's wrong is fine.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Can you use &quot;perlbug&quot; to submit a thank-you note?</dt>
  <dd>Yes, you can do this by either using the
      <span class="Li">&quot;-T&quot;</span> option, or by invoking the program
      as <span class="Li">&quot;perlthanks&quot;</span>. Thank-you notes are
      good. It makes people smile.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Having done your bit, please be prepared to wait, to be told the
    bug is in your code, or possibly to get no reply at all. The volunteers who
    maintain Perl are busy folks, so if your problem is an obvious bug in your
    own code, is difficult to understand or is a duplicate of an existing
    report, you may not receive a personal reply.</p>
<p class="Pp">If it is important to you that your bug be fixed, do monitor the
    perl5-porters@perl.org mailing list and the commit logs to development
    versions of Perl, and encourage the maintainers with kind words or offers of
    frosty beverages. (Please do be kind to the maintainers. Harassing or
    flaming them is likely to have the opposite effect of the one you want.)</p>
<p class="Pp">Feel free to update the ticket about your bug on
    http://rt.perl.org if a new version of Perl is released and your bug is
    still present.</p>

      using <b>-f</b>. Only prompts for a return address if it cannot guess it
      (for use with <b>make</b>). Honors return address specified with
      <b>-r</b>. You can use this with <b>-v</b> to get more complete data. Only
      makes a report if this system is less than 60 days old.</dd>
