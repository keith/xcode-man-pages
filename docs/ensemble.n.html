   The definitions below are for supplemental macros used in Tcl/Tk
   manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget.  The
  	options follow on successive lines, in four columns separated
  	by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   SCCS: @(#) man.macros 1.9 97/08/22 18:50:59
  
  	# Set up traps and other miscellaneous stuff for Tcl/Tk man pages.
  	# Start an argument description
  .b
  	# define tabbing values for .AP
  
  	# BS - start boxed text
  	# ^y = starting y location
  	# ^b = 1
  	# BE - end boxed text (draw box now)
  	Draw four-sided box normally, but don't draw top of
  	box if the box started on an earlier page.
  	# VS - start vertical sidebar
  	# ^Y = starting y location
  	# ^v = 1 (for troff;  for nroff this doesn't matter)
  	# VE - end of vertical sidebar
  	# Special macro to handle page bottom:  finish off current
  	# box/sidebar if in box/sidebar mode, then invoked standard
  	# page bottom macro.
  	Draw three-sided box if this is the box's first page,
  	draw two sides but no top otherwise.
  	# DS - begin display
  	# DE - end display
  	# SO - start of list of standard options
  	# SE - end of list of standard options
  	# OP - start of full description for a single option
  	# CS - begin code excerpt
  	# CE - end code excerpt

The <b>ensemble</b> command is used to create or modify a composite command. See
  the section <b>WHAT IS AN ENSEMBLE?</b> below for a brief overview of
  ensembles.
<p class="Pp">If the <b>ensemble</b> command finds an existing ensemble called
    <i>ensName</i>, it updates that ensemble. Otherwise, it creates an ensemble
    called <i>ensName</i>. If the <i>ensName</i> is a simple name like
    &quot;foo&quot;, then an ensemble command named &quot;foo&quot; is added to
    the current namespace context. If a command named &quot;foo&quot; already
    exists in that context, then it is deleted. If the <i>ensName</i> contains
    namespace qualifiers like &quot;a::b::foo&quot;, then the namespace path is
    resolved, and the ensemble command is added that namespace context. Parent
    namespaces like &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are created automatically,
    as needed.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the <i>ensName</i> contains spaces like &quot;a::b::foo bar
    baz&quot;, then additional words like &quot;bar&quot; and &quot;baz&quot;
    are treated as sub-ensembles. Sub-ensembles are merely parts within an
    ensemble; they do not have a Tcl command associated with them. An ensemble
    like &quot;foo&quot; can have a sub-ensemble called &quot;foo bar&quot;,
    which in turn can have a sub-ensemble called &quot;foo bar baz&quot;. In
    this case, the sub-ensemble &quot;foo bar&quot; must be created before the
    sub-ensemble &quot;foo bar baz&quot; that resides within it.</p>
<p class="Pp">If there are any arguments following <i>ensName</i>, then they are
    treated as commands, and they are executed to update the ensemble. The
    following commands are recognized in this context: <b>part</b> and
    <b>ensemble</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>part</b> command defines a new part for the ensemble. Its
    syntax is identical to the usual <b>proc</b> command, but it defines a part
    within an ensemble, instead of a Tcl command. If a part called
    <i>partName</i> already exists within the ensemble, then the <b>part</b>
    command returns an error.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>ensemble</b> command can be nested inside another
    <b>ensemble</b> command to define a sub-ensemble.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="WHAT_IS_AN_ENSEMBLE?"><a class="permalink" href="#WHAT_IS_AN_ENSEMBLE?">WHAT
  IS AN ENSEMBLE?</a></h1>
The usual &quot;info&quot; command is a composite command--the command name
  <b>info</b> must be followed by a sub-command like <b>body</b> or
  <b>globals</b>. We will refer to a command like <b>info</b> as an
  <i>ensemble</i>, and to sub-commands like <b>body</b> or <b>globals</b> as its
  <i>parts</i>.
<p class="Pp">Ensembles can be nested. For example, the <b>info</b> command has
    an ensemble <b>info namespace</b> within it. This ensemble has parts like
    <b>info namespace all</b> and <b>info namespace children</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">With ensembles, composite commands can be created and extended in
    an automatic way. Any package can find an existing ensemble and add new
    parts to it. So extension writers can add their own parts, for example, to
    the <b>info</b> command.</p>
<p class="Pp">The ensemble facility manages all of the part names and keeps
    track of unique abbreviations. Normally, you can abbreviate <b>info
    complete</b> to <b>info comp</b>. But if an extension adds the part <b>info
    complexity</b>, the minimum abbreviation for <b>info complete</b> becomes
    <b>info complet</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The ensemble facility not only automates the construction of
    composite commands, but it automates the error handling as well. If you
    invoke an ensemble command without specifying a part name, you get an
    automatically generated error message that summarizes the usage information.
    For example, when the <b>info</b> command is invoked without any arguments,
    it produces the following error message:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
wrong # args: should be one of...
  info args procname
  info body procname
  info cmdcount
  info commands ?pattern?
  info complete command
  info context
  info default procname arg varname
  info exists varName
  info globals ?pattern?
  info level ?number?
  info library
  info locals ?pattern?
  info namespace option ?arg arg ...?
  info patchlevel
  info procs ?pattern?
  info protection ?-command? ?-variable? name
  info script
  info tclversion
  info vars ?pattern?
  info which ?-command? ?-variable? ?-namespace? name
</pre>
</div>
You can also customize the way an ensemble responds to errors. When an ensemble
  encounters an unspecified or ambiguous part name, it looks for a part called
  <b>@error</b>. If it exists, then it is used to handle the error. This part
  will receive all of the arguments on the command line starting with the
  offending part name. It can find another way of resolving the command, or
  generate its own error message.
<p class="Pp"></p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="EXAMPLE"><a class="permalink" href="#EXAMPLE">EXAMPLE</a></h1>
We could use an ensemble to clean up the syntax of the various &quot;wait&quot;
  commands in Tcl/Tk. Instead of using a series of strange commands like this:
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
vwait x
tkwait visibility .top
tkwait window .
</pre>
</div>
we could use commands with a uniform syntax, like this:
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
wait variable x
wait visibility .top
wait window .
</pre>
</div>
The Tcl package could define the following ensemble:
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
itcl::ensemble wait part variable {name} {
    uplevel vwait $name
}
</pre>
</div>
The Tk package could add some options to this ensemble, with a command like
  this:
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
itcl::ensemble wait {
    part visibility {name} {
        tkwait visibility $name
    }
    part window {name} {
        tkwait window $name
    }
}
</pre>
</div>
Other extensions could add their own parts to the <b>wait</b> command too.
