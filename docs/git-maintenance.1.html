<p class="Pp">Run tasks to optimize Git repository data, speeding up other Git
    commands and reducing storage requirements for the repository.</p>
<p class="Pp">Git commands that add repository data, such as <b>git</b>
    <b>add</b> or <b>git</b> <b>fetch</b>, are optimized for a responsive user
    experience. These commands do not take time to optimize the Git data, since
    such optimizations scale with the full size of the repository while these
    user commands each perform a relatively small action.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>git</b> <b>maintenance</b> command provides flexibility for
    how to optimize the Git repository.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="SUBCOMMANDS"><a class="permalink" href="#SUBCOMMANDS">SUBCOMMANDS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">run</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Run one or more maintenance tasks. If one or more
  <b>--task</b> options are specified, then those tasks are run in that order.
  Otherwise, the tasks are determined by which
  <b>maintenance.</b><i>&lt;task&gt;</i><b>.enabled</b> config options are true.
  By default, only <b>maintenance.gc.enabled</b> is true.</div>
<p class="Pp">start</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Start running maintenance on the current repository. This
  performs the same config updates as the <b>register</b> subcommand, then
  updates the background scheduler to run <b>git</b> <b>maintenance</b>
  <b>run</b> <b>--scheduled</b> on an hourly basis.</div>
<p class="Pp">stop</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Halt the background maintenance schedule. The current
  repository is not removed from the list of maintained repositories, in case
  the background maintenance is restarted later.</div>
<p class="Pp">register</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Initialize Git config values so any scheduled maintenance
  will start running on this repository. This adds the repository to the
  <b>maintenance.repo</b> config variable in the current user&#x2019;s global
  config, or the config specified by --config-file option, and enables some
  recommended configuration values for
  <b>maintenance.</b><i>&lt;task&gt;</i><b>.schedule</b>. The tasks that are
  enabled are safe for running in the background without disrupting foreground
  processes.
<p class="Pp">The <b>register</b> subcommand will also set the
    <b>maintenance.strategy</b> config value to <b>incremental</b>, if this
    value is not previously set. The <b>incremental</b> strategy uses the
    following schedule for each maintenance task:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>gc</b>: disabled.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>commit-graph</b>: hourly.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>prefetch</b>: hourly.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>loose-objects</b>: daily.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>incremental-repack</b>: daily.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>git</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>register</b> will also disable
    foreground maintenance by setting <b>maintenance.auto</b> <b>=</b>
    <b>false</b> in the current repository. This config setting will remain
    after a <b>git</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>unregister</b> command.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">unregister</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Remove the current repository from background
  maintenance. This only removes the repository from the configured list. It
  does not stop the background maintenance processes from running.
<p class="Pp">The <b>unregister</b> subcommand will report an error if the
    current repository is not already registered. Use the <b>--force</b> option
    to return success even when the current repository is not registered.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="TASKS"><a class="permalink" href="#TASKS">TASKS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">commit-graph</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The <b>commit-graph</b> job updates the
  <b>commit-graph</b> files incrementally, then verifies that the written data
  is correct. The incremental write is safe to run alongside concurrent Git
  processes since it will not expire .<b>graph</b> files that were in the
  previous <b>commit-graph-chain</b> file. They will be deleted by a later run
  based on the expiration delay.</div>
<p class="Pp">prefetch</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The <b>prefetch</b> task updates the object directory
  with the latest objects from all registered remotes. For each remote, a
  <b>git</b> <b>fetch</b> command is run. The configured refspec is modified to
  place all requested refs within <b>refs/prefetch/</b>. Also, tags are not
  updated.
<p class="Pp">This is done to avoid disrupting the remote-tracking branches. The
    end users expect these refs to stay unmoved unless they initiate a fetch.
    However, with the prefetch task, the objects necessary to complete a later
    real fetch would already be obtained, making the real fetch faster. In the
    ideal case, it will just become an update to a bunch of remote-tracking
    branches without any object transfer.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>remote.</b><i>&lt;name&gt;</i><b>.skipFetchAll</b>
    configuration can be used to exclude a particular remote from getting
    prefetched.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">gc</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Clean up unnecessary files and optimize the local
  repository. &quot;GC&quot; stands for &quot;garbage collection,&quot; but this
  task performs many smaller tasks. This task can be expensive for large
  repositories, as it repacks all Git objects into a single pack-file. It can
  also be disruptive in some situations, as it deletes stale data. See
  <b>git-gc</b>(1) for more details on garbage collection in Git.</div>
<p class="Pp">loose-objects</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The <b>loose-objects</b> job cleans up loose objects and
  places them into pack-files. In order to prevent race conditions with
  concurrent Git commands, it follows a two-step process. First, it deletes any
  loose objects that already exist in a pack-file; concurrent Git processes will
  examine the pack-file for the object data instead of the loose object. Second,
  it creates a new pack-file (starting with &quot;loose-&quot;) containing a
  batch of loose objects.
<p class="Pp">The batch size defaults to fifty thousand objects to prevent the
    job from taking too long on a repository with many loose objects. Use the
    <b>maintenance.loose-objects.batchSize</b> config option to adjust this
    size, including a value of <b>0</b> to remove the limit.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>gc</b> task writes unreachable objects as loose objects to
    be cleaned up by a later step only if they are not re-added to a pack-file;
    for this reason it is not advisable to enable both the <b>loose-objects</b>
    and <b>gc</b> tasks at the same time.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">incremental-repack</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The <b>incremental-repack</b> job repacks the object
  directory using the <b>multi-pack-index</b> feature. In order to prevent race
  conditions with concurrent Git commands, it follows a two-step process. First,
  it calls <b>git</b> <b>multi-pack-index</b> <b>expire</b> to delete pack-files
  unreferenced by the <b>multi-pack-index</b> file. Second, it calls <b>git</b>
  <b>multi-pack-index</b> <b>repack</b> to select several small pack-files and
  repack them into a bigger one, and then update the <b>multi-pack-index</b>
  entries that refer to the small pack-files to refer to the new pack-file. This
  prepares those small pack-files for deletion upon the next run of <b>git</b>
  <b>multi-pack-index</b> <b>expire</b>. The selection of the small pack-files
  is such that the expected size of the big pack-file is at least the batch
  size; see the <b>--batch-size</b> option for the <b>repack</b> subcommand in
  <b>git-multi-pack-index</b>(1). The default batch-size is zero, which is a
  special case that attempts to repack all pack-files into a single
  pack-file.</div>
<p class="Pp">pack-refs</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The <b>pack-refs</b> task collects the loose reference
  files and collects them into a single file. This speeds up operations that
  need to iterate across many references. See <b>git-pack-refs</b>(1) for more
  information.</div>
<p class="Pp">reflog-expire</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The <b>reflog-expire</b> task deletes any entries in the
  reflog older than the expiry threshold. See <b>git-reflog</b>(1) for more
  information.</div>
<p class="Pp">rerere-gc</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The <b>rerere-gc</b> task invokes garbage collection for
  stale entries in the rerere cache. See <b>git-rerere</b>(1) for more
  information.</div>
<p class="Pp">worktree-prune</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The <b>worktree-prune</b> task deletes stale or broken
  worktrees. See <b>git-worktree</b>(1) for more information.</div>

<p class="Pp">--auto</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When combined with the <b>run</b> subcommand, run
  maintenance tasks only if certain thresholds are met. For example, the
  <b>gc</b> task runs when the number of loose objects exceeds the number stored
  in the <b>gc.auto</b> config setting, or when the number of pack-files exceeds
  the <b>gc.autoPackLimit</b> config setting. Not compatible with the
  <b>--schedule</b> option.</div>
<p class="Pp">--schedule</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When combined with the <b>run</b> subcommand, run
  maintenance tasks only if certain time conditions are met, as specified by the
  <b>maintenance.</b><i>&lt;task&gt;</i><b>.schedule</b> config value for each
  <i>&lt;task&gt;</i>. This config value specifies a number of seconds since the
  last time that task ran, according to the
  <b>maintenance.</b><i>&lt;task&gt;</i><b>.lastRun</b> config value. The tasks
  that are tested are those provided by the <b>--task=</b><i>&lt;task&gt;</i>
  option(s) or those with <b>maintenance.</b><i>&lt;task&gt;</i><b>.enabled</b>
  set to true.</div>
<p class="Pp">--quiet</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Do not report progress or other information over
  <b>stderr</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--task=&lt;task&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If this option is specified one or more times, then only
  run the specified tasks in the specified order. If no
  <b>--task=</b><i>&lt;task&gt;</i> arguments are specified, then only the tasks
  with <b>maintenance.</b><i>&lt;task&gt;</i><b>.enabled</b> configured as
  <b>true</b> are considered. See the <i>TASKS</i> section for the list of
  accepted <i>&lt;task&gt;</i> values.</div>
<p class="Pp">--scheduler=auto|crontab|systemd-timer|launchctl|schtasks</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When combined with the <b>start</b> subcommand, specify
  the scheduler for running the hourly, daily and weekly executions of
  <b>git</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>run</b>. Possible values for
  <i>&lt;scheduler&gt;</i> are <b>auto</b>, <b>crontab</b> (POSIX),
  <b>systemd-timer</b> (Linux), <b>launchctl</b> (macOS), and <b>schtasks</b>
  (Windows). When <b>auto</b> is specified, the appropriate platform-specific
  scheduler is used; on Linux, <b>systemd-timer</b> is used if available,
  otherwise <b>crontab</b>. Default is <b>auto</b>.</div>

<h1 class="Sh" id="TROUBLESHOOTING"><a class="permalink" href="#TROUBLESHOOTING">TROUBLESHOOTING</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The <b>git</b> <b>maintenance</b> command is designed to simplify
    the repository maintenance patterns while minimizing user wait time during
    Git commands. A variety of configuration options are available to allow
    customizing this process. The default maintenance options focus on
    operations that complete quickly, even on large repositories.</p>
<p class="Pp">Users may find some cases where scheduled maintenance tasks do not
    run as frequently as intended. Each <b>git</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>run</b>
    command takes a lock on the repository&#x2019;s object database, and this
    prevents other concurrent <b>git</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>run</b> commands
    from running on the same repository. Without this safeguard, competing
    processes could leave the repository in an unpredictable state.</p>
<p class="Pp">The background maintenance schedule runs <b>git</b>
    <b>maintenance</b> <b>run</b> processes on an hourly basis. Each run
    executes the &quot;hourly&quot; tasks. At midnight, that process also
    executes the &quot;daily&quot; tasks. At midnight on the first day of the
    week, that process also executes the &quot;weekly&quot; tasks. A single
    process iterates over each registered repository, performing the scheduled
    tasks for that frequency. The processes are scheduled to a random minute of
    the hour per client to spread out the load that multiple clients might
    generate (e.g. from prefetching). Depending on the number of registered
    repositories and their sizes, this process may take longer than an hour. In
    this case, multiple <b>git</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>run</b> commands may
    run on the same repository at the same time, colliding on the object
    database lock. This results in one of the two tasks not running.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you find that some maintenance windows are taking longer than
    one hour to complete, then consider reducing the complexity of your
    maintenance tasks. For example, the <b>gc</b> task is much slower than the
    <b>incremental-repack</b> task. However, this comes at a cost of a slightly
    larger object database. Consider moving more expensive tasks to be run less
    frequently.</p>
<p class="Pp">Expert users may consider scheduling their own maintenance tasks
    using a different schedule than is available through <b>git</b>
    <b>maintenance</b> <b>start</b> and Git configuration options. These users
    should be aware of the object database lock and how concurrent <b>git</b>
    <b>maintenance</b> <b>run</b> commands behave. Further, the <b>git</b>
    <b>gc</b> command should not be combined with <b>git</b> <b>maintenance</b>
    <b>run</b> commands. <b>git</b> <b>gc</b> modifies the object database but
    does not take the lock in the same way as <b>git</b> <b>maintenance</b>
    <b>run</b>. If possible, use <b>git</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>run</b>
    <b>--task=gc</b> instead of <b>git</b> <b>gc</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following sections describe the mechanisms put in place to run
    background maintenance by <b>git</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>start</b> and how
    to customize them.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="BACKGROUND_MAINTENANCE_ON_POSIX_SYSTEMS"><a class="permalink" href="#BACKGROUND_MAINTENANCE_ON_POSIX_SYSTEMS">BACKGROUND
  MAINTENANCE ON POSIX SYSTEMS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The standard mechanism for scheduling background tasks on POSIX
    systems is cron(8). This tool executes commands based on a given schedule.
    The current list of user-scheduled tasks can be found by running
    <b>crontab</b> <b>-l</b>. The schedule written by <b>git</b>
    <b>maintenance</b> <b>start</b> is similar to this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre># BEGIN GIT MAINTENANCE SCHEDULE
# The following schedule was created by Git
# Any edits made in this region might be
# replaced in the future by a Git command.
0 1-23 * * * &quot;/&lt;path&gt;/git&quot; --exec-path=&quot;/&lt;path&gt;&quot; for-each-repo --config=maintenance.repo maintenance run --schedule=hourly
0 0 * * 1-6 &quot;/&lt;path&gt;/git&quot; --exec-path=&quot;/&lt;path&gt;&quot; for-each-repo --config=maintenance.repo maintenance run --schedule=daily
0 0 * * 0 &quot;/&lt;path&gt;/git&quot; --exec-path=&quot;/&lt;path&gt;&quot; for-each-repo --config=maintenance.repo maintenance run --schedule=weekly
# END GIT MAINTENANCE SCHEDULE</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The comments are used as a region to mark the schedule as written
    by Git. Any modifications within this region will be completely deleted by
    <b>git</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>stop</b> or overwritten by <b>git</b>
    <b>maintenance</b> <b>start</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>crontab</b> entry specifies the full path of the <b>git</b>
    executable to ensure that the executed <b>git</b> command is the same one
    with which <b>git</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>start</b> was issued independent
    of <b>PATH</b>. If the same user runs <b>git</b> <b>maintenance</b>
    <b>start</b> with multiple Git executables, then only the latest executable
    is used.</p>
<p class="Pp">These commands use <b>git</b> <b>for-each-repo</b>
    <b>--config=maintenance.repo</b> to run <b>git</b> <b>maintenance</b>
    <b>run</b> <b>--schedule=</b><i>&lt;frequency&gt;</i> on each repository
    listed in the multi-valued <b>maintenance.repo</b> config option. These are
    typically loaded from the user-specific global config. The <b>git</b>
    <b>maintenance</b> process then determines which maintenance tasks are
    configured to run on each repository with each <i>&lt;frequency&gt;</i>
    using the <b>maintenance.</b><i>&lt;task&gt;</i><b>.schedule</b> config
    options. These values are loaded from the global or repository config
    values.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the config values are insufficient to achieve your desired
    background maintenance schedule, then you can create your own schedule. If
    you run <b>crontab</b> <b>-e</b>, then an editor will load with your
    user-specific <b>cron</b> schedule. In that editor, you can add your own
    schedule lines. You could start by adapting the default schedule listed
    earlier, or you could read the crontab(5) documentation for advanced
    scheduling techniques. Please do use the full path and <b>--exec-path</b>
    techniques from the default schedule to ensure you are executing the correct
    binaries in your schedule.</p>

  MAINTENANCE ON LINUX SYSTEMD SYSTEMS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">While Linux supports <b>cron</b>, depending on the distribution,
    <b>cron</b> may be an optional package not necessarily installed. On modern
    Linux distributions, systemd timers are superseding it.</p>
<p class="Pp">If user systemd timers are available, they will be used as a
    replacement of <b>cron</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">In this case, <b>git</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>start</b> will
    create user systemd timer units and start the timers. The current list of
    user-scheduled tasks can be found by running <b>systemctl</b> <b>--user</b>
    <b>list-timers</b>. The timers written by <b>git</b> <b>maintenance</b>
    <b>start</b> are similar to this:</p>

</div>
<p class="Pp">One timer is registered for each
    <b>--schedule=</b><i>&lt;frequency&gt;</i> option.</p>
<p class="Pp">The definition of the systemd units can be inspected in the

~/.config/systemd/user/timers.target.wants/git-maintenance@weekly.timer</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>git</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>start</b> will overwrite these

    customization should be done by creating a drop-in file, i.e. a .<b>conf</b>
    suffixed file in the
    <b>~/.config/systemd/user/git-maintenance@.service.d</b> directory.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>git</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>stop</b> will stop the user
    systemd timers and delete the above mentioned files.</p>
<p class="Pp">For more details, see <b>systemd.timer</b>(<b>5</b>).</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="BACKGROUND_MAINTENANCE_ON_MACOS_SYSTEMS"><a class="permalink" href="#BACKGROUND_MAINTENANCE_ON_MACOS_SYSTEMS">BACKGROUND
  MAINTENANCE ON MACOS SYSTEMS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">While macOS technically supports <b>cron</b>, using <b>crontab</b>
    <b>-e</b> requires elevated privileges and the executed process does not
    have a full user context. Without a full user context, Git and its
    credential helpers cannot access stored credentials, so some maintenance
    tasks are not functional.</p>
<p class="Pp">Instead, <b>git</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>start</b> interacts with
    the <b>launchctl</b> tool, which is the recommended way to schedule timed
    jobs in macOS. Scheduling maintenance through <b>git</b> <b>maintenance</b>
    (<b>start</b>|<b>stop</b>) requires some <b>launchctl</b> features available
    only in macOS 10.11 or later.</p>
<p class="Pp">Your user-specific scheduled tasks are stored as XML-formatted
    .<b>plist</b> files in <b>~/Library/LaunchAgents/</b>. You can see the
    currently-registered tasks using the following command:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ ls ~/Library/LaunchAgents/org.git-scm.git*
org.git-scm.git.daily.plist
org.git-scm.git.hourly.plist
org.git-scm.git.weekly.plist</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">One task is registered for each
    <b>--schedule=</b><i>&lt;frequency&gt;</i> option. To inspect how the XML
    format describes each schedule, open one of these .<b>plist</b> files in an
    editor and inspect the <i>&lt;array&gt;</i> element following the
    <i>&lt;key&gt;</i><b>StartCalendarInterval</b>&lt;/key&gt; element.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>git</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>start</b> will overwrite these
    files and register the tasks again with <b>launchctl</b>, so any
    customizations should be done by creating your own .<b>plist</b> files with
    distinct names. Similarly, the <b>git</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>stop</b>
    command will unregister the tasks with <b>launchctl</b> and delete the
    .<b>plist</b> files.</p>
<p class="Pp">To create more advanced customizations to your background tasks,
    see launchctl.plist(5) for more information.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="BACKGROUND_MAINTENANCE_ON_WINDOWS_SYSTEMS"><a class="permalink" href="#BACKGROUND_MAINTENANCE_ON_WINDOWS_SYSTEMS">BACKGROUND
  MAINTENANCE ON WINDOWS SYSTEMS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Windows does not support <b>cron</b> and instead has its own
    system for scheduling background tasks. The <b>git</b> <b>maintenance</b>
    <b>start</b> command uses the <b>schtasks</b> command to submit tasks to
    this system. You can inspect all background tasks using the Task Scheduler
    application. The tasks added by Git have names of the form <b>Git</b>
    <b>Maintenance</b> (<i>&lt;frequency&gt;</i>). The Task Scheduler GUI has
    ways to inspect these tasks, but you can also export the tasks to XML files
    and view the details there.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that since Git is a console application, these background
    tasks create a console window visible to the current user. This can be
    changed manually by selecting the &quot;Run whether user is logged in or
    not&quot; option in Task Scheduler. This change requires a password input,
    which is why <b>git</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>start</b> does not select it
    by default.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you want to customize the background tasks, please rename the
    tasks so future calls to <b>git</b> <b>maintenance</b>
    (<b>start</b>|<b>stop</b>) do not overwrite your custom tasks.</p>

<p class="Pp">Everything below this line in this section is selectively included
    from the <b>git-config</b>(1) documentation. The content is the same as
    what&#x2019;s found there:</p>
<p class="Pp">maintenance.auto</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This boolean config option controls whether some commands
  run <b>git</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>run</b> <b>--auto</b> after doing their
  normal work. Defaults to true.</div>
<p class="Pp">maintenance.autoDetach</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Many Git commands trigger automatic maintenance after
  they have written data into the repository. This boolean config option
  controls whether this automatic maintenance shall happen in the foreground or
  whether the maintenance process shall detach and continue to run in the
  background.
<p class="Pp">If unset, the value of <b>gc.autoDetach</b> is used as a fallback.
    Defaults to true if both are unset, meaning that the maintenance process
    will detach.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">maintenance.strategy</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This string config option provides a way to specify one
  of a few recommended schedules for background maintenance. This only affects
  which tasks are run during <b>git</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>run</b>
  <b>--schedule=X</b> commands, provided no <b>--task=</b><i>&lt;task&gt;</i>
  arguments are provided. Further, if a
  <b>maintenance.</b><i>&lt;task&gt;</i><b>.schedule</b> config value is set,
  then that value is used instead of the one provided by
  <b>maintenance.strategy</b>. The possible strategy strings are:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>none</b>: This default setting implies no
  tasks are run at any schedule.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>incremental</b>: This setting optimizes for
  performing small maintenance activities that do not delete any data. This does
  not schedule the <b>gc</b> task, but runs the <b>prefetch</b> and
  <b>commit-graph</b> tasks hourly, the <b>loose-objects</b> and
  <b>incremental-repack</b> tasks daily, and the <b>pack-refs</b> task
  weekly.</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp">maintenance.&lt;task&gt;.enabled</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This boolean config option controls whether the
  maintenance task with name <i>&lt;task&gt;</i> is run when no <b>--task</b>
  option is specified to <b>git</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>run</b>. These config
  values are ignored if a <b>--task</b> option exists. By default, only
  <b>maintenance.gc.enabled</b> is true.</div>
<p class="Pp">maintenance.&lt;task&gt;.schedule</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This config option controls whether or not the given
  <i>&lt;task&gt;</i> runs during a <b>git</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>run</b>
  <b>--schedule=</b><i>&lt;frequency&gt;</i> command. The value must be one of
  &quot;hourly&quot;, &quot;daily&quot;, or &quot;weekly&quot;.</div>
<p class="Pp">maintenance.commit-graph.auto</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This integer config option controls how often the
  <b>commit-graph</b> task should be run as part of <b>git</b>
  <b>maintenance</b> <b>run</b> <b>--auto</b>. If zero, then the
  <b>commit-graph</b> task will not run with the <b>--auto</b> option. A
  negative value will force the task to run every time. Otherwise, a positive
  value implies the command should run when the number of reachable commits that
  are not in the commit-graph file is at least the value of
  <b>maintenance.commit-graph.auto</b>. The default value is 100.</div>
<p class="Pp">maintenance.loose-objects.auto</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This integer config option controls how often the
  <b>loose-objects</b> task should be run as part of <b>git</b>
  <b>maintenance</b> <b>run</b> <b>--auto</b>. If zero, then the
  <b>loose-objects</b> task will not run with the <b>--auto</b> option. A
  negative value will force the task to run every time. Otherwise, a positive
  value implies the command should run when the number of loose objects is at
  least the value of <b>maintenance.loose-objects.auto</b>. The default value is
  100.</div>
<p class="Pp">maintenance.loose-objects.batchSize</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This integer config option controls the maximum number of
  loose objects written into a packfile during the <b>loose-objects</b> task.
  The default is fifty thousand. Use value <b>0</b> to indicate no limit.</div>
<p class="Pp">maintenance.incremental-repack.auto</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This integer config option controls how often the
  <b>incremental-repack</b> task should be run as part of <b>git</b>
  <b>maintenance</b> <b>run</b> <b>--auto</b>. If zero, then the
  <b>incremental-repack</b> task will not run with the <b>--auto</b> option. A
  negative value will force the task to run every time. Otherwise, a positive
  value implies the command should run when the number of pack-files not in the
  multi-pack-index is at least the value of
  <b>maintenance.incremental-repack.auto</b>. The default value is 10.</div>
<p class="Pp">maintenance.reflog-expire.auto</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This integer config option controls how often the
  <b>reflog-expire</b> task should be run as part of <b>git</b>
  <b>maintenance</b> <b>run</b> <b>--auto</b>. If zero, then the
  <b>reflog-expire</b> task will not run with the <b>--auto</b> option. A
  negative value will force the task to run every time. Otherwise, a positive
  value implies the command should run when the number of expired reflog entries
  in the &quot;HEAD&quot; reflog is at least the value of
  <b>maintenance.loose-objects.auto</b>. The default value is 100.</div>
<p class="Pp">maintenance.rerere-gc.auto</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This integer config option controls how often the
  <b>rerere-gc</b> task should be run as part of <b>git</b> <b>maintenance</b>
  <b>run</b> <b>--auto</b>. If zero, then the <b>rerere-gc</b> task will not run
  with the <b>--auto</b> option. A negative value will force the task to run
  every time. Otherwise, any positive value implies the command will run when
  the &quot;rr-cache&quot; directory exists and has at least one entry,
  regardless of whether it is stale or not. This heuristic may be refined in the
  future. The default value is 1.</div>
<p class="Pp">maintenance.worktree-prune.auto</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This integer config option controls how often the
  <b>worktree-prune</b> task should be run as part of <b>git</b>
  <b>maintenance</b> <b>run</b> <b>--auto</b>. If zero, then the
  <b>worktree-prune</b> task will not run with the <b>--auto</b> option. A
  negative value will force the task to run every time. Otherwise, a positive
  value implies the command should run when the number of prunable worktrees
  exceeds the value. The default value is 1.</div>
