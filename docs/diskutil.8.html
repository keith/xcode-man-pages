<p class="Pp"><code class="Nm">diskutil</code> manipulates the structure of
    local disks. It provides information about, and allows the administration
    of, partitioning schemes, layouts, and formats of disks. This includes hard
    disks, solid state disks, optical discs, disk images, APFS volumes,
    CoreStorage volumes, and AppleRAID sets. It generally manipulates whole
    volumes instead of individual files and directories.</p>

<p class="Pp">Many <code class="Nm">diskutil</code> commands, if improperly

    List disks, including internal and external disks, whole disks and
      partitions, and various kinds of virtual or offline disks.
    <p class="Pp">If no argument is given, then all whole disks and their
        partitions are listed.</p>
    <p class="Pp">You can limit the number of disks shown by specifying
        filtering arguments such as <b class="Sy">internal</b> above, and/or a
        <var class="Ar">device</var> disk. When limiting by a disk, you can
        specify either a whole disk, e.g. disk0, or any of its slices, e.g.
        disk0s3, but filtering is only done at the whole disk level (disk0s3 is
        a synonym for disk0 in this case).</p>

    <p class="Pp">The top-to-bottom appearance of all whole disks is sorted in
        numerical order by unit (whole disk) number. However, within each whole
        disk's &quot;sublist&quot; of partitions, the ordering indicates actual
        on-disk location. The first disk item listed represents the partition
        which is located most near the beginning of its encompassing whole disk,
        and so on.</p>
    <p class="Pp">When viewed this way, the slice (partition) parts of the BSD
        disk identifiers may, in certain circumstances, not appear in numerical
        order. This is normal and is likely the result of a recent partition map
        editing operation in which volumes were kept mounted.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that both human-readable and plist output are sorted as
        described above.</p>

    Enable ownership of a volume. The on-root-disk Volume Database at
      /var/db/volinfo.database is manipulated such that the User and Group ID
      settings of files, directories, and links (file system objects, or
      &quot;FSOs&quot;) on the target volume are taken into account.
    <p class="Pp">This setting for a particular volume is persistent across
        ejects and injects of that volume as seen by the current OS, even across
        reboots of that OS, because of the entries in this OS's Volume Database.
        Note thus that the setting is not kept on the target disk, nor is it
        in-memory.</p>
    <p class="Pp">For some locations of devices (e.g. internal hard disks),
        consideration of ownership settings on FSOs is the default. For others
        (e.g. plug-in USB disks), it is not.</p>
    <p class="Pp">When ownership is disabled, Owner and Group ID settings on
        FSOs appear to the user and programs as the current user and group
        instead of their actual on-disk settings, in order to make it easy to
        use a plug-in disk of which the user has physical possession.</p>
    <p class="Pp">When ownership is enabled, the Owner and Group ID settings
        that exist on the disk are taken into account for determining access,
        and exact settings are written to the disk as FSOs are created. A common
        reason for having to enable ownership is when a disk is to contain FSOs
        whose User and Group ID settings, and thus permissions behavior overall,
        is critically important, such as when the plug-in disk contains system
        files to be changed or added to.</p>

        Modern devices have wear-leveling, block-sparing, and
        possibly-persistent cache hardware, which cannot be completely erased by
        these commands. The modern solution for quickly and securely erasing
        your data is encryption. Strongly-encrypted data can be instantly
        &quot;erased&quot; by destroying (or losing) the key (password), because
        this renders your data irretrievable in practical terms. Consider using

    <p class="Pp">If <var class="Ar">device</var> is a (partition map-bearing)
        whole disk, then the new partition will automatically be placed last in
        the map.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Alternatively, you can create a new partition without any
        formatting by providing the partition type manually. To do so, pass a
        <var class="Ar">format</var> parameter in the form of
        <b class="Sy">%</b> followed by a raw GPT UUID or valid human-readable
        ioContent string followed by <b class="Sy">%</b>, together with
        <b class="Sy">%noformat%</b> for <var class="Ar">name</var>. In this
        usage, any old on-disk data at the location of the new partition will be
        &quot;wiped&quot; (partially set to zeroes) to avoid any undesired
        interpretation.</p>
    <p class="Pp">You can request fit-to-fill by specifying a
        <var class="Ar">size</var> of <b class="Sy">0</b>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The partition map scheme must be GPT. A gap must exist at the
        target location, which will generally not be the case unless you have
        resized or deleted partitions. The partition map must contain at least
        one entry (the EFI partition suffices). Ownership of the affected disk
        is required.</p>

    Apple APFS is a system of virtual volumes. APFS verbs can be used to create,
      manipulate and destroy APFS Containers and their APFS Volumes. Apple APFS
      defines these types of objects:
    <ul class="Bl-bullet Bd-indent">
      <li>Container - An APFS Container imports one or more APFS Physical Store
          disks and exports zero or more APFS Volume disks. Zero or more APFS
          Containers can exist in (might be attached to) the system at any one
          time.
        <p class="Pp">While attached, the &quot;handle&quot; by which an APFS
            Container is identified is by its APFS <b class="Sy">Container
            Reference</b> disk (device), e.g. &quot;disk5&quot; or
            &quot;/dev/disk5&quot;. You should treat this as an opaque reference
            token.</p>
        <p class="Pp">The <b class="Sy">Container Reference</b> disk is a
            synthesized whole-disk which is exported by APFS for identification
            purposes only; it has no storage. It is associated with the
            AppleAPFSContainerScheme node in the IO Registry. While APFS Volume
            device identifiers appear to be of a related form, you should never
            use the Container Reference as a basis to create device identifiers
            yourself; use the listing verbs with their plist options
          instead.</p>
        <p class="Pp">An APFS Container has a certain fixed size (capacity)
            which, via its Physical Store(s), uses physical space on a device.
            An APFS Container can be resized, but this is not a part of normal
            operation.</p>
      </li>
      <li>Physical Store - An APFS Physical Store is a disk which is imported
          into (that is, which backs, indeed defines) an APFS Container. An APFS
          Container can import more than one Physical Store, e.g. for
          Fusion-style Containers.
        <p class="Pp">An APFS Physical Store disk is not necessarily a disk from
            a partition map; it could be e.g. an AppleRAID Set disk. Therefore,
            you must never assume that an APFS Physical Store's disk identifier
            is a 2-part form such as disk0s2.</p>
      </li>
      <li>Volume - An APFS Volume is an [un]mountable file system volume which
          is exported from an APFS Container. Zero or more APFS Volumes may be
          exported out of an APFS Container.
        <p class="Pp" id="volumeDevice">An APFS Volume is identified by its
            device node, e.g. &quot;disk5s1&quot; or &quot;/dev/disk5s1&quot;.
            The term
            <a class="permalink" href="#volumeDevice"><b class="Sy">volumeDevice</b></a>
            is used below to refer to this device node.</p>
        <p class="Pp">APFS Volumes have no specified &quot;size&quot;
            (capacity). Instead, all APFS Volumes consume capacity out of the
            remaining free space of their parent APFS Container, consuming or
            returning such capacity as user file data is added or deleted. Note
            that this means that all Volumes within a Container compete for the
            Container's remaining capacity. However, you can manage Volume
            allocation with the optional <b class="Sy">reserve</b> and
            <b class="Sy">quota</b> size values.</p>
        <p class="Pp">The optional <b class="Sy">reserve</b> size requests an
            assured minimum capacity for an APFS Volume. If successfully
            created, the Volume is guaranteed to be able to store at least this
            many bytes of user file data. Note that beyond this, the Volume
            might be able to store even more until constrained by reaching zero
            free space in its parent Container or by reaching a quota, if any.
            You can use a <b class="Sy">reserve</b> to prevent running out of
            capacity due to competition from other Volumes or from a Container
            shrink attempt.</p>
        <p class="Pp">The optional <b class="Sy">quota</b> size applies a
            maximum capacity to an APFS Volume, placing a limit on the number of
            bytes of user file data which can be stored on the Volume. Note that
            you might not be able to reach this limit if its parent Container
            becomes full first. You can use a <b class="Sy">quota</b> to enforce
            accounting or to manage against &quot;unfair&quot; premature
            filling-up of the parent Container due solely to this Volume at the
            expense of sibling Volumes.</p>
        <p class="Pp">APFS Volumes can be tagged with zero or more
            <b class="Sy">role</b> metadata flags which give a hint as to their
            intended use. Not all combinations of flags are valid, and not all
            flags are allowed to be set or changed by a user.</p>
        <p class="Pp" id="COPYFILE_CLONE.">Efficient file copy cloning
            (copy-on-write) is supported; see <a class="Xr">copyfile(3)</a>
            <a class="permalink" href="#COPYFILE_CLONE."><b class="Sy">COPYFILE_CLONE.</b></a></p>
        <p class="Pp">Optional volume-level encryption is supported (see also
            Volume Groups below). An APFS Volume can be in an encrypted state
            because it was converted from a Core Storage encrypted volume, or
            because it was created as encrypted from its inception (e.g. with
            the <b class="Sy">diskutil apfs addVolume -passphrase</b> verb) or
            because FileVault was enabled on it at some later time. On machines
            that support hardware encryption, the on-disk-device data for local
            volumes is encrypted even if FileVault is not enabled; this is
            termed &quot;encrypted at rest&quot;.</p>
        <p class="Pp">The format of an APFS Volume's device identifier
            (volumeDevice) is that of a slice disk of a special whole-disk; both
            disks are synthesized by APFS. The &quot;whole&quot; identifier
            number (a positive possibly-multi-digit integer) is arbitrary, and
            the &quot;slice&quot; numbers (positive possibly-multi-digit
            integers) count up from 1 with each new Volume. Deleting Volumes may
            cause gaps in the numbering. This form appears the same as a
            partition (map) scheme and partitions, but it is completely
            unrelated. For example: If &quot;disk3s2&quot; is a Physical Store
            defining a Container, then &quot;disk5s1&quot;, &quot;disk5s2&quot;,
            and &quot;disk5s3&quot; might be the Container's Volumes;
            &quot;disk5&quot; exists but is never used directly.</p>
        <p class="Pp">Although it has a device node, an APFS Volume's data may
            only be accessed through its files; 3rd-party code cannot open an
            APFS Volume device node to &quot;directly&quot; access its on-disk
            bytes.</p>
      </li>
      <li>Snapshot - An APFS Snapshot represents a read-only copy of its parent
          (or &quot;base&quot;) APFS Volume, frozen at the moment of its
          creation. An APFS Volume can have zero or more associated APFS
          Snapshots.
        <p class="Pp">APFS Snapshots are normally not discoverable unless the
            &quot;base&quot; or one of the snapshots is mounted. APFS Snapshots
            are uniquely identified with a UUID (preferred) or within their
            parent Volume's namespace by either a numeric identifier or by their
            name; they can be renamed, but APFS will never allow duplication of
            names (within a Volume) to occur.</p>
        <p class="Pp">APFS Snapshots are mountable; when this occurs, its mount
            point (separate from and simultaneous with its parent Volume)
            provides a read-only historic version of the Volume content at
            Snapshot creation time.</p>
        <p class="Pp" id="revert">You can
            <a class="permalink" href="#revert"><b class="Sy">revert</b></a> the
            present state of an APFS Volume back to equality with a Snapshot in
            its history. This is a destructive reset/restore operation: Once a
            Volume is reverted, it cannot be brought forward. Any Snapshots
            between the revert point and the present are lost as well.</p>
        <p class="Pp">You can <b class="Sy">delete</b> a Snapshot; this removes
            the possibility of ever reverting to that Snapshot's state, but does
            not affect the Volume's present-time content.</p>
        <p class="Pp" id="s">An APFS Snapshot mount point's &quot;source
            device&quot; (its <a class="Xr">statfs(2)</a>
            <b class="Sy">f_mntfromname</b> shown by the
            <a class="Xr">mount(8)</a> command) is not necessarily a device node
            (e.g. disk0s2) as is common; it can be the Snapshot name followed by
            the '@' character and the &quot;parent&quot; Volume's device node,
            e.g. &quot;SnapName123@/dev/disk2s1&quot;. See the
            <a class="Xr">mount_apfs(8)</a>
            <a class="permalink" href="#s"><b class="Sy">-s</b></a> and
            <a class="Xr">fs_snapshot_create(2)</a> commands. However, it is
            also possible for <b class="Sy">f_mntfromname</b> to have a 3-part
            form (&quot;diskCsVsS&quot;) if you are rooted (booted) from an APFS
            Snapshot; in this case, its &quot;base&quot; Volume (e.g.
            &quot;diskCsV&quot;) will
            <a class="permalink" href="#not"><b class="Sy" id="not">not</b></a>
            be mounted.</p>
      </li>
      <li>Volume Group - Collections of APFS Volumes can be associated with each
          other via an APFS Volume Group. Zero or more APFS Volume Groups may
          exist on any given APFS Container. The &quot;members&quot; (APFS
          Volumes) of any particular APFS Volume Group must all be on the same
          APFS Container. There is no such thing as an &quot;empty&quot;
          (zero-member) APFS Volume Group.
        <p class="Pp">APFS Volume Groups are identified using their Volume Group
            ID (a UUID). Assignment of this ID may be deferred in some
          cases.</p>
        <p class="Pp">A primary use for APFS Volume Groups is realization of
            macOS installations in which &quot;System&quot;-role (for the
            operating system) and &quot;Data&quot;-role (for user data) APFS
            Volumes are functionally linked (overlaid file namespace, crypto
            info), yet separated for reasons of security, backup, and software
            update.</p>
        <p class="Pp">Cryptographic identity, if any, is shared among all
            members of an APFS Volume Group.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="Pp">APFS itself has no provision for backing up your data. Backups
        should be always be performed on a regular basis and before modifying
        any APFS Container using these commands.</p>

        with their descriptions and individual arguments.</p>

        Non-destructively convert an HFS volume to an APFS Container with a
          single (but see below) APFS Volume. The APFS Container can later be
          manipulated (e.g. adding and deleting APFS Volumes) as usual. This
          verb can be used to convert nonbootable &quot;data&quot;-only volumes
          as well as &quot;macOS&quot; volumes (see below).
        <p class="Pp">The source HFS volume can be located on a GPT partition or
            on an encrypted or non-encrypted, Fusion or non-Fusion CoreStorage
            logical volume (LV). In the latter case, the CoreStorage logical
            volume group (LVG) is dismantled, including automatic removal of any

            performed, but your disk is left as valid HFS (headers remain
            declared as HFS, partition types are left alone, etc).</p>
        <p class="Pp" id="prebootSource">For volumes currently or planned to be
            macOS-bearing (and bootable), you can optionally specify
            <a class="permalink" href="#prebootSource"><b class="Sy">-prebootSource</b></a>
            with your own staging directory of macOS boot items; a Preboot Role
            APFS Volume with a UUID directory will automatically be created as
            part of the conversion process to facilitate macOS bootstrap.
            Normally your directory should be writable; additional
            (cryptographic and EFI rendering) items are automatically added to
            your directory prior to conversion and are not removed afterwards.

        Convenience verb which creates an empty APFS Container and then adds one
          APFS Volume with the given name. The APFS Volume will have default
          attributes such as no encryption, no capacity reserve nor quota, etc.
          If you specify more than one device, a Fusion Container is created,
          with the performance parts assigned automatically. This is a
          combination of the <b class="Sy">diskutil apfs createContainer</b> and

        Create an empty APFS Container. The device(s) specified become APFS

            preferred. Rotational vs. solid-state hardware design must be
            detectable; this is often not the case for external disks.

            assumed to be &quot;faster&quot; (you should use solid-state
            hardware if available), while the &quot;secondary&quot; device is
            assumed to be &quot;slower&quot; and is often used to store

        Resize an existing APFS Container by specifying either an APFS Container
          Reference (preferred) or an APFS Physical Store partition, plus a
          proposed new size. Alternatively, take no action and print constraint

    <br/>
    AppleRAID verbs can be used to create, manipulate and destroy AppleRAID
      volumes (Software RAID). AppleRAID supports three basic types of RAID
      sets:
    <ul class="Bl-bullet Bd-indent">
      <li>&quot;stripe&quot; - Striped Volume (RAID 0)</li>
      <li>&quot;mirror&quot; - Mirrored Volume (RAID 1)</li>
      <li>&quot;concat&quot; - Concatenated Volume (Spanning)</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="Pp">Of these three basic types, only the &quot;mirror&quot; type
        increases fault-tolerance. Mirrors may have more than two disks to
        further increase their fault-tolerance. Striped and concatentated
        volumes are, in fact, more vulnerable to faults than single disk
        volumes.</p>
    <p class="Pp">From these basic types, &quot;stacked&quot; or
        &quot;nested&quot; RAID volumes can be created. Stacked RAID sets that
        make use of mirrored RAID sets are fault-tolerant. For example, these
        are some of the more common combinations of stacked RAID sets:</p>
    <ul class="Bl-bullet Bd-indent">
      <li>RAID 50 - A striped RAID set of hardware RAID 5 disks.</li>
      <li>RAID 10 - A striped RAID set of mirrored RAID sets.</li>
      <li>RAID 0+1 - A mirrored RAID set of striped RAID sets.</li>
      <li>Concatenated Mirror - A concatenation of mirrored RAID sets.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="Pp">When creating new RAID sets or adding disks, if possible, it
        is better to specify the entire disk instead of a partition on that
        disk. This allows the software to reformat the entire disk using the
        most current partition layouts. When using whole disks, the type of
        partitioning used is selected based on the platform type (PPC =
        APMFormat, Intel = GPTFormat). GPT and APM partition formats cannot be
        mixed in the same RAID set.</p>
    <p class="Pp">In addition to whole disk and partition device names,
        AppleRAID uses UUIDs to refer to existing RAID sets and their members.
        Existing RAID sets may also be specified by mount point (e.g.
        <span class="Pa">/Volume/raidset</span>). In many cases, using the UUID
        for the device argument is preferred because disk device names may
        change over time when disks are added, disks are removed or when the
        system is rebooted. If RAID members have been physically disconnected
        from the system or are no longer responding, you must use the member's
        UUID as the command argument. Messages in the system log will refer to
        RAID sets and their member disks by UUID. For more information on
        specifying device arguments, see the <b class="Sy">DEVICES</b> section
        below.</p>
    <p class="Pp">AppleRAID is not a replacement for backing up your data.
        Backups should be always be performed on a regular basis and before
        modifying any RAID set using these commands.</p>

          RAID set. Disks that were originally partitioned on Mac OS X 10.2
          Jaguar or earlier or were partitioned to be Mac OS 9 compatible may
          not be resizable. Ownership of the affected disk is required.

    CoreStorage verbs can be used to gather information about, and to remove,
      CoreStorage volumes.
    <p class="Pp">CoreStorage maintains a world of virtual disks, somewhat like
        RAID, in which one can easily add or remove imported backing store
        disks, as well as exported usable volumes, to or from a pool (or several
        pools). This provides the user with flexibility in allocating their
        hardware; user or operating system data can span multiple physical disks
        seamlessly, for example.</p>
    <p class="Pp">CoreStorage is deprecated in favor of Apple APFS.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Apple CoreStorage defines four types of objects, instances of
        which are uniquely represented by a UUID:</p>
    <ul class="Bl-bullet Bd-indent">
      <li>Logical Volume Group (LVG)</li>
      <li>Physical Volume (PV)</li>
      <li>Logical Volume Family (LVF)</li>
      <li>Logical Volume (LV)</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="Pp">The Logical Volume Group (LVG) is the top or &quot;pool&quot;
        level; zero or more may exist during any OS boot time session.</p>
    <p class="Pp">An LVG imports one or more Physical Volumes (PVs). A PV
        represents a device that feeds the LVG storage space; a PV is normally
        real media but it can be a disk image or even an AppleRAID Set. A disk
        offered to be a PV must be a partition and the encompassing scheme must
        be GPT.</p>
    <p class="Pp">An LVG exports zero or more Logical Volume Families (LVFs). An
        LVF contains properties which govern and bind together all of its
        descendant Logical Volumes (LVs). These properties provide settings for
        Full Disk Encryption (FDE) (such as whether the LVs are encrypted, which
        users have access, etc) and other services. However, at the present
        time, for the creation of any new LVFs, only zero or one LVF per LVG is
        supported.</p>
    <p class="Pp">A Logical Volume Family (LVF) exports one or more Logical
        Volumes (LVs). However, only and exactly one LV per LVF is
      supported.</p>
    <p class="Pp">A Logical Volume (LV) exports a dev node, upon which a file
        system (such as Journaled HFS+) resides.</p>
    <p class="Pp">For more information on specifying device arguments, see the
        <b class="Sy">DEVICES</b> section below.</p>

          <b class="Sy">-plist</b> is specified then a property list will be

        Unlock a logical volume and file system, causing it to be attached and
          mounted. Data is then accessible in plain form to the file system and
          applications, while the on-physical-disk backing bytes remain in
          encrypted form. A credential must be supplied; you must supply either
          a &quot;Disk&quot; user passphrase or a recovery keychain file.
        <p class="Pp">If no <b class="Sy">-passphrase</b> option is specified,
            you will be prompted interactively; else, your
            <var class="Ar">passphrase</var> is used. Or, if you specify
            <b class="Sy">-stdinpassphrase</b> then the standard input is read
            (e.g. so that the passphrase can be securely piped in without having
            to expose it).</p>
        <p class="Pp">Alternatively, you can specify
            <b class="Sy">-recoverykeychain</b> with a path to a keychain
            <var class="Ar">file</var>. The keychain must be unlocked; see
            <a class="Xr">security(1)</a> for more information.</p>
        <p class="Pp">The locked state means that the CoreStorage driver has not
            been given authentication information (a passphrase) to interpret
            the encrypted bytes on disk and thus export a dev node. This verb
            unlocks a logical volume family (LVF) and its logical volumes (LVs)
            by providing that authentication; as the LVs thus appear as dev
            nodes, any file systems upon them are automatically mounted unless
            the <b class="Sy">-nomount</b> option is given.</p>
        <p class="Pp">To re-lock the volume, make it offline again by ejecting
            it, e.g. with <b class="Sy">diskutil</b>

<h1 class="Sh" id="DISK_IDENTIFIER"><a class="permalink" href="#DISK_IDENTIFIER">DISK
  IDENTIFIER</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The (BSD) <b class="Sy">disk identifier</b> string variously
    identifies a physical or logical device unit, a session (if any) upon that
    device, a partition (slice) upon that session (if any), a virtual logical
    volume, or a moment in a volume's evolution. It may take the form of
    <span class="Pa">diskU</span>, <span class="Pa">diskUsP</span>,
    <span class="Pa">diskUsQ</span>, <span class="Pa">diskUsQsP</span>,
    <span class="Pa">diskC</span>, <span class="Pa">diskCsV</span>, or
    <span class="Pa">diskCsVsS</span> where C, P, Q, S, U, and V are positive
    decimal integers (possibly multi-digit), and where:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet Bd-indent">
  <li><span class="Pa">U</span> is the device unit. It may refer to hardware
      (e.g. a hard drive, optical drive, or memory card) or a virtual
      &quot;drive&quot; constructed by software (e.g. an AppleRAID Set, Apple
      Disk Image, CoreStorage LV, etc).</li>
  <li><span class="Pa">C</span> is an APFS Container. This is a virtual disk
      constructed by APFS to represent a collection of APFS Volumes. Multiple
      APFS Containers can be active simultaneously.</li>
  <li><span class="Pa">Q</span> is the session and is only included for optical
      media; it refers to the number of times recording has taken place on the
      currently-inserted medium (disc).</li>
  <li><span class="Pa">P</span> is a partition in some partitioning scheme. A
      partitioning scheme divides up a device unit and is also called a
      &quot;partition map&quot; or simply a &quot;map&quot;. Upon a partition,
      the raw data that underlies a user-visible file system is usually present,
      but it may also contain specialized data for certain 3rd-party database
      programs, or data required for the system software (e.g. EFI partitions,
      booter partitions, APM partition map data, etc), or, notably, it might
      contain backing-store physical volumes for AppleRAID, CoreStorage, APFS,
      or other (3rd-party) Storage Systems. For example, a partition disk0s2
      might contain APFS data and have a partition type of Apple_APFS; this
      partition would then be termed an APFS Physical Store, out of which an
      APFS Container disk1 is defined, out of which an APFS Volume disk1s1 is
      exported.</li>
  <li><span class="Pa">V</span> is an APFS Volume; it refers to a virtual
      logical volume that is shared out of an APFS Container. For example,
      exported from an APFS Container designated as disk1 there might be an APFS
      Volume disk1s1, mountable as a file system and usable for file storage via
      its mountpoint path.</li>
  <li><span class="Pa">S</span> is an APFS Snapshot; it refers to a frozen
      moment in time of the state of files on an APFS Volume. For example, if
      APFS Container disk6 has an APFS Volume disk6s3, and two APFS Snapshots
      have been &quot;taken&quot; on it, these, when mounted, might be
      designated as disk6s3s1 and disk6s3s2. Zero or more snapshots can be
      persistently defined on a volume, but only &quot;active&quot; (mounted)
      snapshots have disk identifiers.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">Some units (e.g. floppy disks, RAID sets) contain file system data
    upon their &quot;whole&quot; device instead of containing a partitioning
    scheme with partitions.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that some of the forms appear the same and must be
    distinguished by context. For example, <span class="Pa">diskUsQ</span>,
    <span class="Pa">diskUsS</span>, and <span class="Pa">diskCsV</span> are all
    2-part forms that can mean different things: For non-optical media, it
    identifies a partition (on a partition map) upon which (file system) data is
    stored; for optical media, it identifies a session upon which an entire
    partition map (with its partitions with file systems) is stored; for an APFS
    setup, it identifies an APFS Volume. As another example, in
    &quot;stacked&quot; cases (CoreStorage on AppleRAID or APFS on AppleRAID),
    the 1-part <span class="Pa">diskU</span> form becomes a CoreStorage PV or
    APFS PhysicalStore, in contrast with the more-common 2-part form.</p>
<p class="Pp">It is important for software to avoid relying on numerical
    ordering of any of the parts. Activities including but not limited to
    partition deletions and insertions, partition resizing, virtual volume
    deletions and additions, device ejects and attachments due to media
    insertion cycles, plug cycles, authentication lock cycles or reboots, can
    all cause (temporary) gaps and non-increments in the numerical ordering of
    any of the parts. You must rely on more persistent means of identification,
    such as the various UUIDs.</p>

<p class="Pp">The eraseDisk and partitionDisk verbs had an option to add Mac OS
    9 drivers (in partitions designated for that purpose); there was also a
    repairOS9Permissions verb. These have been removed.</p>
<p class="Pp">Starting with Mac OS X 10.6, the input and output notation of disk
    and partition sizes use power-of-10 suffixes. In the past this had been
    power-of-2, regardless of the suffix (e.g. G, Gi, GiB) used for display or
    accepted as input. Starting with Mac OS X 10.11, the <b class="Sy">B</b>
    suffix is optional even for &quot;bare&quot; numeric values.</p>
<p class="Pp">Starting with Mac OS X 10.11, the verify- and repairPermissions
    verbs have been removed.</p>
<p class="Pp">Starting with macOS 10.12, the plist output of partitions from
    <b class="Sy">diskutil list -plist</b> is presented in on-disk (not BSD
    slice name, e.g. disk0s2) order. This mimics the order of outputs from
    programs such as <b class="Sy">gpt</b> (1). The human-readable output always
    has been, and remains, in on-disk order.</p>
<p class="Pp">Starting with macOS 10.13.2, APFS cryptographic user
    authentication is required even when disabling FileVault.</p>
<p class="Pp">Starting with macOS 10.14, partitions on all media above 1GiB in
    size will default to 1MiB alignment, regardless of the partitioning scheme.
    This is significant for MBR partition maps and their use in appliances such
    as cameras. Free-space requests will not be aligned.</p>
<p class="Pp">Starting with macOS 11.0, certain Core Storage manipulation verbs
    have been removed.</p>
