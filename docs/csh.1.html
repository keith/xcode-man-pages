   Style notes for the tcsh man page:
  
   - Tags in lists are bold, except in the FILES section where they are
     italic.
  
   - References are bold for section headings and environment and shell
     variables and italic for commands (externals, builtins, aliases, and
     editor commands) and arguments to commands.
  
   - Be careful with the .B and .I macros: they handle only a limited number
     of words. Work around this with \fB and \fI, but only if absolutely
     necessary, because tcsh.man2html uses .B/.I to find name anchors.
  
   - Indent in multiples of 4, usually 8.
  
   - Use `', not '' or "", except of course in shell syntax examples.
     '' at the beginning of a line will vanish!
  
   - Use \` for literal back-quote (`).
  
   - Use \e for literal backslash (\).
  
   - Use \-, not -.
  
   - Include the tilde when naming dot files. `~/.login', not `.login'.
  
   - Refer to external commands in man page format, e.g., `csh(1)'. However,
     tcsh is `tcsh', not `tcsh(1)', because this is the tcsh man page (and
     see the next note anyway).
  
   - Say `the shell', not `tcsh', unless distinguishing between tcsh and csh.
  
   - Say `shell variable'/`environment variable' instead of `variable'
     and `builtin command'/`editor command' instead of `builtin' or `command'
     unless the distinction is absolutely clear from context.
  
   - Use the simple present tense. `The shell uses', not `The shell will use'.
  
   - IMPORTANT: Cross-reference as much as possible. Commands, variables,
     etc. in the reference section should be mentioned in the appropriate
     descriptive section, or at least in the reference-section description
     of another command (or whatever) which is mentioned in a description
     section. Remember to note OS-specific things in "OS variant support",
     new features in NEW FEATURES and referenced external commands in SEE
     ALSO.
  
   - tcsh.man2html depends heavily on the specific nroff commands used in the
     man page when the script was written. Please stick closely to the style
     used here if you can. In particular, please don't use nroff commands
     which aren't already used herein.

<i>tcsh</i> is an enhanced but completely compatible version of the Berkeley
  UNIX C shell, <i>csh</i>(1). It is a command language interpreter usable both
  as an interactive login shell and a shell script command processor. It
  includes a command-line editor (see <b>The command-line editor</b>),
  programmable word completion (see <b>Completion and listing</b>), spelling
  correction (see <b>Spelling correction</b>), a history mechanism (see
  <b>History substitution</b>), job control (see <b>Jobs</b>) and a C-like
  syntax. The <b>NEW FEATURES</b> section describes major enhancements of
  <i>tcsh</i> over <i>csh</i>(1). Throughout this manual, features of
  <i>tcsh</i> not found in most <i>csh</i>(1) implementations (specifically, the
  4.4BSD <i>csh</i>) are labeled with `(+)', and features which are present in
  <i>csh</i>(1) but not usually documented are labeled with `(u)'.

  list processing</a></h2>
If the first argument (argument 0) to the shell is `-' then it is a login shell.
  A login shell can be also specified by invoking the shell with the <b>-l</b>
  flag as the only argument.
<p class="Pp">The rest of the flag arguments are interpreted as follows:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>-b</b></dt>
  <dd>Forces a ``break'' from option processing, causing any further shell
      arguments to be treated as non-option arguments. The remaining arguments
      will not be interpreted as shell options. This may be used to pass options
      to a shell script without confusion or possible subterfuge. The shell will
      not run a set-user ID script without this option.</dd>
  <dt><b>-c</b></dt>
  <dd>Commands are read from the following argument (which must be present, and
      must be a single argument), stored in the <b>command</b> shell variable

  <dt><b>-e</b></dt>
  <dd>The shell exits if any invoked command terminates abnormally or yields a
      non-zero exit status.</dd>
  <dt><b>-f</b></dt>
  <dd>The shell does not load any resource or startup files, or perform any
      command hashing, and thus starts faster.</dd>
  <dt><b>-F</b></dt>
  <dd>The shell uses <i>fork</i>(2) instead of <i>vfork</i>(2) to spawn

  <dt><b>-i</b></dt>
  <dd>The shell is interactive and prompts for its top-level input, even if it

  <dt><b>-n</b></dt>
  <dd>The shell parses commands but does not execute them. This aids in
      debugging shell scripts.</dd>

      is used under a debugger. Job control is disabled. (u)</dd>
  <dt><b>-s</b></dt>
  <dd>Command input is taken from the standard input.</dd>
  <dt><b>-t</b></dt>
  <dd>The shell reads and executes a single line of input. A `\' may be used to
      escape the newline at the end of this line and continue onto another
    line.</dd>
  <dt><b>-v</b></dt>
  <dd>Sets the <b>verbose</b> shell variable, so that command input is echoed

      immediately before execution.</dd>

  <dd>Sets the <b>verbose</b> shell variable even before executing
      <i>~/.tcshrc</i>.</dd>

<p class="Pp">After processing of flag arguments, if arguments remain but none
    of the <b>-c</b>, <b>-i</b>, <b>-s</b>, or <b>-t</b> options were given, the
    first argument is taken as the name of a file of commands, or ``script'', to
    be executed. The shell opens this file and saves its name for possible
    resubstitution by `$0'. Because many systems use either the standard version
    6 or version 7 shells whose shell scripts are not compatible with this
    shell, the shell uses such a `standard' shell to execute a script whose
    first character is not a `#', i.e., that does not start with a comment.</p>
<p class="Pp">Remaining arguments are placed in the <b>argv</b> shell
  variable.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Startup_and_shutdown"><a class="permalink" href="#Startup_and_shutdown">Startup
  and shutdown</a></h2>
A login shell begins by executing commands from the system files
  <i>/etc/csh.cshrc</i> and <i>/etc/csh.login</i>. It then executes commands
  from files in the user's <b>home</b> directory: first <i>~/.tcshrc</i> (+) or,
  if <i>~/.tcshrc</i> is not found, <i>~/.cshrc</i>, then the contents of
  <i>~/.history</i> (or the value of the <b>histfile</b> shell variable) are
  loaded into memory, then <i>~/.login</i>, and finally <i>~/.cshdirs</i> (or
  the value of the <b>dirsfile</b> shell variable) (+). The shell may read
  <i>/etc/csh.login</i> before instead of after <i>/etc/csh.cshrc</i>, and
  <i>~/.login</i> before instead of after <i>~/.tcshrc</i> or <i>~/.cshrc</i>
  and <i>~/.history</i>, if so compiled; see the <b>version</b> shell variable.
  (+)
<p class="Pp">Non-login shells read only <i>/etc/csh.cshrc</i> and
    <i>~/.tcshrc</i> or <i>~/.cshrc</i> on startup.</p>
<p class="Pp">For examples of startup files, please consult
    <i>http://tcshrc.sourceforge.net</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Commands like <i>stty</i>(1) and <i>tset</i>(1), which need be run
    only once per login, usually go in one's <i>~/.login</i> file. Users who
    need to use the same set of files with both <i>csh</i>(1) and <i>tcsh</i>
    can have only a <i>~/.cshrc</i> which checks for the existence of the
    <b>tcsh</b> shell variable (q.v.) before using <i>tcsh</i>-specific
    commands, or can have both a <i>~/.cshrc</i> and a <i>~/.tcshrc</i> which
    <i>source</i>s (see the builtin command) <i>~/.cshrc</i>. The rest of this
    manual uses `<i>~/.tcshrc</i>' to mean `<i>~/.tcshrc</i> or, if
    <i>~/.tcshrc</i> is not found, <i>~/.cshrc</i>'.</p>
<p class="Pp">In the normal case, the shell begins reading commands from the
    terminal, prompting with `&gt; '. (Processing of arguments and the use of
    the shell to process files containing command scripts are described later.)
    The shell repeatedly reads a line of command input, breaks it into words,
    places it on the command history list, parses it and executes each command
    in the line.</p>
<p class="Pp">One can log out by typing `^D' on an empty line, `logout' or
    `login' or via the shell's autologout mechanism (see the <b>autologout</b>
    shell variable). When a login shell terminates it sets the <b>logout</b>
    shell variable to `normal' or `automatic' as appropriate, then executes
    commands from the files <i>/etc/csh.logout</i> and <i>~/.logout</i>. The
    shell may drop DTR on logout if so compiled; see the <b>version</b> shell
    variable.</p>
<p class="Pp">The names of the system login and logout files vary from system to
    system for compatibility with different <i>csh</i>(1) variants; see
    <b>FILES</b>.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Editing"><a class="permalink" href="#Editing">Editing</a></h2>
We first describe <b>The command-line editor</b>. The <b>Completion and
  listing</b> and <b>Spelling correction</b> sections describe two sets of
  functionality that are implemented as editor commands but which deserve their
  own treatment. Finally, <b>Editor commands</b> lists and describes the editor
  commands specific to the shell and their default bindings.
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="The_command-line_editor_(+)"><a class="permalink" href="#The_command-line_editor_(+)">The
  command-line editor (+)</a></h2>
Command-line input can be edited using key sequences much like those used in
  <i>emacs</i>(1) or <i>vi</i>(1). The editor is active only when the
  <b>edit</b> shell variable is set, which it is by default in interactive
  shells. The <i>bindkey</i> builtin can display and change key bindings.
  <i>emacs</i>(1)-style key bindings are used by default (unless the shell was
  compiled otherwise; see the <b>version</b> shell variable), but <i>bindkey</i>
  can change the key bindings to <i>vi</i>(1)-style bindings en masse.
<p class="Pp">The shell always binds the arrow keys (as defined in the
    <b>TERMCAP</b> environment variable) to</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>down</dt>
  <dd><i>down-history</i></dd>
  <dt>up</dt>
  <dd><i>up-history</i></dd>
  <dt>left</dt>
  <dd><i>backward-char</i></dd>
  <dt>right</dt>
  <dd><i>forward-char</i></dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p class="Pp">unless doing so would alter another single-character binding. One
    can set the arrow key escape sequences to the empty string with <i>settc</i>
    to prevent these bindings. The ANSI/VT100 sequences for arrow keys are
    always bound.</p>
<p class="Pp">Other key bindings are, for the most part, what <i>emacs</i>(1)
    and <i>vi</i>(1) users would expect and can easily be displayed by
    <i>bindkey</i>, so there is no need to list them here. Likewise,
    <i>bindkey</i> can list the editor commands with a short description of
    each. Certain key bindings have different behavior depending if
    <i>emacs</i>(1) or <i>vi</i>(1) style bindings are being used; see
    <b>vimode</b> for more information.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that editor commands do not have the same notion of a
    ``word'' as does the shell. The editor delimits words with any
    non-alphanumeric characters not in the shell variable <b>wordchars</b>,
    while the shell recognizes only whitespace and some of the characters with
    special meanings to it, listed under <b>Lexical structure</b>.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Completion_and_listing_(+)"><a class="permalink" href="#Completion_and_listing_(+)">Completion
  and listing (+)</a></h2>
The shell is often able to complete words when given a unique abbreviation. Type
  part of a word (for example `ls /usr/lost') and hit the tab key to run the
  <i>complete-word</i> editor command. The shell completes the filename
  `/usr/lost' to `/usr/lost+found/', replacing the incomplete word with the
  complete word in the input buffer. (Note the terminal `/'; completion adds a
  `/' to the end of completed directories and a space to the end of other
  completed words, to speed typing and provide a visual indicator of successful
  completion. The <b>addsuffix</b> shell variable can be unset to prevent this.)
  If no match is found (perhaps `/usr/lost+found' doesn't exist), the terminal
  bell rings. If the word is already complete (perhaps there is a `/usr/lost' on
  your system, or perhaps you were thinking too far ahead and typed the whole
  thing) a `/' or space is added to the end if it isn't already there.
<p class="Pp">Completion works anywhere in the line, not at just the end;
    completed text pushes the rest of the line to the right. Completion in the
    middle of a word often results in leftover characters to the right of the
    cursor that need to be deleted.</p>
<p class="Pp">Commands and variables can be completed in much the same way. For
    example, typing `em[tab]' would complete `em' to `emacs' if <i>emacs</i>
    were the only command on your system beginning with `em'. Completion can
    find a command in any directory in <b>path</b> or if given a full pathname.
    Typing `echo $ar[tab]' would complete `$ar' to `$argv' if no other variable
    began with `ar'.</p>
<p class="Pp">The shell parses the input buffer to determine whether the word
    you want to complete should be completed as a filename, command or variable.
    The first word in the buffer and the first word following `;', `|',
    `|&amp;', `&amp;&amp;' or `||' is considered to be a command. A word
    beginning with `$' is considered to be a variable. Anything else is a
    filename. An empty line is `completed' as a filename.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can list the possible completions of a word at any time by
    typing `^D' to run the <i>delete-char-or-list-or-eof</i> editor command. The
    shell lists the possible completions using the <i>ls-F</i> builtin (q.v.)
    and reprints the prompt and unfinished command line, for example:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>
  </dt>
  <dd>&gt; ls /usr/l[^D]
    <br/>
    lbin/ lib/ local/ lost+found/
    <br/>
    &gt; ls /usr/l</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">If the <b>autolist</b> shell variable is set, the shell lists the
    remaining choices (if any) whenever completion fails:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>
  </dt>
  <dd>&gt; set autolist
    <br/>
    &gt; nm /usr/lib/libt[tab]
    <br/>
    libtermcap.a@ libtermlib.a@
    <br/>
    &gt; nm /usr/lib/libterm</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">If <b>autolist</b> is set to `ambiguous', choices are listed only
    when completion fails and adds no new characters to the word being
    completed.</p>
<p class="Pp">A filename to be completed can contain variables, your own or
    others' home directories abbreviated with `~' (see <b>Filename
    substitution</b>) and directory stack entries abbreviated with `=' (see
    <b>Directory stack substitution</b>). For example,</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>
  </dt>
  <dd>&gt; ls ~k[^D]
    <br/>
    kahn kas kellogg
    <br/>
    &gt; ls ~ke[tab]
    <br/>
    &gt; ls ~kellogg/</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">or</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>
  </dt>
  <dd>&gt; set local = /usr/local
    <br/>
    &gt; ls $lo[tab]
    <br/>
    &gt; ls $local/[^D]
    <br/>
    bin/ etc/ lib/ man/ src/
    <br/>
    &gt; ls $local/</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Note that variables can also be expanded explicitly with the
    <i>expand-variables</i> editor command.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>delete-char-or-list-or-eof</i> lists at only the end of the
    line; in the middle of a line it deletes the character under the cursor and
    on an empty line it logs one out or, if <b>ignoreeof</b> is set, does
    nothing. `M-^D', bound to the editor command <i>list-choices</i>, lists
    completion possibilities anywhere on a line, and <i>list-choices</i> (or any
    one of the related editor commands that do or don't delete, list and/or log
    out, listed under <i>delete-char-or-list-or-eof</i>) can be bound to `^D'
    with the <i>bindkey</i> builtin command if so desired.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>complete-word-fwd</i> and <i>complete-word-back</i> editor
    commands (not bound to any keys by default) can be used to cycle up and down
    through the list of possible completions, replacing the current word with
    the next or previous word in the list.</p>
<p class="Pp">The shell variable <b>fignore</b> can be set to a list of suffixes
    to be ignored by completion. Consider the following:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>
  </dt>
  <dd>&gt; ls
    <br/>
    Makefile condiments.h~ main.o side.c
    <br/>
    README main.c meal side.o
    <br/>
    condiments.h main.c~
    <br/>
    &gt; set fignore = (.o \~)
    <br/>
    &gt; emacs ma[^D]
    <br/>
    main.c main.c~ main.o
    <br/>
    &gt; emacs ma[tab]
    <br/>
    &gt; emacs main.c</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">`main.c~' and `main.o' are ignored by completion (but not
    listing), because they end in suffixes in <b>fignore</b>. Note that a `\'
    was needed in front of `~' to prevent it from being expanded to <b>home</b>
    as described under <b>Filename substitution</b>. <b>fignore</b> is ignored
    if only one completion is possible.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the <b>complete</b> shell variable is set to `enhance',
    completion 1) ignores case and 2) considers periods, hyphens and underscores
    (`.', `-' and `_') to be word separators and hyphens and underscores to be
    equivalent. If you had the following files</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>
  </dt>
  <dd>comp.lang.c comp.lang.perl comp.std.c++
    <br/>
    comp.lang.c++ comp.std.c</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">and typed `mail -f c.l.c[tab]', it would be completed to `mail -f
    comp.lang.c', and ^D would list `comp.lang.c' and `comp.lang.c++'. `mail -f
    c..c++[^D]' would list `comp.lang.c++' and `comp.std.c++'. Typing `rm
    a--file[^D]' in the following directory</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>
  </dt>
  <dd>A_silly_file a-hyphenated-file another_silly_file</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">would list all three files, because case is ignored and hyphens
    and underscores are equivalent. Periods, however, are not equivalent to
    hyphens or underscores.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the <b>complete</b> shell variable is set to `Enhance',
    completion ignores case and differences between a hyphen and an underscore
    word separator only when the user types a lowercase character or a hyphen.
    Entering an uppercase character or an underscore will not match the
    corresponding lowercase character or hyphen word separator. Typing `rm
    a--file[^D]' in the directory of the previous example would still list all
    three files, but typing `rm A--file' would match only `A_silly_file' and
    typing `rm a__file[^D]' would match just `A_silly_file' and
    `another_silly_file' because the user explicitly used an uppercase or an
    underscore character.</p>
<p class="Pp">Completion and listing are affected by several other shell
    variables: <b>recexact</b> can be set to complete on the shortest possible
    unique match, even if more typing might result in a longer match:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>
  </dt>
  <dd>&gt; ls
    <br/>
    fodder foo food foonly
    <br/>
    &gt; set recexact
    <br/>
    &gt; rm fo[tab]</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">just beeps, because `fo' could expand to `fod' or `foo', but if we
    type another `o',</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>
  </dt>
  <dd>&gt; rm foo[tab]
    <br/>
    &gt; rm foo</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">the completion completes on `foo', even though `food' and `foonly'
    also match. <b>autoexpand</b> can be set to run the <i>expand-history</i>
    editor command before each completion attempt, <b>autocorrect</b> can be set
    to spelling-correct the word to be completed (see <b>Spelling
    correction</b>) before each completion attempt and <b>correct</b> can be set
    to complete commands automatically after one hits `return'. <b>matchbeep</b>
    can be set to make completion beep or not beep in a variety of situations,
    and <b>nobeep</b> can be set to never beep at all. <b>nostat</b> can be set
    to a list of directories and/or patterns that match directories to prevent
    the completion mechanism from <i>stat</i>(2)ing those directories.
    <b>listmax</b> and <b>listmaxrows</b> can be set to limit the number of
    items and rows (respectively) that are listed without asking first.
    <b>recognize_only_executables</b> can be set to make the shell list only
    executables when listing commands, but it is quite slow.</p>
<p class="Pp">Finally, the <i>complete</i> builtin command can be used to tell
    the shell how to complete words other than filenames, commands and
    variables. Completion and listing do not work on glob-patterns (see
    <b>Filename substitution</b>), but the <i>list-glob</i> and
    <i>expand-glob</i> editor commands perform equivalent functions for
    glob-patterns.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Spelling_correction_(+)"><a class="permalink" href="#Spelling_correction_(+)">Spelling
  correction (+)</a></h2>
The shell can sometimes correct the spelling of filenames, commands and variable
  names as well as completing and listing them.
<p class="Pp">Individual words can be spelling-corrected with the
    <i>spell-word</i> editor command (usually bound to M-s and M-S) and the
    entire input buffer with <i>spell-line</i> (usually bound to M-$). The
    <b>correct</b> shell variable can be set to `cmd' to correct the command
    name or `all' to correct the entire line each time return is typed, and
    <b>autocorrect</b> can be set to correct the word to be completed before
    each completion attempt.</p>
<p class="Pp">When spelling correction is invoked in any of these ways and the
    shell thinks that any part of the command line is misspelled, it prompts
    with the corrected line:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>
  </dt>
  <dd>&gt; set correct = cmd
    <br/>
    &gt; lz /usr/bin
    <br/>
    CORRECT&gt;ls /usr/bin (y|n|e|a)?</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">One can answer `y' or space to execute the corrected line, `e' to
    leave the uncorrected command in the input buffer, `a' to abort the command
    as if `^C' had been hit, and anything else to execute the original line
    unchanged.</p>
<p class="Pp">Spelling correction recognizes user-defined completions (see the
    <i>complete</i> builtin command). If an input word in a position for which a
    completion is defined resembles a word in the completion list, spelling
    correction registers a misspelling and suggests the latter word as a
    correction. However, if the input word does not match any of the possible
    completions for that position, spelling correction does not register a
    misspelling.</p>
<p class="Pp">Like completion, spelling correction works anywhere in the line,
    pushing the rest of the line to the right and possibly leaving extra
    characters to the right of the cursor.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Lexical_structure"><a class="permalink" href="#Lexical_structure">Lexical
  structure</a></h2>
The shell splits input lines into words at blanks and tabs. The special
  characters `&amp;', `|', `;', `&lt;', `&gt;', `(', and `)' and the doubled
  characters `&amp;&amp;', `||', `&lt;&lt;' and `&gt;&gt;' are always separate
  words, whether or not they are surrounded by whitespace.
<p class="Pp">When the shell's input is not a terminal, the character `#' is
    taken to begin a comment. Each `#' and the rest of the input line on which
    it appears is discarded before further parsing.</p>
<p class="Pp">A special character (including a blank or tab) may be prevented
    from having its special meaning, and possibly made part of another word, by
    preceding it with a backslash (`\') or enclosing it in single (`''), double
    (`&quot;') or backward (``') quotes. When not otherwise quoted a newline
    preceded by a `\' is equivalent to a blank, but inside quotes this sequence
    results in a newline.</p>
<p class="Pp">Furthermore, all <b>Substitutions</b> (see below) except
    <b>History substitution</b> can be prevented by enclosing the strings (or
    parts of strings) in which they appear with single quotes or by quoting the
    crucial character(s) (e.g., `$' or ``' for <b>Variable substitution</b> or
    <b>Command substitution</b> respectively) with `\'. (<b>Alias
    substitution</b> is no exception: quoting in any way any character of a word
    for which an <i>alias</i> has been defined prevents substitution of the
    alias. The usual way of quoting an alias is to precede it with a backslash.)
    <b>History substitution</b> is prevented by backslashes but not by single
    quotes. Strings quoted with double or backward quotes undergo <b>Variable
    substitution</b> and <b>Command substitution</b>, but other substitutions
    are prevented.</p>
<p class="Pp">Text inside single or double quotes becomes a single word (or part
    of one). Metacharacters in these strings, including blanks and tabs, do not
    form separate words. Only in one special case (see <b>Command
    substitution</b> below) can a double-quoted string yield parts of more than
    one word; single-quoted strings never do. Backward quotes are special: they
    signal <b>Command substitution</b> (q.v.), which may result in more than one
    word.</p>
<p class="Pp">Quoting complex strings, particularly strings which themselves
    contain quoting characters, can be confusing. Remember that quotes need not
    be used as they are in human writing! It may be easier to quote not an
    entire string, but only those parts of the string which need quoting, using
    different types of quoting to do so if appropriate.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>backslash_quote</b> shell variable (q.v.) can be set to
    make backslashes always quote `\', `'', and `&quot;'. (+) This may make
    complex quoting tasks easier, but it can cause syntax errors in
    <i>csh</i>(1) scripts.</p>

We now describe the various transformations the shell performs on the input in
  the order in which they occur. We note in passing the data structures involved
  and the commands and variables which affect them. Remember that substitutions
  can be prevented by quoting as described under <b>Lexical structure</b>.

<h2 class="Ss" id="History_substitution"><a class="permalink" href="#History_substitution">History
  substitution</a></h2>
Each command, or ``event'', input from the terminal is saved in the history
  list. The previous command is always saved, and the <b>history</b> shell
  variable can be set to a number to save that many commands. The <b>histdup</b>
  shell variable can be set to not save duplicate events or consecutive
  duplicate events.
<p class="Pp">Saved commands are numbered sequentially from 1 and stamped with
    the time. It is not usually necessary to use event numbers, but the current
    event number can be made part of the prompt by placing an `!' in the
    <b>prompt</b> shell variable.</p>
<p class="Pp">The shell actually saves history in expanded and literal
    (unexpanded) forms. If the <b>histlit</b> shell variable is set, commands
    that display and store history use the literal form.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>history</i> builtin command can print, store in a file,
    restore and clear the history list at any time, and the <b>savehist</b> and
    <b>histfile</b> shell variables can be set to store the history list
    automatically on logout and restore it on login.</p>
<p class="Pp">History substitutions introduce words from the history list into
    the input stream, making it easy to repeat commands, repeat arguments of a
    previous command in the current command, or fix spelling mistakes in the
    previous command with little typing and a high degree of confidence.</p>
<p class="Pp">History substitutions begin with the character `!'. They may begin
    anywhere in the input stream, but they do not nest. The `!' may be preceded
    by a `\' to prevent its special meaning; for convenience, a `!' is passed
    unchanged when it is followed by a blank, tab, newline, `=' or `('. History
    substitutions also occur when an input line begins with `^'. This special
    abbreviation will be described later. The characters used to signal history
    substitution (`!' and `^') can be changed by setting the <b>histchars</b>
    shell variable. Any input line which contains a history substitution is
    printed before it is executed.</p>
<p class="Pp">A history substitution may have an ``event specification'', which
    indicates the event from which words are to be taken, a ``word designator'',
    which selects particular words from the chosen event, and/or a ``modifier'',
    which manipulates the selected words.</p>

  <dd>The most recent event which contains the string <i>s</i>. The second `?'
      can be omitted if it is immediately followed by a newline.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p class="Pp">For example, consider this bit of someone's history list:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>
  </dt>
  <dd>&#x00A0;9 8:30 nroff -man wumpus.man
    <br/>
    10 8:31 cp wumpus.man wumpus.man.old
    <br/>
    11 8:36 vi wumpus.man
    <br/>
    12 8:37 diff wumpus.man.old wumpus.man</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The commands are shown with their event numbers and time stamps.
    The current event, which we haven't typed in yet, is event 13. `!11' and
    `!-2' refer to event 11. `!!' refers to the previous event, 12. `!!' can be
    abbreviated `!' if it is followed by `:' (`:' is described below). `!n'
    refers to event 9, which begins with `n'. `!?old?' also refers to event 12,
    which contains `old'. Without word designators or modifiers history
    references simply expand to the entire event, so we might type `!cp' to redo
    the copy command or `!!|more' if the `diff' output scrolled off the top of
    the screen.</p>
<p class="Pp">History references may be insulated from the surrounding text with
    braces if necessary. For example, `!vdoc' would look for a command beginning
    with `vdoc', and, in this example, not find one, but `!{v}doc' would expand
    unambiguously to `vi wumpus.mandoc'. Even in braces, history substitutions
    do not nest.</p>
<p class="Pp">(+) While <i>csh</i>(1) expands, for example, `!3d' to event 3
    with the letter `d' appended to it, <i>tcsh</i> expands it to the last event
    beginning with `3d'; only completely numeric arguments are treated as event
    numbers. This makes it possible to recall events beginning with numbers. To
    expand `!3d' as in <i>csh</i>(1) say `!{3}d'.</p>
<p class="Pp">To select words from an event we can follow the event
    specification by a `:' and a designator for the desired words. The words of
    an input line are numbered from 0, the first (usually command) word being 0,
    the second word (first argument) being 1, etc. The basic word designators
    are:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>0</dt>
  <dd>The first (command) word</dd>
  <dt><i>n</i></dt>
  <dd>The <i>n</i>th argument</dd>
  <dt>^</dt>
  <dd>The first argument, equivalent to `1'</dd>
  <dt>$</dt>
  <dd>The last argument</dd>
  <dt>%</dt>
  <dd>The word matched by an ?<i>s</i>? search</dd>
  <dt><i>x-y</i></dt>
  <dd>A range of words</dd>
  <dt><i>-y</i></dt>
  <dd>Equivalent to <i>`0-y'</i></dd>
  <dt>*</dt>
  <dd>Equivalent to `^-$', but returns nothing if the event contains only 1
    word</dd>
  <dt><i>x*</i></dt>
  <dd>Equivalent to <i>`x-$'</i></dd>
  <dt><i>x-</i></dt>
  <dd>Equivalent to <i>`x*'</i>, but omitting the last word (`$')</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Selected words are inserted into the command line separated by
    single blanks. For example, the `diff' command in the previous example might
    have been typed as `diff !!:1.old !!:1' (using `:1' to select the first
    argument from the previous event) or `diff !-2:2 !-2:1' to select and swap
    the arguments from the `cp' command. If we didn't care about the order of
    the `diff' we might have said `diff !-2:1-2' or simply `diff !-2:*'. The
    `cp' command might have been written `cp wumpus.man !#:1.old', using `#' to
    refer to the current event. `!n:- hurkle.man' would reuse the first two
    words from the `nroff' command to say `nroff -man hurkle.man'.</p>
<p class="Pp">The `:' separating the event specification from the word
    designator can be omitted if the argument selector begins with a `^', `$',
    `*', `%' or `-'. For example, our `diff' command might have been `diff
    !!^.old !!^' or, equivalently, `diff !!$.old !!$'. However, if `!!' is
    abbreviated `!', an argument selector beginning with `-' will be interpreted
    as an event specification.</p>
<p class="Pp">A history reference may have a word designator but no event
    specification. It then references the previous command. Continuing our
    `diff' example, we could have said simply `diff !^.old !^' or, to get the
    arguments in the opposite order, just `diff !*'.</p>
<p class="Pp">The word or words in a history reference can be edited, or
    ``modified'', by following it with one or more modifiers, each preceded by a
    `:':</p>

      character `&amp;' in the <i>r</i> is replaced by <i>l</i>; `\' also quotes
      `&amp;'. If <i>l</i> is empty (``''), the <i>l</i> from a previous
      substitution or the <i>s</i> from a previous search or event number in

</div>
<p class="Pp">Modifiers are applied to only the first modifiable word (unless
    `g' is used). It is an error for no word to be modifiable.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, the `diff' command might have been written as `diff
    wumpus.man.old !#^:r', using `:r' to remove `.old' from the first argument
    on the same line (`!#^'). We could say `echo hello out there', then `echo
    !*:u' to capitalize `hello', `echo !*:au' to say it out loud, or `echo
    !*:agu' to really shout. We might follow `mail -s &quot;I forgot my
    password&quot; rot' with `!:s/rot/root' to correct the spelling of `root'
    (but see <b>Spelling correction</b> for a different approach).</p>
<p class="Pp">There is a special abbreviation for substitutions. `^', when it is
    the first character on an input line, is equivalent to `!:s^'. Thus we might
    have said `^rot^root' to make the spelling correction in the previous
    example. This is the only history substitution which does not explicitly
    begin with `!'.</p>
<p class="Pp">(+) In <i>csh</i> as such, only one modifier may be applied to
    each history or variable expansion. In <i>tcsh</i>, more than one may be
    used, for example</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>

  <dd>% mv wumpus.man /usr/man/man1/wumpus.1

    % man !$:t:r

    man wumpus</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">In <i>csh</i>, the result would be `wumpus.1:r'. A substitution
    followed by a colon may need to be insulated from it with braces:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>
  </dt>
  <dd>&gt; mv a.out /usr/games/wumpus
    <br/>
    &gt; setenv PATH !$:h:$PATH

    Bad ! modifier: $.
    <br/>
    &gt; setenv PATH !{-2$:h}:$PATH
    <br/>
    setenv PATH /usr/games:/bin:/usr/bin:.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The first attempt would succeed in <i>csh</i> but fails in
    <i>tcsh</i>, because <i>tcsh</i> expects another modifier after the second
    colon rather than `$'.</p>
<p class="Pp">Finally, history can be accessed through the editor as well as
    through the substitutions just described. The <i>up-</i> and
    <i>down-history</i>, <i>history-search-backward</i> and <i>-forward</i>,
    <i>i-search-back</i> and <i>-fwd</i>, <i>vi-search-back</i> and <i>-fwd</i>,
    <i>copy-prev-word</i> and <i>insert-last-word</i> editor commands search for
    events in the history list and copy them into the input buffer. The
    <i>toggle-literal-history</i> editor command switches between the expanded
    and literal forms of history lines in the input buffer.
    <i>expand-history</i> and <i>expand-line</i> expand history substitutions in
    the current word and in the entire input buffer respectively.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Alias_substitution"><a class="permalink" href="#Alias_substitution">Alias
  substitution</a></h2>
The shell maintains a list of aliases which can be set, unset and printed by the
  <i>alias</i> and <i>unalias</i> commands. After a command line is parsed into
  simple commands (see <b>Commands</b>) the first word of each command,
  left-to-right, is checked to see if it has an alias. If so, the first word is
  replaced by the alias. If the alias contains a history reference, it undergoes
  <b>History substitution</b> (q.v.) as though the original command were the
  previous input line. If the alias does not contain a history reference, the
  argument list is left untouched.
<p class="Pp">Thus if the alias for `ls' were `ls -l' the command `ls /usr'
    would become `ls -l /usr', the argument list here being undisturbed. If the
    alias for `lookup' were `grep !^ /etc/passwd' then `lookup bill' would
    become `grep bill /etc/passwd'. Aliases can be used to introduce parser
    metasyntax. For example, `alias print 'pr \!* | lpr'' defines a ``command''
    (`print') which <i>pr</i>(1)s its arguments to the line printer.</p>
<p class="Pp">Alias substitution is repeated until the first word of the command
    has no alias. If an alias substitution does not change the first word (as in
    the previous example) it is flagged to prevent a loop. Other loops are
    detected and cause an error.</p>
<p class="Pp">Some aliases are referred to by the shell; see <b>Special
    aliases</b>.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Variable_substitution"><a class="permalink" href="#Variable_substitution">Variable
  substitution</a></h2>
The shell maintains a list of variables, each of which has as value a list of
  zero or more words. The values of shell variables can be displayed and changed
  with the <i>set</i> and <i>unset</i> commands. The system maintains its own
  list of ``environment'' variables. These can be displayed and changed with
  <i>printenv</i>, <i>setenv</i> and <i>unsetenv</i>.
<p class="Pp">(+) Variables may be made read-only with `set -r' (q.v.).
    Read-only variables may not be modified or unset; attempting to do so will
    cause an error. Once made read-only, a variable cannot be made writable, so
    `set -r' should be used with caution. Environment variables cannot be made
    read-only.</p>
<p class="Pp">Some variables are set by the shell or referred to by it. For
    instance, the <b>argv</b> variable is an image of the shell's argument list,
    and words of this variable's value are referred to in special ways. Some of
    the variables referred to by the shell are toggles; the shell does not care
    what their value is, only whether they are set or not. For instance, the
    <b>verbose</b> variable is a toggle which causes command input to be echoed.
    The <b>-v</b> command line option sets this variable. <b>Special shell
    variables</b> lists all variables which are referred to by the shell.</p>
<p class="Pp">Other operations treat variables numerically. The `@' command
    permits numeric calculations to be performed and the result assigned to a
    variable. Variable values are, however, always represented as (zero or more)
    strings. For the purposes of numeric operations, the null string is
    considered to be zero, and the second and subsequent words of multi-word
    values are ignored.</p>
<p class="Pp">After the input line is aliased and parsed, and before each
    command is executed, variable substitution is performed keyed by `$'
    characters. This expansion can be prevented by preceding the `$' with a `\'
    except within `&quot;'s where it <i>always</i> occurs, and within `''s where
    it <i>never</i> occurs. Strings quoted by ``' are interpreted later (see
    <b>Command substitution</b> below) so `$' substitution does not occur there
    until later, if at all. A `$' is passed unchanged if followed by a blank,
    tab, or end-of-line.</p>
<p class="Pp">Input/output redirections are recognized before variable
    expansion, and are variable expanded separately. Otherwise, the command name
    and entire argument list are expanded together. It is thus possible for the
    first (command) word (to this point) to generate more than one word, the
    first of which becomes the command name, and the rest of which become
    arguments.</p>
<p class="Pp">Unless enclosed in `&quot;' or given the `:q' modifier the results
    of variable substitution may eventually be command and filename substituted.
    Within `&quot;', a variable whose value consists of multiple words expands
    to a (portion of a) single word, with the words of the variable's value
    separated by blanks. When the `:q' modifier is applied to a substitution the
    variable will expand to multiple words with each word separated by a blank
    and quoted to prevent later command or filename substitution.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following metasequences are provided for introducing variable
    values into the shell input. Except as noted, it is an error to reference a
    variable which is not set.</p>
<p class="Pp">$<i>name</i></p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>${<i>name</i>}</dt>
  <dd>Substitutes the words of the value of variable <i>name</i>, each separated

      would otherwise be part of it. Shell variables have names consisting of
      letters and digits starting with a letter. The underscore character is
      considered a letter. If <i>name</i> is not a shell variable, but is set in
      the environment, then that value is returned (but some of the other forms
      given below are not available in this case).</dd>

      omitted it defaults to `1'. If the last member of a range is omitted it
      defaults to `$#<i>name</i>'. The <i>selector</i> `*' selects all words. It

The remaining substitutions are applied selectively to the arguments of builtin
  commands. This means that portions of expressions which are not evaluated are
  not subjected to these expansions. For commands which are not internal to the
  shell, the command name is substituted separately from the argument list. This
  occurs very late, after input-output redirection is performed, and in a child
  of the main shell.

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Command_substitution"><a class="permalink" href="#Command_substitution">Command

Command substitution is indicated by a command enclosed in ``'. The output from
  such a command is broken into separate words at blanks, tabs and newlines, and
  null words are discarded. The output is variable and command substituted and
  put in place of the original string.
<p class="Pp">Command substitutions inside double quotes (`&quot;') retain
    blanks and tabs; only newlines force new words. The single final newline
    does not force a new word in any case. It is thus possible for a command
    substitution to yield only part of a word, even if the command outputs a
    complete line.</p>
<p class="Pp">By default, the shell since version 6.12 replaces all newline and
    carriage return characters in the command by spaces. If this is switched off
    by unsetting <b>csubstnonl</b>, newlines separate commands as usual.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Filename_substitution"><a class="permalink" href="#Filename_substitution">Filename
  substitution</a></h2>
If a word contains any of the characters `*', `?', `[' or `{' or begins with the
  character `~' it is a candidate for filename substitution, also known as
  ``globbing''. This word is then regarded as a pattern (``glob-pattern''), and
  replaced with an alphabetically sorted list of file names which match the
  pattern.
<p class="Pp">In matching filenames, the character `.' at the beginning of a
    filename or immediately following a `/', as well as the character `/' must
    be matched explicitly (unless either <b>globdot</b> or <b>globstar</b> or
    both are set(+)). The character `*' matches any string of characters,
    including the null string. The character `?' matches any single character.
    The sequence `[...]' matches any one of the characters enclosed. Within
    `[...]', a pair of characters separated by `-' matches any character
    lexically between the two.</p>
<p class="Pp">(+) Some glob-patterns can be negated: The sequence `[^...]'
    matches any single character <i>not</i> specified by the characters and/or
    ranges of characters in the braces.</p>
<p class="Pp">An entire glob-pattern can also be negated with `^':</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>
  </dt>
  <dd>&gt; echo *
    <br/>
    bang crash crunch ouch
    <br/>
    &gt; echo ^cr*
    <br/>
    bang ouch</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Glob-patterns which do not use `?', `*', or `[]' or which use `{}'
    or `~' (below) are not negated correctly.</p>
<p class="Pp">The metanotation `a{b,c,d}e' is a shorthand for `abe ace ade'.
    Left-to-right order is preserved: `/usr/source/s1/{oldls,ls}.c' expands to
    `/usr/source/s1/oldls.c /usr/source/s1/ls.c'. The results of matches are
    sorted separately at a low level to preserve this order: `../{memo,*box}'
    might expand to `../memo ../box ../mbox'. (Note that `memo' was not sorted
    with the results of matching `*box'.) It is not an error when this construct
    expands to files which do not exist, but it is possible to get an error from
    a command to which the expanded list is passed. This construct may be
    nested. As a special case the words `{', `}' and `{}' are passed
    undisturbed.</p>
<p class="Pp">The character `~' at the beginning of a filename refers to home
    directories. Standing alone, i.e., `~', it expands to the invoker's home
    directory as reflected in the value of the <b>home</b> shell variable. When
    followed by a name consisting of letters, digits and `-' characters the
    shell searches for a user with that name and substitutes their home
    directory; thus `~ken' might expand to `/usr/ken' and `~ken/chmach' to
    `/usr/ken/chmach'. If the character `~' is followed by a character other
    than a letter or `/' or appears elsewhere than at the beginning of a word,
    it is left undisturbed. A command like `setenv MANPATH
    /usr/man:/usr/local/man:~/lib/man' does not, therefore, do home directory
    substitution as one might hope.</p>
<p class="Pp">It is an error for a glob-pattern containing `*', `?', `[' or `~',
    with or without `^', not to match any files. However, only one pattern in a
    list of glob-patterns must match a file (so that, e.g., `rm *.a *.c *.o'
    would fail only if there were no files in the current directory ending in
    `.a', `.c', or `.o'), and if the <b>nonomatch</b> shell variable is set a
    pattern (or list of patterns) which matches nothing is left unchanged rather
    than causing an error.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>globstar</b> shell variable can be set to allow `**' or
    `***' as a file glob pattern that matches any string of characters including
    `/', recursively traversing any existing sub-directories. For example, `ls
    **.c' will list all the .c files in the current directory tree. If used by
    itself, it will match zero or more sub-directories (e.g. `ls
    /usr/include/**/time.h' will list any file named `time.h' in the
    /usr/include directory tree; `ls /usr/include/**time.h' will match any file
    in the /usr/include directory tree ending in `time.h'; and `ls
    /usr/include/**time**.h' will match any .h file with `time' either in a
    subdirectory name or in the filename itself). To prevent problems with
    recursion, the `**' glob-pattern will not descend into a symbolic link
    containing a directory. To override this, use `***' (+)</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>noglob</b> shell variable can be set to prevent filename
    substitution, and the <i>expand-glob</i> editor command, normally bound to
    `^X-*', can be used to interactively expand individual filename
    substitutions.</p>

  and the <b>savedirs</b> and <b>dirsfile</b> shell variables can be set to
  store the directory stack automatically on logout and restore it on login. The
  <b>dirstack</b> shell variable can be examined to see the directory stack and
  set to put arbitrary directories into the directory stack.
<p class="Pp">The character `=' followed by one or more digits expands to an
    entry in the directory stack. The special case `=-' expands to the last
    directory in the stack. For example,</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>
  </dt>
  <dd>&gt; dirs -v
    <br/>
    0 /usr/bin
    <br/>
    1 /usr/spool/uucp

    2 /usr/accts/sys
    <br/>
    &gt; echo =1

    /usr/spool/uucp

    &gt; echo =0/calendar
    <br/>
    /usr/bin/calendar
    <br/>
    &gt; echo =-
    <br/>
    /usr/accts/sys</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The <b>noglob</b> and <b>nonomatch</b> shell variables and the
    <i>expand-glob</i> editor command apply to directory stack as well as
    filename substitutions.</p>

  substitutions (+)</a></h2>
There are several more transformations involving filenames, not strictly related
  to the above but mentioned here for completeness. <i>Any</i> filename may be
  expanded to a full path when the <b>symlinks</b> variable (q.v.) is set to
  `expand'. Quoting prevents this expansion, and the <i>normalize-path</i>
  editor command does it on demand. The <i>normalize-command</i> editor command
  expands commands in PATH into full paths on demand. Finally, <i>cd</i> and
  <i>pushd</i> interpret `-' as the old working directory (equivalent to the
  shell variable <b>owd</b>). This is not a substitution at all, but an
  abbreviation recognized by only those commands. Nonetheless, it too can be
  prevented by quoting.

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Commands"><a class="permalink" href="#Commands">Commands</a></h2>
The next three sections describe how the shell executes commands and deals with
  their input and output.
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Simple_commands,_pipelines_and_sequences"><a class="permalink" href="#Simple_commands,_pipelines_and_sequences">Simple
  commands, pipelines and sequences</a></h2>
A simple command is a sequence of words, the first of which specifies the
  command to be executed. A series of simple commands joined by `|' characters
  forms a pipeline. The output of each command in a pipeline is connected to the
  input of the next.
<p class="Pp">Simple commands and pipelines may be joined into sequences with
    `;', and will be executed sequentially. Commands and pipelines can also be
    joined into sequences with `||' or `&amp;&amp;', indicating, as in the C
    language, that the second is to be executed only if the first fails or
    succeeds respectively.</p>
<p class="Pp">A simple command, pipeline or sequence may be placed in
    parentheses, `()', to form a simple command, which may in turn be a
    component of a pipeline or sequence. A command, pipeline or sequence can be
    executed without waiting for it to terminate by following it with an
    `&amp;'.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Builtin_and_non-builtin_command_execution"><a class="permalink" href="#Builtin_and_non-builtin_command_execution">Builtin
  and non-builtin command execution</a></h2>
Builtin commands are executed within the shell. If any component of a pipeline
  except the last is a builtin command, the pipeline is executed in a subshell.
<p class="Pp">Parenthesized commands are always executed in a subshell.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>
  </dt>
  <dd>(cd; pwd); pwd</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">thus prints the <b>home</b> directory, leaving you where you were
    (printing this after the home directory), while</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>
  </dt>
  <dd>cd; pwd</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">leaves you in the <b>home</b> directory. Parenthesized commands
    are most often used to prevent <i>cd</i> from affecting the current
  shell.</p>
<p class="Pp">When a command to be executed is found not to be a builtin command
    the shell attempts to execute the command via <i>execve</i>(2). Each word in
    the variable <b>path</b> names a directory in which the shell will look for
    the command. If the shell is not given a <b>-f</b> option, the shell hashes
    the names in these directories into an internal table so that it will try an
    <i>execve</i>(2) in only a directory where there is a possibility that the
    command resides there. This greatly speeds command location when a large
    number of directories are present in the search path. This hashing mechanism
    is not used:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>1.</b></dt>
  <dd>If hashing is turned explicitly off via <i>unhash</i>.</dd>
  <dt><b>2.</b></dt>
  <dd>If the shell was given a <b>-f</b> argument.</dd>
  <dt><b>3.</b></dt>
  <dd>For each directory component of <b>path</b> which does not begin with a
      `/'.</dd>
  <dt><b>4.</b></dt>
  <dd>If the command contains a `/'.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">In the above four cases the shell concatenates each component of
    the path vector with the given command name to form a path name of a file
    which it then attempts to execute it. If execution is successful, the search
    stops.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the file has execute permissions but is not an executable to
    the system (i.e., it is neither an executable binary nor a script that
    specifies its interpreter), then it is assumed to be a file containing shell
    commands and a new shell is spawned to read it. The <i>shell</i> special
    alias may be set to specify an interpreter other than the shell itself.</p>
<p class="Pp">On systems which do not understand the `#!' script interpreter
    convention the shell may be compiled to emulate it; see the <b>version</b>
    shell variable. If so, the shell checks the first line of the file to see if
    it is of the form `#!<i>interpreter</i> <i>arg</i> ...'. If it is, the shell
    starts <i>interpreter</i> with the given <i>arg</i>s and feeds the file to
    it on standard input.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Input/output"><a class="permalink" href="#Input/output">Input/output</a></h2>
The standard input and standard output of a command may be redirected with the
  following syntax:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>&lt; <i>name</i></dt>
  <dd>Open file <i>name</i> (which is first variable, command and filename
      expanded) as the standard input.</dd>
  <dt>&lt;&lt; <i>word</i></dt>
  <dd>Read the shell input up to a line which is identical to <i>word</i>.
      <i>word</i> is not subjected to variable, filename or command
      substitution, and each input line is compared to <i>word</i> before any
      substitutions are done on this input line. Unless a quoting `\', `&quot;',
      `' or ``' appears in <i>word</i> variable and command substitution is
      performed on the intervening lines, allowing `\' to quote `$', `\' and
      ``'. Commands which are substituted have all blanks, tabs, and newlines
      preserved, except for the final newline which is dropped. The resultant
      text is placed in an anonymous temporary file which is given to the
      command as standard input.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">&gt; <i>name</i>
  <br/>
  &gt;! <i>name</i>
  <br/>
  &gt;&amp; <i>name</i></p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>&gt;&amp;! <i>name</i></dt>
  <dd>The file <i>name</i> is used as standard output. If the file does not
      exist then it is created; if the file exists, it is truncated, its
      previous contents being lost.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">If the shell variable <b>noclobber</b> is set, then the file must
    not exist or be a character special file (e.g., a terminal or `/dev/null')
    or an error results. This helps prevent accidental destruction of files. In
    this case the `!' forms can be used to suppress this check. If
    <b>notempty</b> is given in <b>noclobber</b>, `&gt;' is allowed on empty
    files; if <b>ask</b> is set, an interacive confirmation is presented, rather
    than an error.</p>
<p class="Pp">The forms involving `&amp;' route the diagnostic output into the
    specified file as well as the standard output. <i>name</i> is expanded in
    the same way as `&lt;' input filenames are.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">&gt;&gt; <i>name</i>
  <br/>
  &gt;&gt;&amp; <i>name</i>
  <br/>
  &gt;&gt;! <i>name</i></p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>&gt;&gt;&amp;! <i>name</i></dt>
  <dd>Like `&gt;', but appends output to the end of <i>name</i>. If the shell
      variable <b>noclobber</b> is set, then it is an error for the file
      <i>not</i> to exist, unless one of the `!' forms is given.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">A command receives the environment in which the shell was invoked
    as modified by the input-output parameters and the presence of the command
    in a pipeline. Thus, unlike some previous shells, commands run from a file
    of shell commands have no access to the text of the commands by default;
    rather they receive the original standard input of the shell. The `&lt;&lt;'
    mechanism should be used to present inline data. This permits shell command
    scripts to function as components of pipelines and allows the shell to block
    read its input. Note that the default standard input for a command run
    detached is <i>not</i> the empty file <i>/dev/null</i>, but the original
    standard input of the shell. If this is a terminal and if the process
    attempts to read from the terminal, then the process will block and the user
    will be notified (see <b>Jobs</b>).</p>
<p class="Pp">Diagnostic output may be directed through a pipe with the standard
    output. Simply use the form `|&amp;' rather than just `|'.</p>
<p class="Pp">The shell cannot presently redirect diagnostic output without also
    redirecting standard output, but `(<i>command</i> &gt; <i>output-file</i>)
    &gt;&amp; <i>error-file</i>' is often an acceptable workaround. Either
    <i>output-file</i> or <i>error-file</i> may be `/dev/tty' to send output to
    the terminal.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Features"><a class="permalink" href="#Features">Features</a></h2>
Having described how the shell accepts, parses and executes command lines, we
  now turn to a variety of its useful features.
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Control_flow"><a class="permalink" href="#Control_flow">Control
  flow</a></h2>
The shell contains a number of commands which can be used to regulate the flow
  of control in command files (shell scripts) and (in limited but useful ways)
  from terminal input. These commands all operate by forcing the shell to reread
  or skip in its input and, due to the implementation, restrict the placement of
  some of the commands.
<p class="Pp">The <i>foreach</i>, <i>switch</i>, and <i>while</i> statements, as
    well as the <i>if-then-else</i> form of the <i>if</i> statement, require
    that the major keywords appear in a single simple command on an input line
    as shown below.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the shell's input is not seekable, the shell buffers up input
    whenever a loop is being read and performs seeks in this internal buffer to
    accomplish the rereading implied by the loop. (To the extent that this
    allows, backward <i>goto</i>s will succeed on non-seekable inputs.)</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Expressions"><a class="permalink" href="#Expressions">Expressions</a></h2>
The <i>if</i>, <i>while</i> and <i>exit</i> builtin commands use expressions
  with a common syntax. The expressions can include any of the operators
  described in the next three sections. Note that the <i>@</i> builtin command
  (q.v.) has its own separate syntax.
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Logical,_arithmetical_and_comparison_operators"><a class="permalink" href="#Logical,_arithmetical_and_comparison_operators">Logical,
  arithmetical and comparison operators</a></h2>
These operators are similar to those of C and have the same precedence. They
  include
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>
  </dt>
  <dd>|| &amp;&amp; | ^ &amp; == != =~ !~ &lt;= &gt;=
    <br/>
    &lt; &gt; &lt;&lt; &gt;&gt; + - * / % ! ~ ( )</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Here the precedence increases to the right, `==' `!=' `=~' and
    `!~', `&lt;=' `&gt;=' `&lt;' and `&gt;', `&lt;&lt;' and `&gt;&gt;', `+' and
    `-', `*' `/' and `%' being, in groups, at the same level. The `==' `!=' `=~'
    and `!~' operators compare their arguments as strings; all others operate on
    numbers. The operators `=~' and `!~' are like `!=' and `==' except that the
    right hand side is a glob-pattern (see <b>Filename substitution</b>) against
    which the left hand operand is matched. This reduces the need for use of the
    <i>switch</i> builtin command in shell scripts when all that is really
    needed is pattern matching.</p>
<p class="Pp">Null or missing arguments are considered `0'. The results of all
    expressions are strings, which represent decimal numbers. It is important to
    note that no two components of an expression can appear in the same word;
    except when adjacent to components of expressions which are syntactically
    significant to the parser (`&amp;' `|' `&lt;' `&gt;' `(' `)') they should be
    surrounded by spaces.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Command_exit_status"><a class="permalink" href="#Command_exit_status">Command
  exit status</a></h2>
Commands can be executed in expressions and their exit status returned by
  enclosing them in braces (`{}'). Remember that the braces should be separated
  from the words of the command by spaces. Command executions succeed, returning
  true, i.e., `1', if the command exits with status 0, otherwise they fail,
  returning false, i.e., `0'. If more detailed status information is required
  then the command should be executed outside of an expression and the
  <b>status</b> shell variable examined.

</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Jobs"><a class="permalink" href="#Jobs">Jobs</a></h2>
The shell associates a <i>job</i> with each pipeline. It keeps a table of
  current jobs, printed by the <i>jobs</i> command, and assigns them small
  integer numbers. When a job is started asynchronously with `&amp;', the shell
  prints a line which looks like
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>
  </dt>
  <dd>[1] 1234</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">indicating that the job which was started asynchronously was job
    number 1 and had one (top-level) process, whose process id was 1234.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you are running a job and wish to do something else you may hit
    the suspend key (usually `^Z'), which sends a STOP signal to the current
    job. The shell will then normally indicate that the job has been `Suspended'
    and print another prompt. If the <b>listjobs</b> shell variable is set, all
    jobs will be listed like the <i>jobs</i> builtin command; if it is set to
    `long' the listing will be in long format, like `jobs -l'. You can then
    manipulate the state of the suspended job. You can put it in the
    ``background'' with the <i>bg</i> command or run some other commands and
    eventually bring the job back into the ``foreground'' with <i>fg</i>. (See
    also the <i>run-fg-editor</i> editor command.) A `^Z' takes effect
    immediately and is like an interrupt in that pending output and unread input
    are discarded when it is typed. The <i>wait</i> builtin command causes the
    shell to wait for all background jobs to complete.</p>
<p class="Pp">The `^]' key sends a delayed suspend signal, which does not
    generate a STOP signal until a program attempts to <i>read</i>(2) it, to the
    current job. This can usefully be typed ahead when you have prepared some
    commands for a job which you wish to stop after it has read them. The `^Y'
    key performs this function in <i>csh</i>(1); in <i>tcsh</i>, `^Y' is an
    editing command. (+)</p>
<p class="Pp">A job being run in the background stops if it tries to read from
    the terminal. Background jobs are normally allowed to produce output, but
    this can be disabled by giving the command `stty tostop'. If you set this
    tty option, then background jobs will stop when they try to produce output
    like they do when they try to read input.</p>
<p class="Pp">There are several ways to refer to jobs in the shell. The
    character `%' introduces a job name. If you wish to refer to job number 1,
    you can name it as `%1'. Just naming a job brings it to the foreground; thus
    `%1' is a synonym for `fg %1', bringing job 1 back into the foreground.
    Similarly, saying `%1 &amp;' resumes job 1 in the background, just like `bg
    %1'. A job can also be named by an unambiguous prefix of the string typed in
    to start it: `%ex' would normally restart a suspended <i>ex</i>(1) job, if
    there were only one suspended job whose name began with the string `ex'. It
    is also possible to say `%?<i>string</i>' to specify a job whose text
    contains <i>string</i>, if there is only one such job.</p>
<p class="Pp">The shell maintains a notion of the current and previous jobs. In
    output pertaining to jobs, the current job is marked with a `+' and the
    previous job with a `-'. The abbreviations `%+', `%', and (by analogy with
    the syntax of the <i>history</i> mechanism) `%%' all refer to the current
    job, and `%-' refers to the previous job.</p>
<p class="Pp">The job control mechanism requires that the <i>stty</i>(1) option
    `new' be set on some systems. It is an artifact from a `new' implementation
    of the tty driver which allows generation of interrupt characters from the
    keyboard to tell jobs to stop. See <i>stty</i>(1) and the <i>setty</i>
    builtin command for details on setting options in the new tty driver.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Status_reporting"><a class="permalink" href="#Status_reporting">Status
  reporting</a></h2>
The shell learns immediately whenever a process changes state. It normally
  informs you whenever a job becomes blocked so that no further progress is
  possible, but only right before it prints a prompt. This is done so that it
  does not otherwise disturb your work. If, however, you set the shell variable
  <b>notify</b>, the shell will notify you immediately of changes of status in
  background jobs. There is also a shell command <i>notify</i> which marks a
  single process so that its status changes will be immediately reported. By
  default <i>notify</i> marks the current process; simply say `notify' after
  starting a background job to mark it.

There are various ways to run commands and take other actions automatically at
  various times in the ``life cycle'' of the shell. They are summarized here,
  and described in detail under the appropriate <b>Builtin commands</b>,
  <b>Special shell variables</b> and <b>Special aliases</b>.
<p class="Pp">The <i>sched</i> builtin command puts commands in a
    scheduled-event list, to be executed by the shell at a given time.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>beepcmd</i>, <i>cwdcmd</i>, <i>periodic</i>, <i>precmd</i>,
    <i>postcmd</i>, and <i>jobcmd</i> <b>Special aliases</b> can be set,
    respectively, to execute commands when the shell wants to ring the bell,
    when the working directory changes, every <b>tperiod</b> minutes, before
    each prompt, before each command gets executed, after each command gets
    executed, and when a job is started or is brought into the foreground.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>autologout</b> shell variable can be set to log out or lock
    the shell after a given number of minutes of inactivity.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>mail</b> shell variable can be set to check for new mail
    periodically.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>printexitvalue</b> shell variable can be set to print the
    exit status of commands which exit with a status other than zero.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>rmstar</b> shell variable can be set to ask the user, when
    `rm *' is typed, if that is really what was meant.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>time</b> shell variable can be set to execute the
    <i>time</i> builtin command after the completion of any process that takes
    more than a given number of CPU seconds.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>watch</b> and <b>who</b> shell variables can be set to
    report when selected users log in or out, and the <i>log</i> builtin command
    reports on those users at any time.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Native_Language_System_support_(+)"><a class="permalink" href="#Native_Language_System_support_(+)">Native
  Language System support (+)</a></h2>
The shell is eight bit clean (if so compiled; see the <b>version</b> shell
  variable) and thus supports character sets needing this capability. NLS
  support differs depending on whether or not the shell was compiled to use the
  system's NLS (again, see <b>version</b>). In either case, 7-bit ASCII is the
  default character code (e.g., the classification of which characters are
  printable) and sorting, and changing the <b>LANG</b> or <b>LC_CTYPE</b>
  environment variables causes a check for possible changes in these respects.
<p class="Pp">When using the system's NLS, the <i>setlocale</i>(3) function is
    called to determine appropriate character code/classification and sorting
    (e.g., a 'en_CA.UTF-8' would yield &quot;UTF-8&quot; as a character code).
    This function typically examines the <b>LANG</b> and <b>LC_CTYPE</b>
    environment variables; refer to the system documentation for further
    details. When not using the system's NLS, the shell simulates it by assuming
    that the ISO 8859-1 character set is used whenever either of the <b>LANG</b>
    and <b>LC_CTYPE</b> variables are set, regardless of their values. Sorting
    is not affected for the simulated NLS.</p>
<p class="Pp">In addition, with both real and simulated NLS, all printable
    characters in the range \200-\377, i.e., those that have M-<i>char</i>
    bindings, are automatically rebound to <i>self-insert-command</i>. The
    corresponding binding for the escape-<i>char</i> sequence, if any, is left
    alone. These characters are not rebound if the <b>NOREBIND</b> environment
    variable is set. This may be useful for the simulated NLS or a primitive
    real NLS which assumes full ISO 8859-1. Otherwise, all M-<i>char</i>
    bindings in the range \240-\377 are effectively undone. Explicitly rebinding
    the relevant keys with <i>bindkey</i> is of course still possible.</p>
<p class="Pp">Unknown characters (i.e., those that are neither printable nor
    control characters) are printed in the format \nnn. If the tty is not in 8
    bit mode, other 8 bit characters are printed by converting them to ASCII and
    using standout mode. The shell never changes the 7/8 bit mode of the tty and
    tracks user-initiated changes of 7/8 bit mode. NLS users (or, for that
    matter, those who want to use a meta key) may need to explicitly set the tty
    in 8 bit mode through the appropriate <i>stty</i>(1) command in, e.g., the
    <i>~/.login</i> file.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="OS_variant_support_(+)"><a class="permalink" href="#OS_variant_support_(+)">OS
  variant support (+)</a></h2>
A number of new builtin commands are provided to support features in particular
  operating systems. All are described in detail in the <b>Builtin commands</b>
  section.
<p class="Pp">On systems that support TCF (aix-ibm370, aix-ps2), <i>getspath</i>
    and <i>setspath</i> get and set the system execution path, <i>getxvers</i>
    and <i>setxvers</i> get and set the experimental version prefix and
    <i>migrate</i> migrates processes between sites. The <i>jobs</i> builtin
    prints the site on which each job is executing.</p>
<p class="Pp">Under BS2000, <i>bs2cmd</i> executes commands of the underlying
    BS2000/OSD operating system.</p>
<p class="Pp">Under Domain/OS, <i>inlib</i> adds shared libraries to the current
    environment, <i>rootnode</i> changes the rootnode and <i>ver</i> changes the
    systype.</p>
<p class="Pp">Under Mach, <i>setpath</i> is equivalent to Mach's
    <i>setpath</i>(1).</p>
<p class="Pp">Under Masscomp/RTU and Harris CX/UX, <i>universe</i> sets the
    universe.</p>
<p class="Pp">Under Harris CX/UX, <i>ucb</i> or <i>att</i> runs a command under
    the specified universe.</p>
<p class="Pp">Under Convex/OS, <i>warp</i> prints or sets the universe.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>VENDOR</b>, <b>OSTYPE</b> and <b>MACHTYPE</b> environment
    variables indicate respectively the vendor, operating system and machine
    type (microprocessor class or machine model) of the system on which the
    shell thinks it is running. These are particularly useful when sharing one's
    home directory between several types of machines; one can, for example,</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>
  </dt>
  <dd>set path = (~/bin.$MACHTYPE /usr/ucb /bin /usr/bin .)</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">in one's <i>~/.login</i> and put executables compiled for each
    machine in the appropriate directory.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>version</b> shell variable indicates what options were
    chosen when the shell was compiled.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note also the <i>newgrp</i> builtin, the <b>afsuser</b> and
    <b>echo_style</b> shell variables and the system-dependent locations of the
    shell's input files (see <b>FILES</b>).</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Signal_handling"><a class="permalink" href="#Signal_handling">Signal
  handling</a></h2>
Login shells ignore interrupts when reading the file <i>~/.logout</i>. The shell
  ignores quit signals unless started with <b>-q</b>. Login shells catch the
  terminate signal, but non-login shells inherit the terminate behavior from
  their parents. Other signals have the values which the shell inherited from
  its parent.
<p class="Pp">In shell scripts, the shell's handling of interrupt and terminate
    signals can be controlled with <i>onintr</i>, and its handling of hangups
    can be controlled with <i>hup</i> and <i>nohup</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The shell exits on a hangup (see also the <b>logout</b> shell
    variable). By default, the shell's children do too, but the shell does not
    send them a hangup when it exits. <i>hup</i> arranges for the shell to send
    a hangup to a child when it exits, and <i>nohup</i> sets a child to ignore
    hangups.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Terminal_management_(+)"><a class="permalink" href="#Terminal_management_(+)">Terminal
  management (+)</a></h2>
The shell uses three different sets of terminal (``tty'') modes: `edit', used
  when editing, `quote', used when quoting literal characters, and `execute',
  used when executing commands. The shell holds some settings in each mode
  constant, so commands which leave the tty in a confused state do not interfere
  with the shell. The shell also matches changes in the speed and padding of the
  tty. The list of tty modes that are kept constant can be examined and modified
  with the <i>setty</i> builtin. Note that although the editor uses CBREAK mode
  (or its equivalent), it takes typed-ahead characters anyway.
<p class="Pp">The <i>echotc</i>, <i>settc</i> and <i>telltc</i> commands can be
    used to manipulate and debug terminal capabilities from the command
  line.</p>
<p class="Pp">On systems that support SIGWINCH or SIGWINDOW, the shell adapts to
    window resizing automatically and adjusts the environment variables
    <b>LINES</b> and <b>COLUMNS</b> if set. If the environment variable
    <b>TERMCAP</b> contains li# and co# fields, the shell adjusts them to
    reflect the new window size.</p>

<p class="Pp">This completion completes commands (words in position 0, `p/0')
    which begin with `co' (thus matching `co*') to `compress' (the only word in

    only ambiguous commands.</p>

    of the directory because we used lowercase <b>c</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Different <i>list</i>s are useful with different commands.</p>

</dl>
<p class="Pp">Note that the <i>complete</i> command does not itself quote its
    arguments, so the braces, space and `$' in `{print $1}' must be quoted
    explicitly.</p>
<p class="Pp">One command can have multiple completions:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>
  </dt>
  <dd>&gt; complete dbx 'p/2/(core)/' 'p/*/c/'</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">completes the second argument to `dbx' with the word `core' and
    all other arguments with commands. Note that the positional completion is
    specified before the next-word completion. Because completions are evaluated
    from left to right, if the next-word completion were specified first it
    would always match and the positional completion would never be executed.
    This is a common mistake when defining a completion.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>select</i> pattern is useful when a command takes files
    with only particular forms as arguments. For example,</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>
  </dt>
  <dd>&gt; complete cc 'p/*/f:*.[cao]/'</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">completes `cc' arguments to files ending in only `.c', `.a', or
    `.o'. <i>select</i> can also exclude files, using negation of a glob-pattern
    as described under <b>Filename substitution</b>. One might use</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>
  </dt>
  <dd>&gt; complete rm 'p/*/f:^*.{c,h,cc,C,tex,1,man,l,y}/'</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">to exclude precious source code from `rm' completion. Of course,
    one could still type excluded names manually or override the completion
    mechanism using the <i>complete-word-raw</i> or <i>list-choices-raw</i>
    editor commands (q.v.).</p>
<p class="Pp">The `C', `D', `F' and `T' <i>list</i>s are like `c', `d', `f' and
    `t' respectively, but they use the <i>select</i> argument in a different
    way: to restrict completion to files beginning with a particular path
    prefix. For example, the Elm mail program uses `=' as an abbreviation for
    one's mail directory. One might use</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>
  </dt>
  <dd>&gt; complete elm c@=@F:$HOME/Mail/@</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">to complete `elm -f =' as if it were `elm -f ~/Mail/'. Note that
    we used `@' instead of `/' to avoid confusion with the <i>select</i>
    argument, and we used `$HOME' instead of `~' because home directory
    substitution works at only the beginning of a word.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>suffix</i> is used to add a nonstandard suffix (not space or
    `/' for directories) to completed words.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>
  </dt>
  <dd>&gt; complete finger 'c/*@/$hostnames/' 'p/1/u/@'</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">completes arguments to `finger' from the list of users, appends an
    `@', and then completes after the `@' from the `hostnames' variable. Note
    again the order in which the completions are specified.</p>
<p class="Pp">Finally, here's a complex example for inspiration:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>
  </dt>
  <dd>&gt; complete find \
    <br/>
    'n/-name/f/' 'n/-newer/f/' 'n/-{,n}cpio/f/' \
    <br/>

    ls mtime nogroup nouser perm print prune \
    <br/>
    size xdev)/' \
    <br/>
    'p/*/d/'</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">This completes words following `-name', `-newer', `-cpio' or
    `ncpio' (note the pattern which matches both) to files, words following
    `-exec' or `-ok' to commands, words following `user' and `group' to users
    and groups respectively and words following `-fstype' or `-type' to members
    of the given lists. It also completes the switches themselves from the given
    list (note the use of <b>c</b>-type completion) and completes anything not
    otherwise completed to a directory. Whew.</p>
<p class="Pp">Remember that programmed completions are ignored if the word being
    completed is a tilde substitution (beginning with `~') or a variable
    (beginning with `$'). See also the <i>uncomplete</i> builtin command.</p>

  shell variables</a></h2>
The variables described in this section have special meaning to the shell.
<p class="Pp">The shell sets <b>addsuffix</b>, <b>argv</b>, <b>autologout</b>,
    <b>csubstnonl</b>, <b>command</b>, <b>echo_style</b>, <b>edit</b>,
    <b>gid</b>, <b>group</b>, <b>home</b>, <b>loginsh</b>, <b>oid</b>,
    <b>path</b>, <b>prompt</b>, <b>prompt2</b>, <b>prompt3</b>, <b>shell</b>,
    <b>shlvl</b>, <b>tcsh</b>, <b>term</b>, <b>tty</b>, <b>uid</b>, <b>user</b>
    and <b>version</b> at startup; they do not change thereafter unless changed
    by the user. The shell updates <b>cwd</b>, <b>dirstack</b>, <b>owd</b> and
    <b>status</b> when necessary, and sets <b>logout</b> on logout.</p>
<p class="Pp">The shell synchronizes <b>group</b>, <b>home</b>, <b>path</b>,
    <b>shlvl</b>, <b>term</b> and <b>user</b> with the environment variables of
    the same names: whenever the environment variable changes the shell changes
    the corresponding shell variable to match (unless the shell variable is
    read-only) and vice versa. Note that although <b>cwd</b> and <b>PWD</b> have
    identical meanings, they are not synchronized in this manner, and that the
    shell automatically converts between the different formats of <b>path</b>
    and <b>PATH</b>.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>addsuffix (+)</b></dt>
  <dd>If set, filename completion adds `/' to the end of directories and a space
      to the end of normal files when they are matched exactly. Set by
    default.</dd>
  <dt><b>afsuser (+)</b></dt>
  <dd>If set, <b>autologout</b>'s autolock feature uses its value instead of the
      local username for kerberos authentication.</dd>
  <dt><b>ampm (+)</b></dt>
  <dd>If set, all times are shown in 12-hour AM/PM format.</dd>
  <dt><b>anyerror (+)</b></dt>
  <dd>This variable selects what is propagated to the value of the <b>status</b>
      variable. For more information see the description of the <b>status</b>
      variable below.</dd>
  <dt><b>argv</b></dt>
  <dd>The arguments to the shell. Positional parameters are taken from
      <b>argv</b>, i.e., `$1' is replaced by `$argv[1]', etc. Set by default,
      but usually empty in interactive shells.</dd>
  <dt><b>autocorrect (+)</b></dt>
  <dd>If set, the <i>spell-word</i> editor command is invoked automatically
      before each completion attempt.</dd>
  <dt><b>autoexpand (+)</b></dt>
  <dd>If set, the <i>expand-history</i> editor command is invoked automatically
      before each completion attempt. If this is set to <i>onlyhistory</i>, then
      only history will be expanded and a second completion will expand
      filenames.</dd>
  <dt><b>autolist (+)</b></dt>
  <dd>If set, possibilities are listed after an ambiguous completion. If set to
      `ambiguous', possibilities are listed only when no new characters are
      added by completion.</dd>
  <dt><b>autologout (+)</b></dt>
  <dd>The first word is the number of minutes of inactivity before automatic
      logout. The optional second word is the number of minutes of inactivity
      before automatic locking. When the shell automatically logs out, it prints
      `auto-logout', sets the variable <b>logout</b> to `automatic' and exits.
      When the shell automatically locks, the user is required to enter his
      password to continue working. Five incorrect attempts result in automatic
      logout. Set to `60' (automatic logout after 60 minutes, and no locking) by
      default in login and superuser shells, but not if the shell thinks it is
      running under a window system (i.e., the <b>DISPLAY</b> environment
      variable is set), the tty is a pseudo-tty (pty) or the shell was not so
      compiled (see the <b>version</b> shell variable). See also the
      <b>afsuser</b> and <b>logout</b> shell variables.</dd>
  <dt><b>autorehash (+)</b></dt>
  <dd>If set, the internal hash table of the contents of the directories in the
      <b>path</b> variable will be recomputed if a command is not found in the
      hash table. In addition, the list of available commands will be rebuilt
      for each command completion or spelling correction attempt if set to
      `complete' or `correct' respectively; if set to `always', this will be
      done for both cases.</dd>
  <dt><b>backslash_quote (+)</b></dt>
  <dd>If set, backslashes (`\') always quote `\', `'', and `&quot;'. This may
      make complex quoting tasks easier, but it can cause syntax errors in
      <i>csh</i>(1) scripts.</dd>
  <dt><b>catalog</b></dt>
  <dd>The file name of the message catalog. If set, tcsh use `tcsh.${catalog}'
      as a message catalog instead of default `tcsh'.</dd>
  <dt><b>cdpath</b></dt>
  <dd>A list of directories in which <i>cd</i> should search for subdirectories
      if they aren't found in the current directory.</dd>
  <dt><b>cdtohome (+)</b></dt>
  <dd>If not set, <i>cd</i> requires a directory <i>name</i>, and will not go to
      the <b>home</b> directory if it's omitted. This is set by default.</dd>
  <dt><b>color</b></dt>
  <dd>If set, it enables color display for the builtin <b>ls-F</b> and it passes
      <b>--color=auto</b> to <b>ls</b>. Alternatively, it can be set to only
      <b>ls-F</b> or only <b>ls</b> to enable color to only one command. Setting
      it to nothing is equivalent to setting it to <b>(ls-F ls)</b>.</dd>
  <dt><b>colorcat</b></dt>
  <dd>If set, it enables color escape sequence for NLS message files. And
      display colorful NLS messages.</dd>
  <dt><b>command (+)</b></dt>
  <dd>If set, the command which was passed to the shell with the <b>-c</b> flag
      (q.v.).</dd>
  <dt><b>compat_expr (+)</b></dt>
  <dd>If set, the shell will evaluate expressions right to left, like the
      original <i>csh</i>.</dd>
  <dt><b>complete (+)</b></dt>
  <dd>If set to `igncase', the completion becomes case insensitive. If set to
      `enhance', completion ignores case and considers hyphens and underscores
      to be equivalent; it will also treat periods, hyphens and underscores
      (`.', `-' and `_') as word separators. If set to `Enhance', completion
      matches uppercase and underscore characters explicitly and matches
      lowercase and hyphens in a case-insensitive manner; it will treat periods,
      hyphens and underscores as word separators.</dd>
  <dt><b>continue (+)</b></dt>
  <dd>If set to a list of commands, the shell will continue the listed commands,
      instead of starting a new one.</dd>
  <dt><b>continue_args (+)</b></dt>

  <dt><b>dirsfile (+)</b></dt>
  <dd>The default location in which `dirs -S' and `dirs -L' look for a history
      file. If unset, <i>~/.cshdirs</i> is used. Because only <i>~/.tcshrc</i>
      is normally sourced before <i>~/.cshdirs</i>, <b>dirsfile</b> should be
      set in <i>~/.tcshrc</i> rather than <i>~/.login</i>.</dd>
  <dt><b>dirstack (+)</b></dt>
  <dd>An array of all the directories on the directory stack. `$dirstack[1]' is
      the current working directory, `$dirstack[2]' the first directory on the
      stack, etc. Note that the current working directory is `$dirstack[1]' but
      `=0' in directory stack substitutions, etc. One can change the stack
      arbitrarily by setting <b>dirstack</b>, but the first element (the current
      working directory) is always correct. See also the <b>cwd</b> and
      <b>owd</b> shell variables.</dd>
  <dt><b>dspmbyte (+)</b></dt>
  <dd>Has an effect iff 'dspm' is listed as part of the <b>version</b> shell
      variable. If set to `euc', it enables display and editing
      EUC-kanji(Japanese) code. If set to `sjis', it enables display and editing
      Shift-JIS(Japanese) code. If set to `big5', it enables display and editing
      Big5(Chinese) code. If set to `utf8', it enables display and editing
      Utf8(Unicode) code. If set to the following format, it enables display and
      editing of original multi-byte code format:</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>
  </dt>
  <dd>&gt; set dspmbyte = 0000....(256 bytes)....0000</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The table requires <b>just</b> 256 bytes. Each character of 256
    characters corresponds (from left to right) to the ASCII codes 0x00, 0x01,
    ... 0xff. Each character is set to number 0,1,2 and 3. Each number has the
    following meaning:
   0 ... not used for multi-byte characters.
   1 ... used for the first byte of a multi-byte character.
   2 ... used for the second byte of a multi-byte character.
   3 ... used for both the first byte and second byte of a multi-byte
  character.</p>
<p class="Pp">
   Example:
  <br/>
  If set to `001322', the first character (means 0x00 of the ASCII code) and
    second character (means 0x01 of ASCII code) are set to `0'. Then, it is not
    used for multi-byte characters. The 3rd character (0x02) is set to '1',
    indicating that it is used for the first byte of a multi-byte character. The
    4th character(0x03) is set '3'. It is used for both the first byte and the
    second byte of a multi-byte character. The 5th and 6th characters
    (0x04,0x05) are set to '2', indicating that they are used for the second
    byte of a multi-byte character.</p>
<p class="Pp">The GNU fileutils version of ls cannot display multi-byte
    filenames without the -N ( --literal ) option. If you are using this
    version, set the second word of dspmbyte to &quot;ls&quot;. If not, for
    example, &quot;ls-F -l&quot; cannot display multi-byte filenames.</p>

  <dt><b>histdup (+)</b></dt>
  <dd>Controls handling of duplicate entries in the history list. If set to
      `all' only unique history events are entered in the history list. If set
      to `prev' and the last history event is the same as the current command,
      then the current command is not entered in the history. If set to `erase'
      and the same event is found in the history list, that old event gets
      erased and the current one gets inserted. Note that the `prev' and `all'
      options renumber history events so there are no gaps.</dd>
  <dt><b>histfile (+)</b></dt>
  <dd>The default location in which `history -S' and `history -L' look for a
      history file. If unset, <i>~/.history</i> is used. <b>histfile</b> is
      useful when sharing the same home directory between different machines, or
      when saving separate histories on different terminals. Because only
      <i>~/.tcshrc</i> is normally sourced before <i>~/.history</i>,
      <b>histfile</b> should be set in <i>~/.tcshrc</i> rather than

  <dt><b>history</b></dt>
  <dd>The first word indicates the number of history events to save. The
      optional second word (+) indicates the format in which history is printed;
      if not given, `%h\t%T\t%R\n' is used. The format sequences are described
      below under <b>prompt</b>; note the variable meaning of `%R'. Set to `100'
      by default.</dd>
  <dt><b>home</b></dt>
  <dd>Initialized to the home directory of the invoker. The filename expansion
      of `<i>~</i>' refers to this variable.</dd>
  <dt><b>ignoreeof</b></dt>
  <dd>If set to the empty string or `0' and the input device is a terminal, the
      <i>end-of-file</i> command (usually generated by the user by typing `^D'
      on an empty line) causes the shell to print `Use &quot;exit&quot; to leave
      tcsh.' instead of exiting. This prevents the shell from accidentally being
      killed. Historically this setting exited after 26 successive EOF's to
      avoid infinite loops. If set to a number <i>n</i>, the shell ignores <i>n
      - 1</i> consecutive <i>end-of-file</i>s and exits on the <i>n</i>th. (+)
      If unset, `1' is used, i.e., the shell exits on a single `^D'.</dd>
  <dt><b>implicitcd (+)</b></dt>
  <dd>If set, the shell treats a directory name typed as a command as though it
      were a request to change to that directory. If set to <i>verbose</i>, the
      change of directory is echoed to the standard output. This behavior is
      inhibited in non-interactive shell scripts, or for command strings with
      more than one word. Changing directory takes precedence over executing a
      like-named command, but it is done after alias substitutions. Tilde and
      variable expansions work as expected.</dd>
  <dt><b>inputmode (+)</b></dt>
  <dd>If set to `insert' or `overwrite', puts the editor into that input mode at
      the beginning of each line.</dd>
  <dt><b>killdup (+)</b></dt>
  <dd>Controls handling of duplicate entries in the kill ring. If set to `all'
      only unique strings are entered in the kill ring. If set to `prev' and the
      last killed string is the same as the current killed string, then the
      current string is not entered in the ring. If set to `erase' and the same
      string is found in the kill ring, the old string is erased and the current
      one is inserted.</dd>
  <dt><b>killring (+)</b></dt>
  <dd>Indicates the number of killed strings to keep in memory. Set to `30' by
      default. If unset or set to less than `2', the shell will only keep the
      most recently killed string. Strings are put in the killring by the editor
      commands that delete (kill) strings of text, e.g.
      <i>backward-delete-word</i>, <i>kill-line</i>, etc, as well as the
      <i>copy-region-as-kill</i> command. The <i>yank</i> editor command will
      yank the most recently killed string into the command-line, while
      <i>yank-pop</i> (see <b>Editor commands</b>) can be used to yank earlier
      killed strings.</dd>
  <dt><b>listflags (+)</b></dt>
  <dd>If set to `x', `a' or `A', or any combination thereof (e.g., `xA'), they
      are used as flags to <i>ls-F</i>, making it act like `ls -xF', `ls -Fa',
      `ls -FA' or a combination (e.g., `ls -FxA'): `a' shows all files (even if
      they start with a `.'), `A' shows all files but `.' and `..', and `x'
      sorts across instead of down. If the second word of <b>listflags</b> is
      set, it is used as the path to `ls(1)'.</dd>
  <dt><b>listjobs (+)</b></dt>
  <dd>If set, all jobs are listed when a job is suspended. If set to `long', the
      listing is in long format.</dd>

  <dd>If set, the <i>ls-F</i> builtin command shows the type of file to which
      each symbolic link points.</dd>
  <dt><b>listmax (+)</b></dt>
  <dd>The maximum number of items which the <i>list-choices</i> editor command
      will list without asking first.</dd>

  <dd>The maximum number of rows of items which the <i>list-choices</i> editor
      command will list without asking first.</dd>
  <dt><b>loginsh (+)</b></dt>
  <dd>Set by the shell if it is a login shell. Setting or unsetting it within a
      shell has no effect. See also <b>shlvl</b>.</dd>
  <dt><b>logout (+)</b></dt>
  <dd>Set by the shell to `normal' before a normal logout, `automatic' before an
      automatic logout, and `hangup' if the shell was killed by a hangup signal
      (see <b>Signal handling</b>). See also the <b>autologout</b> shell
      variable.</dd>
  <dt><b>mail</b></dt>
  <dd>A list of files and directories to check for incoming mail, optionally
      preceded by a numeric word. Before each prompt, if 10 minutes have passed
      since the last check, the shell checks each file and says `You have new
      mail.' (or, if <b>mail</b> contains multiple files, `You have new mail in
      <i>name</i>.') if the filesize is greater than zero in size and has a
      modification time greater than its access time.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">If you are in a login shell, then no mail file is reported unless
    it has been modified after the time the shell has started up, to prevent
    redundant notifications. Most login programs will tell you whether or not
    you have mail when you log in.</p>
<p class="Pp">If a file specified in <b>mail</b> is a directory, the shell will
    count each file within that directory as a separate message, and will report
    `You have <i>n</i> mails.' or `You have <i>n</i> mails in <i>name</i>.' as
    appropriate. This functionality is provided primarily for those systems
    which store mail in this manner, such as the Andrew Mail System.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the first word of <b>mail</b> is numeric it is taken as a
    different mail checking interval, in seconds.</p>

  <dd>A list of directories in which to look for executable commands. A null
      word specifies the current directory. If there is no <b>path</b> variable

      not exist, to a system-dependent default something like `(/usr/local/bin
      /usr/bsd /bin /usr/bin .)'. The shell may put `.' first or last in
      <b>path</b> or omit it entirely depending on how it was compiled; see the
      <b>version</b> shell variable. A shell which is given neither the
      <b>-c</b> nor the <b>-t</b> option hashes the contents of the directories
      in <b>path</b> after reading <i>~/.tcshrc</i> and each time <b>path</b> is

</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">If the <b>anyerror</b> variable is unset, the exit status of a

  <dt><b>symlinks (+)</b></dt>
  <dd>Can be set to several different values to control symbolic link
      (`symlink') resolution:</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">If set to `chase', whenever the current directory changes to a
    directory containing a symbolic link, it is expanded to the real name of the
    directory to which the link points. This does not work for the user's home
    directory; this is a bug.</p>
<p class="Pp">If set to `ignore', the shell tries to construct a current
    directory relative to the current directory before the link was crossed.
    This means that <i>cd</i>ing through a symbolic link and then `cd ..'ing
    returns one to the original directory. This affects only builtin commands
    and filename completion.</p>
<p class="Pp">If set to `expand', the shell tries to fix symbolic links by
    actually expanding arguments which look like path names. This affects any
    command, not just builtins. Unfortunately, this does not work for
    hard-to-recognize filenames, such as those embedded in command options.
    Expansion may be prevented by quoting. While this setting is usually the
    most convenient, it is sometimes misleading and sometimes confusing when it
    fails to recognize an argument which should be expanded. A compromise is to
    use `ignore' and use the editor command <i>normalize-path</i> (bound by
    default to ^X-n) when necessary.</p>
<p class="Pp">Some examples are in order. First, let's set up some play

<p class="Pp">You need to include only the variables you want to change from the
    default.</p>
<p class="Pp">File names can also be colorized based on filename extension. This
    is specified in the <b>LS_COLORS</b> variable using the syntax
    <b>&quot;*ext=string&quot;</b>. For example, using ISO 6429 codes, to color
    all C-language source files blue you would specify
    <b>&quot;*.c=34&quot;</b>. This would color all files ending in <b>.c</b> in
    blue (34) color.</p>
<p class="Pp">Control characters can be written either in C-style-escaped
    notation, or in stty-like ^-notation. The C-style notation adds <b>^[</b>
    for Escape, <b>_</b> for a normal space character, and <b>?</b> for Delete.
    In addition, the <b>^[</b> escape character can be used to override the
    default interpretation of <b>^[</b>, <b>^</b>, <b>:</b> and <b>=</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Each file will be written as <b>&lt;lc&gt;</b>
    <b>&lt;color-code&gt;</b> <b>&lt;rc&gt;</b> <b>&lt;filename&gt;</b>
    <b>&lt;ec&gt;</b>. If the <b>&lt;ec&gt;</b> code is undefined, the sequence
    <b>&lt;lc&gt;</b> <b>&lt;no&gt;</b> <b></b><b>&lt;rc&gt;</b> will be used
    instead. This is generally more convenient to use, but less general. The
    left, right and end codes are provided so you don't have to type common
    parts over and over again and to support weird terminals; you will generally
    not need to change them at all unless your terminal does not use ISO 6429
    color sequences but a different system.</p>
<p class="Pp">If your terminal does use ISO 6429 color codes, you can compose
    the type codes (i.e., all except the <b>lc</b>, <b>rc</b>, and <b>ec</b>
    codes) from numerical commands separated by semicolons. The most common
    commands are:</p>

When a suspended command is restarted, the shell prints the directory it started
  in if this is different from the current directory. This can be misleading
  (i.e., wrong) as the job may have changed directories internally.
<p class="Pp">Shell builtin functions are not stoppable/restartable. Command
    sequences of the form `a ; b ; c' are also not handled gracefully when
    stopping is attempted. If you suspend `b', the shell will then immediately
    execute `c'. This is especially noticeable if this expansion results from an
    <i>alias</i>. It suffices to place the sequence of commands in ()'s to force
    it to a subshell, i.e., `( a ; b ; c )'.</p>
<p class="Pp">Control over tty output after processes are started is primitive;
    perhaps this will inspire someone to work on a good virtual terminal
    interface. In a virtual terminal interface much more interesting things
    could be done with output control.</p>
<p class="Pp">Alias substitution is most often used to clumsily simulate shell
    procedures; shell procedures should be provided rather than aliases.</p>
<p class="Pp">Control structures should be parsed rather than being recognized
    as built-in commands. This would allow control commands to be placed
    anywhere, to be combined with `|', and to be used with `&amp;' and `;'
    metasyntax.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>foreach</i> doesn't ignore here documents when looking for its
    <i>end</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">It should be possible to use the `:' modifiers on the output of
    command substitutions.</p>
<p class="Pp">The screen update for lines longer than the screen width is very
    poor if the terminal cannot move the cursor up (i.e., terminal type
  `dumb').</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>HPATH</b> and <b>NOREBIND</b> don't need to be environment
    variables.</p>
<p class="Pp">Glob-patterns which do not use `?', `*' or `[]' or which use `{}'
    or `~' are not negated correctly.</p>
<p class="Pp">The single-command form of <i>if</i> does output redirection even
    if the expression is false and the command is not executed.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>ls-F</i> includes file identification characters when sorting
    filenames and does not handle control characters in filenames well. It
    cannot be interrupted.</p>
<p class="Pp">Command substitution supports multiple commands and conditions,
    but not cycles or backward <i>goto</i>s.</p>

  T IN TCSH</a></h1>
In 1964, DEC produced the PDP-6. The PDP-10 was a later re-implementation. It
  was re-christened the DECsystem-10 in 1970 or so when DEC brought out the
  second model, the KI10.
<p class="Pp">TENEX was created at Bolt, Beranek &amp; Newman (a Cambridge,
    Massachusetts think tank) in 1972 as an experiment in demand-paged virtual
    memory operating systems. They built a new pager for the DEC PDP-10 and
    created the OS to go with it. It was extremely successful in academia.</p>
<p class="Pp">In 1975, DEC brought out a new model of the PDP-10, the KL10; they
    intended to have only a version of TENEX, which they had licensed from BBN,
    for the new box. They called their version TOPS-20 (their capitalization is
    trademarked). A lot of TOPS-10 users (`The OPerating System for PDP-10')
    objected; thus DEC found themselves supporting two incompatible systems on
    the same hardware--but then there were 6 on the PDP-11!</p>
<p class="Pp">TENEX, and TOPS-20 to version 3, had command completion via a
    user-code-level subroutine library called ULTCMD. With version 3, DEC moved
    all that capability and more into the monitor (`kernel' for you Unix types),
    accessed by the COMND% JSYS (`Jump to SYStem' instruction, the supervisor
    call mechanism [are my IBM roots also showing?]).</p>
<p class="Pp">The creator of tcsh was impressed by this feature and several
    others of TENEX and TOPS-20, and created a version of csh which mimicked
    them.</p>

The system limits argument lists to ARG_MAX characters.
<p class="Pp">The number of arguments to a command which involves filename
    expansion is limited to 1/6th the number of characters allowed in an
    argument list.</p>
<p class="Pp">Command substitutions may substitute no more characters than are
    allowed in an argument list.</p>
<p class="Pp">To detect looping, the shell restricts the number of <i>alias</i>
    substitutions on a single line to 20.</p>
