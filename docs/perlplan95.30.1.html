   Set up some character translations and predefined strings.  \*(-- will
   give an unbreakable dash, \*(PI will give pi, \*(L" will give a left
   double quote, and \*(R" will give a right double quote.  \*(C+ will
   give a nicer C++.  Capital omega is used to do unbreakable dashes and
   therefore won't be available.  \*(C` and \*(C' expand to `' in nroff,
   nothing in troff, for use with C<>.

These are a few notes describing features peculiar to Plan 9 Perl. As such, it
  is not intended to be a replacement for the rest of the Perl 5 documentation
  (which is both copious and excellent). If you have any questions to which you
  can't find answers in these man pages, contact Luther Huffman at
  lutherh@stratcom.com and we'll try to answer them.

<h2 class="Ss" id="Invoking_Perl"><a class="permalink" href="#Invoking_Perl">Invoking
  Perl</a></h2>
Perl is invoked from the command line as described in perl. Most perl scripts,
  however, do have a first line such as &quot;#!/usr/local/bin/perl&quot;. This
  is known as a shebang (shell-bang) statement and tells the OS shell where to
  find the perl interpreter. In Plan 9 Perl this statement should be
  &quot;#!/bin/perl&quot; if you wish to be able to directly invoke the script
  by its name.
 Alternatively, you may invoke perl with the command &quot;Perl&quot; instead of
  &quot;perl&quot;. This will produce Acme-friendly error messages of the form
  &quot;filename:18&quot;.
<p class="Pp">Some scripts, usually identified with a *.PL extension, are
    self-configuring and are able to correctly create their own shebang path
    from config information located in Plan 9 Perl. These you won't need to be
    worried about.</p>

Although Plan 9 Perl currently only provides static loading, it is built with a
  number of useful extensions. These include Opcode, FileHandle, Fcntl, and
  POSIX. Expect to see others (and DynaLoading!) in the future.

Some, such as <span class="Li">&quot;chown&quot;</span> and
  <span class="Li">&quot;umask&quot;</span> aren't provided because the concept
  does not exist within Plan 9. Others, such as some of the socket-related
  functions, simply haven't been written yet. Many in the latter category may be
  supported in the future.
<p class="Pp">The functions not currently implemented include:</p>

WELCOME to Plan 9 Perl, brave soul!
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
   This is a preliminary alpha version of Plan 9 Perl. Still to be
implemented are MakeMaker and DynaLoader. Many perl commands are
missing or currently behave in an inscrutable manner. These gaps will,
with perseverance and a modicum of luck, be remedied in the near
future.To install this software:
</pre>
<p class="Pp">1. Create the source directories and libraries for perl by running
    the plan9/setup.rc command (i.e., located in the plan9 subdirectory). Note:
    the setup routine assumes that you haven't dearchived these files into
    /sys/src/cmd/perl. After running setup.rc you may delete the copy of the
    source you originally detarred, as source code has now been installed in
    /sys/src/cmd/perl. If you plan on installing perl binaries for all
    architectures, run &quot;setup.rc -a&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">2. After making sure that you have adequate privileges to build
    system software, from /sys/src/cmd/perl/5.00301 (adjust version
    appropriately) run:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
        mk install
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If you wish to install perl versions for all architectures (68020,
    mips, sparc and 386) run:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
        mk installall
</pre>
<p class="Pp">3. Wait. The build process will take a *long* time because perl
    bootstraps itself. A 75MHz Pentium, 16MB RAM machine takes roughly 30
    minutes to build the distribution from scratch.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Installing_Perl_Documentation_on_Plan_9"><a class="permalink" href="#Installing_Perl_Documentation_on_Plan_9">Installing
  Perl Documentation on Plan 9</a></h2>
This perl distribution comes with a tremendous amount of documentation. To add
  these to the built-in manuals that come with Plan 9, from
  /sys/src/cmd/perl/5.00301 (adjust version appropriately) run:
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
        mk man
</pre>
<p class="Pp">To begin your reading, start with:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
        man perl
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This is a good introduction and will direct you towards other man
    pages that may interest you.</p>

    not.)</p>
