<p class="Pp"><i>zipinfo</i> lists technical information about files in a ZIP
    archive, most commonly found on MS-DOS systems. Such information includes
    file access permissions, encryption status, type of compression, version and
    operating system or file system of compressing program, and the like. The
    default behavior (with no options) is to list single-line entries for each
    file in the archive, with header and trailer lines providing summary
    information for the entire archive. The format is a cross between Unix ``ls
    -l'' and ``unzip -v'' output. See <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b> below. Note
    that <i>zipinfo</i> is the same program as <i>unzip</i> (under Unix, a link
    to it); on some systems, however, <i>zipinfo</i> support may have been
    omitted when <i>unzip</i> was compiled.</p>

  <dd>Path of the ZIP archive(s). If the file specification is a wildcard, each
      matching file is processed in an order determined by the operating system
      (or file system). Only the filename can be a wildcard; the path itself
      cannot. Wildcard expressions are similar to Unix <i>egrep</i>(1) (regular)
      expressions and may contain:</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">

  <dd>matches exactly 1 character</dd>
  <dt>[...]</dt>
  <dd>matches any single character found inside the brackets; ranges are
      specified by a beginning character, a hyphen, and an ending character. If
      an exclamation point or a caret (`!' or `^') follows the left bracket,
      then the range of characters within the brackets is complemented (that is,
      anything <i>except</i> the characters inside the brackets is considered a
      match). To specify a verbatim left bracket, the three-character sequence
      ``[[]'' has to be used.</dd>

  <dd>(Be sure to quote any character that might otherwise be interpreted or

      and if that also fails, the suffix .zip is appended. Note that

      just specify the .exe suffix (if any) explicitly.</dd>

      notice if long lines wrap at the edge of the screen, effectively resulting
      in the printing of two or more lines and the likelihood that some text

      size does not include the 12 additional header bytes of each encrypted

<h1 class="Sh" id="DETAILED_DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DETAILED_DESCRIPTION">DETAILED
  DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp"><i>zipinfo</i> has a number of modes, and its behavior can be
    rather difficult to fathom if one isn't familiar with Unix <i>ls</i>(1) (or
    even if one is). The default behavior is to list files in the following
    format:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
-rw-rws---  1.9 unx    2802 t- defX 11-Aug-91 13:48 perms.2660
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The last three fields are the modification date and time of the
    file, and its name. The case of the filename is respected; thus files that
    come from MS-DOS PKZIP are always capitalized. If the file was zipped with a
    stored directory name, that is also displayed as part of the filename.</p>
<p class="Pp">The second and third fields indicate that the file was zipped
    under Unix with version 1.9 of <i>zip</i>. Since it comes from Unix, the
    file permissions at the beginning of the line are printed in Unix format.
    The uncompressed file-size (2802 in this example) is the fourth field.</p>
<p class="Pp">The fifth field consists of two characters, either of which may
    take on several values. The first character may be either `t' or `b',
    indicating that <i>zip</i> believes the file to be text or binary,
    respectively; but if the file is encrypted, <i>zipinfo</i> notes this fact
    by capitalizing the character (`T' or `B'). The second character may also
    take on four values, depending on whether there is an extended local header
    and/or an ``extra field'' associated with the file (fully explained in
    PKWare's APPNOTE.TXT, but basically analogous to pragmas in ANSI C--i.e.,
    they provide a standard way to include non-standard information in the
    archive). If neither exists, the character will be a hyphen (`-'); if there
    is an extended local header but no extra field, `l'; if the reverse, `x';
    and if both exist, `X'. Thus the file in this example is (probably) a text
    file, is not encrypted, and has neither an extra field nor an extended local
    header associated with it. The example below, on the other hand, is an
    encrypted binary file with an extra field:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
RWD,R,R     0.9 vms     168 Bx shrk  9-Aug-91 19:15 perms.0644
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Extra fields are used for various purposes (see discussion of the
    <b>-v</b> option below) including the storage of VMS file attributes, which
    is presumably the case here. Note that the file attributes are listed in VMS
    format. Some other possibilities for the host operating system (which is
    actually a misnomer--host file system is more correct) include OS/2 or NT
    with High Performance File System (HPFS), MS-DOS, OS/2 or NT with File
    Allocation Table (FAT) file system, and Macintosh. These are denoted as
    follows:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
-rw-a--     1.0 hpf    5358 Tl i4:3  4-Dec-91 11:33 longfilename.hpfs
</pre>
<pre>
-r--ahs     1.1 fat    4096 b- i4:2 14-Jul-91 12:58 EA DATA. SF
</pre>
<pre>
--w-------  1.0 mac   17357 bx i8:2  4-May-92 04:02 unzip.macr
</pre>
<p class="Pp">File attributes in the first two cases are indicated in a
    Unix-like format, where the seven subfields indicate whether the file: (1)
    is a directory, (2) is readable (always true), (3) is writable, (4) is
    executable (guessed on the basis of the extension--<i>.exe</i>, <i>.com</i>,
    <i>.bat</i>, <i>.cmd</i> and <i>.btm</i> files are assumed to be so), (5)
    has its archive bit set, (6) is hidden, and (7) is a system file.
    Interpretation of Macintosh file attributes is unreliable because some
    Macintosh archivers don't store any attributes in the archive.</p>
<p class="Pp">Finally, the sixth field indicates the compression method and
    possible sub-method used. There are six methods known at present: storing
    (no compression), reducing, shrinking, imploding, tokenizing (never publicly
    released), and deflating. In addition, there are four levels of reducing (1
    through 4); four types of imploding (4K or 8K sliding dictionary, and 2 or 3
    Shannon-Fano trees); and four levels of deflating (superfast, fast, normal,
    maximum compression). <i>zipinfo</i> represents these methods and their
    sub-methods as follows: <i>stor</i>; <i>re:1</i>, <i>re:2</i>, etc.;
    <i>shrk</i>; <i>i4:2</i>, <i>i8:3</i>, etc.; <i>tokn</i>; and <i>defS</i>,
    <i>defF</i>, <i>defN</i>, and <i>defX</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The medium and long listings are almost identical to the short
    format except that they add information on the file's compression. The
    medium format lists the file's compression factor as a percentage indicating
    the amount of space that has been ``removed'':</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
-rw-rws---  1.5 unx    2802 t- 81% defX 11-Aug-91 13:48 perms.2660
</pre>
<p class="Pp">In this example, the file has been compressed by more than a
    factor of five; the compressed data are only 19% of the original size. The
    long format gives the compressed file's size in bytes, instead:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
-rw-rws---  1.5 unx    2802 t-     538 defX 11-Aug-91 13:48 perms.2660
</pre>
<p class="Pp">In contrast to the <i>unzip</i> listings, the compressed size
    figures in this listing format denote the complete size of compressed data,
    including the 12 extra header bytes in case of encrypted entries.</p>
<p class="Pp">Adding the <b>-T</b> option changes the file date and time to
    decimal format:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
-rw-rws---  1.5 unx    2802 t-     538 defX 910811.134804 perms.2660
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Note that because of limitations in the MS-DOS format used to
    store file times, the seconds field is always rounded to the nearest even
    second. For Unix files this is expected to change in the next major releases
    of <i>zip</i>(1L) and <i>unzip</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">In addition to individual file information, a default zipfile
    listing also includes header and trailer lines:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
Archive:  OS2.zip   5453 bytes   5 files
</pre>
<pre>
,,rw,       1.0 hpf     730 b- i4:3 26-Jun-92 23:40 Contents
</pre>
<pre>
,,rw,       1.0 hpf    3710 b- i4:3 26-Jun-92 23:33 makefile.os2
</pre>
<pre>
,,rw,       1.0 hpf    8753 b- i8:3 26-Jun-92 15:29 os2unzip.c
</pre>
<pre>

</pre>
<pre>
,,rw,       1.0 hpf      95 b- stor 21-Aug-91 17:51 zipinfo.def
</pre>
<pre>
5 files, 13386 bytes uncompressed, 4951 bytes compressed:  63.0%
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The header line gives the name of the archive, its total size, and
    the total number of files; the trailer gives the number of files listed,
    their total uncompressed size, and their total compressed size (not
    including any of <i>zip</i>'s internal overhead). If, however, one or more
    <i>file(s)</i> are provided, the header and trailer lines are not listed.
    This behavior is also similar to that of Unix's ``ls -l''; it may be
    overridden by specifying the <b>-h</b> and <b>-t</b> options explicitly. In
    such a case the listing format must also be specified explicitly, since
    <b>-h</b> or <b>-t</b> (or both) in the absence of other options implies
    that ONLY the header or trailer line (or both) is listed. See the
    <b>EXAMPLES</b> section below for a semi-intelligible translation of this
    nonsense.</p>
<p class="Pp">The verbose listing is mostly self-explanatory. It also lists file
    comments and the zipfile comment, if any, and the type and number of bytes
    in any stored extra fields. Currently known types of extra fields include
    PKWARE's authentication (``AV'') info; OS/2 extended attributes; VMS
    filesystem info, both PKWARE and Info-ZIP versions; Macintosh resource
    forks; Acorn/Archimedes SparkFS info; and so on. (Note that in the case of
    OS/2 extended attributes--perhaps the most common use of zipfile extra
    fields--the size of the stored EAs as reported by <i>zipinfo</i> may not
    match the number given by OS/2's <i>dir</i> command: OS/2 always reports the
    number of bytes required in 16-bit format, whereas <i>zipinfo</i> always
    reports the 32-bit storage.)</p>
<p class="Pp">Again, the compressed size figures of the individual entries
    include the 12 extra header bytes for encrypted entries. In contrast, the
    archive total compressed size and the average compression ratio shown in the
    summary bottom line are calculated <b>without</b> the extra 12 header bytes
    of encrypted entries.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="ENVIRONMENT_OPTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#ENVIRONMENT_OPTIONS">ENVIRONMENT
  OPTIONS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Modifying <i>zipinfo</i>'s default behavior via options placed in
    an environment variable can be a bit complicated to explain, due to
    <i>zipinfo</i>'s attempts to handle various defaults in an intuitive, yet
    Unix-like, manner. (Try not to laugh.) Nevertheless, there is some
    underlying logic. In brief, there are three ``priority levels'' of options:
    the default options; environment options, which can override or add to the
    defaults; and explicit options given by the user, which can override or add
    to either of the above.</p>
<p class="Pp">The default listing format, as noted above, corresponds roughly to
    the &quot;zipinfo -hst&quot; command (except when individual zipfile members
    are specified). A user who prefers the long-listing format (<b>-l</b>) can
    make use of the <i>zipinfo</i>'s environment variable to change this
    default:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="Unix"><a class="permalink" href="#Unix">Unix Bourne shell:</a></dt>
  <dd><span class="Li">ZIPINFO=-l; export ZIPINFO</span></dd>
  <dt id="Unix~2"><a class="permalink" href="#Unix~2">Unix C shell:</a></dt>
  <dd><span class="Li">setenv ZIPINFO -l</span></dd>
  <dt id="OS/2"><a class="permalink" href="#OS/2">OS/2 or MS-DOS:</a></dt>
  <dd><span class="Li">set ZIPINFO=-l</span></dd>
  <dt id="VMS"><a class="permalink" href="#VMS">VMS (quotes for
    <i>lowercase</i>):</a></dt>
  <dd><span class="Li">define ZIPINFO_OPTS &quot;-l&quot;</span></dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">If, in addition, the user dislikes the trailer line,
    <i>zipinfo</i>'s concept of ``negative options'' may be used to override the
    default inclusion of the line. This is accomplished by preceding the
    undesired option with one or more minuses: e.g., ``-l-t'' or ``--tl'', in
    this example. The first hyphen is the regular switch character, but the one
    before the `t' is a minus sign. The dual use of hyphens may seem a little
    awkward, but it's reasonably intuitive nonetheless: simply ignore the first
    hyphen and go from there. It is also consistent with the behavior of the
    Unix command <i>nice</i>(1).</p>
<p class="Pp">As suggested above, the default variable names are ZIPINFO_OPTS
    for VMS (where the symbol used to install <i>zipinfo</i> as a foreign
    command would otherwise be confused with the environment variable), and
    ZIPINFO for all other operating systems. For compatibility with
    <i>zip</i>(1L), ZIPINFOOPT is also accepted (don't ask). If both ZIPINFO and
    ZIPINFOOPT are defined, however, ZIPINFO takes precedence. <i>unzip</i>'s
    diagnostic option (<b>-v</b> with no zipfile name) can be used to check the
    values of all four possible <i>unzip</i> and <i>zipinfo</i> environment
    variables.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="EXAMPLES"><a class="permalink" href="#EXAMPLES">EXAMPLES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">To get a basic, short-format listing of the complete contents of a
    ZIP archive <i>storage.zip</i>, with both header and totals lines, use only
    the archive name as an argument to zipinfo:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>zipinfo storage
</pre>
<p class="Pp">To produce a basic, long-format listing (not verbose), including
    header and totals lines, use <b>-l</b>:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>zipinfo -l storage
</pre>
<p class="Pp">To list the complete contents of the archive without header and
    totals lines, either negate the <b>-h</b> and <b>-t</b> options or else
    specify the contents explicitly:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>zipinfo --h-t storage
zipinfo storage \*
</pre>
<p class="Pp">(where the backslash is required only if the shell would otherwise
    expand the `*' wildcard, as in Unix when globbing is turned on--double
    quotes around the asterisk would have worked as well). To turn off the
    totals line by default, use the environment variable (C shell is assumed
    here):</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>setenv ZIPINFO --t
zipinfo storage
</pre>
<p class="Pp">To get the full, short-format listing of the first example again,
    given that the environment variable is set as in the previous example, it is
    necessary to specify the <b>-s</b> option explicitly, since the <b>-t</b>
    option by itself implies that ONLY the footer line is to be printed:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>setenv ZIPINFO --t
zipinfo -t storage            [only totals line]
zipinfo -st storage           [full listing]
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The <b>-s</b> option, like <b>-m</b> and <b>-l</b>, includes
    headers and footers by default, unless otherwise specified. Since the
    environment variable specified no footers and that has a higher precedence
    than the default behavior of <b>-s</b>, an explicit <b>-t</b> option was
    necessary to produce the full listing. Nothing was indicated about the
    header, however, so the <b>-s</b> option was sufficient. Note that both the
    <b>-h</b> and <b>-t</b> options, when used by themselves or with each other,
    override any default listing of member files; only the header and/or footer
    are printed. This behavior is useful when <i>zipinfo</i> is used with a
    wildcard zipfile specification; the contents of all zipfiles are then
    summarized with a single command.</p>
<p class="Pp">To list information on a single file within the archive, in medium
    format, specify the filename explicitly:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>zipinfo -m storage unshrink.c
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The specification of any member file, as in this example, will
    override the default header and totals lines; only the single line of
    information about the requested file will be printed. This is intuitively
    what one would expect when requesting information about a single file. For
    multiple files, it is often useful to know the total compressed and
    uncompressed size; in such cases <b>-t</b> may be specified explicitly:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>zipinfo -mt storage &quot;*.[ch]&quot; Mak\*
</pre>
<p class="Pp">To get maximal information about the ZIP archive, use the verbose
    option. It is usually wise to pipe the output into a filter such as Unix
    <i>more</i>(1) if the operating system allows it:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>zipinfo -v storage | more
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Finally, to see the most recently modified files in the archive,
    use the <b>-T</b> option in conjunction with an external sorting utility
    such as Unix <i>sort</i>(1) (and <i>sed</i>(1) as well, in this
  example):</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>zipinfo -T storage | sort -nr -k 7 | sed 15q
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The <b>-nr</b> option to <i>sort</i>(1) tells it to sort
    numerically in reverse order rather than in textual order, and the
    <b>-k&#x00A0;7</b> option tells it to sort on the seventh field. This
    assumes the default short-listing format; if <b>-m</b> or <b>-l</b> is used,
    the proper <i>sort</i>(1) option would be <b>-k&#x00A0;8</b>. Older versions
    of <i>sort</i>(1) do not support the <b>-k</b> option, but you can use the
    traditional <b>+</b> option instead, e.g., <b>+6</b> instead of
    <b>-k&#x00A0;7</b>. The <i>sed</i>(1) command filters out all but the first
    15 lines of the listing. Future releases of <i>zipinfo</i> may incorporate
    date/time and filename sorting as built-in options.</p>

<p class="Pp">The author finds it convenient to define an alias <i>ii</i> for
    <i>zipinfo</i> on systems that allow aliases (or, on other systems,
    copy/rename the executable, create a link or create a command file with the
    name <i>ii</i>). The <i>ii</i> usage parallels the common <i>ll</i> alias
    for long listings in Unix, and the similarity between the outputs of the two
    commands was intentional.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="BUGS"><a class="permalink" href="#BUGS">BUGS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">As with <i>unzip</i>, <i>zipinfo</i>'s <b>-M</b> (``more'') option
    is overly simplistic in its handling of screen output; as noted above, it
    fails to detect the wrapping of long lines and may thereby cause lines at
    the top of the screen to be scrolled off before being read. <i>zipinfo</i>
    should detect and treat each occurrence of line-wrap as one additional line
    printed. This requires knowledge of the screen's width as well as its
    height. In addition, <i>zipinfo</i> should detect the true screen geometry
    on all systems.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>zipinfo</i>'s listing-format behavior is unnecessarily complex
    and should be simplified. (This is not to say that it will be.)</p>
