This document defines a standard generic interface to the dynamic linking
  mechanisms available on many platforms. Its primary purpose is to implement
  automatic dynamic loading of Perl modules.
<p class="Pp">This document serves as both a specification for anyone wishing to
    implement the DynaLoader for a new platform and as a guide for anyone
    wishing to use the DynaLoader directly in an application.</p>
<p class="Pp">The DynaLoader is designed to be a very simple high-level
    interface that is sufficiently general to cover the requirements of SunOS,
    HP-UX, Linux, VMS and other platforms.</p>
<p class="Pp">It is also hoped that the interface will cover the needs of OS/2,
    NT etc and also allow pseudo-dynamic linking (using
    <span class="Li">&quot;ld -A&quot;</span> at runtime).</p>
<p class="Pp">It must be stressed that the DynaLoader, by itself, is practically
    useless for accessing non-Perl libraries because it provides almost no
    Perl-to-C 'glue'. There is, for example, no mechanism for calling a C
    library function or supplying arguments. A C::DynaLib module is available
    from CPAN sites which performs that function for some common system types.
    And since the year 2000, there's also Inline::C, a module that allows you to
    write Perl subroutines in C. Also available from your local CPAN site.</p>

</pre>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>@dl_library_path</dt>
  <dd>The standard/default list of directories in which <b>dl_findfile()</b>
      will search for libraries etc. Directories are searched in order:
      <span class="Li">$dl_library_path</span>[0], [1], ... etc
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">@dl_library_path</span> is initialised to
        hold the list of 'normal' directories (<i>/usr/lib</i>, etc) determined
        by <b>Configure</b> (<span class="Li">$Config{'libpth'}</span>). This
        should ensure portability across a wide range of platforms.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">@dl_library_path</span> should also be
        initialised with any other directories that can be determined from the
        environment at runtime (such as LD_LIBRARY_PATH for SunOS).</p>
    <p class="Pp">After initialisation <span class="Li">@dl_library_path</span>
        can be manipulated by an application using push and unshift before
        calling <b>dl_findfile()</b>. Unshift can be used to add directories to
        the front of the search order either to save search time or to override
        libraries with the same name in the 'normal' directories.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The load function that <b>dl_load_file()</b> calls may require
        an absolute pathname. The <b>dl_findfile()</b> function and
        <span class="Li">@dl_library_path</span> can be used to search for and
        return the absolute pathname for the library/object that you wish to
        load.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>@dl_resolve_using</dt>
  <dd>A list of additional libraries or other shared objects which can be used
      to resolve any undefined symbols that might be generated by a later call
      to <b>load_file()</b>.
    <p class="Pp">This is only required on some platforms which do not handle
        dependent libraries automatically. For example the Socket Perl extension
        library (<i>auto/Socket/Socket.so</i>) contains references to many
        socket functions which need to be resolved when it's loaded. Most
        platforms will automatically know where to find the 'dependent' library
        (e.g., <i>/usr/lib/libsocket.so</i>). A few platforms need to be told
        the location of the dependent library explicitly. Use
        <span class="Li">@dl_resolve_using</span> for this.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Example usage:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    @dl_resolve_using = dl_findfile('-lsocket');
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>@dl_require_symbols</dt>
  <dd>A list of one or more symbol names that are in the library/object file to
      be dynamically loaded. This is only required on some platforms.</dd>
  <dt>@dl_librefs</dt>
  <dd>An array of the handles returned by successful calls to
      <b>dl_load_file()</b>, made by bootstrap, in the order in which they were
      loaded. Can be used with <b>dl_find_symbol()</b> to look for a symbol in
      any of the loaded files.</dd>
  <dt>@dl_modules</dt>
  <dd>An array of module (package) names that have been bootstrap'ed.</dd>
  <dt>@dl_shared_objects</dt>
  <dd>An array of file names for the shared objects that were loaded.</dd>
  <dt><b>dl_error()</b></dt>
  <dd>Syntax:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    $message = dl_error();
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Error message text from the last failed DynaLoader function.
        Note that, similar to errno in unix, a successful function call does not
        reset this message.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Implementations should detect the error as soon as it occurs
        in any of the other functions and save the corresponding message for
        later retrieval. This will avoid problems on some platforms (such as
        SunOS) where the error message is very temporary (e.g.,
        <b>dlerror()</b>).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>$dl_debug</dt>
  <dd>Internal debugging messages are enabled when
      <span class="Li">$dl_debug</span> is set true. Currently setting
      <span class="Li">$dl_debug</span> only affects the Perl side of the
      DynaLoader. These messages should help an application developer to resolve
      any DynaLoader usage problems.
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">$dl_debug</span> is set to
        <span class="Li">$ENV{'PERL_DL_DEBUG'}</span> if defined.</p>
    <p class="Pp">For the DynaLoader developer/porter there is a similar
        debugging variable added to the C code (see dlutils.c) and enabled if
        Perl was built with the <b>-DDEBUGGING</b> flag. This can also be set
        via the PERL_DL_DEBUG environment variable. Set to 1 for minimal
        information or higher for more.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>$dl_dlext</dt>
  <dd>When specified (localised) in a module's <i>.pm</i> file, indicates the
      extension which the module's loadable object will have. For example:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    local $DynaLoader::dl_dlext = 'unusual_ext';
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">would indicate that the module's loadable object has an
        extension of <span class="Li">&quot;unusual_ext&quot;</span> instead of
        the more usual <span class="Li">$Config{dlext}</span>. NOTE: This also
        requires that the module's <i>Makefile.PL</i> specify (in
        <span class="Li">&quot;WriteMakefile()&quot;</span>):</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    DLEXT =&gt; 'unusual_ext',

  <dd>Syntax:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    @filepaths = dl_findfile(@names)
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Determine the full paths (including file suffix) of one or
        more loadable files given their generic names and optionally one or more
        directories. Searches directories in
        <span class="Li">@dl_library_path</span> by default and returns an empty
        list if no files were found.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Names can be specified in a variety of platform independent
        forms. Any names in the form <b>-lname</b> are converted into
        <i>libname.*</i>, where <i>.*</i> is an appropriate suffix for the
        platform.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If a name does not already have a suitable prefix and/or
        suffix then the corresponding file will be searched for by trying
        combinations of prefix and suffix appropriate to the platform:
        &quot;$name.o&quot;, &quot;lib$name.*&quot; and &quot;$name&quot;.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If any directories are included in
        <span class="Li">@names</span> they are searched before
        <span class="Li">@dl_library_path</span>. Directories may be specified
        as <b>-Ldir</b>. Any other names are treated as filenames to be searched
        for.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Using arguments of the form
        <span class="Li">&quot;-Ldir&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;-lname&quot;</span> is recommended.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Example:</p>

    <pre>
    $filepath = dl_expandspec($spec)
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Some unusual systems, such as VMS, require special filename
        handling in order to deal with symbolic names for files (i.e., VMS's
        Logical Names).</p>
    <p class="Pp">To support these systems a <b>dl_expandspec()</b> function can
        be implemented either in the <i>dl_*.xs</i> file or code can be added to
        the <b>dl_expandspec()</b> function in <i>DynaLoader.pm</i>. See

    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Dynamically unload <span class="Li">$libref</span>, which must

        one on success and zero on failure. This function is optional and may
        not necessarily be provided on all platforms.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If it is defined and perl is compiled with the C macro
        <span class="Li">&quot;DL_UNLOAD_ALL_AT_EXIT&quot;</span> defined, then
        it is called automatically when the interpreter exits for every shared
        object or library loaded by DynaLoader::bootstrap. All such library
        references are stored in <span class="Li">@dl_librefs</span> by
        DynaLoader::Bootstrap as it loads the libraries. The files are unloaded
        in last-in, first-out order.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This unloading is usually necessary when embedding a
        shared-object perl (e.g. one configured with -Duseshrplib) within a
        larger application, and the perl interpreter is created and destroyed
        several times within the lifetime of the application. In this case it is
        possible that the system dynamic linker will unload and then
        subsequently reload the shared libperl without relocating any references
        to it from any files DynaLoaded by the previous incarnation of the
        interpreter. As a result, any shared objects opened by DynaLoader may
        point to a now invalid 'ghost' of the libperl shared object, causing
        apparently random memory corruption and crashes. This behaviour is most
        commonly seen when using Apache and mod_perl built with the APXS
