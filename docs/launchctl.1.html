<p class="Pp"><code class="Nm">launchctl</code> allows for detailed examination
    of <code class="Nm">launchd</code>'s data structures. The fundamental
    structures are domains, services, and endpoints. A domain manages the
    execution policy for a collection of services. A service may be thought of
    as a virtual process that is always available to be spawned in response to
    demand. Each service has a collection of endpoints, and sending a message to
    one of those endpoints will cause the service to launch on demand. Domains
    advertise these endpoints in a shared namespace and may be thought of as
    synonymous with Mach bootstrap subsets.</p>
<p class="Pp">Many subcommands in <code class="Nm">launchctl</code> take a
    specifier which indicates the target domain or service for the subcommand.
    This specifier may take one of the following forms:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><var class="Ar">system/[service-name]</var></dt>
  <dd>Targets the system domain or a service within the system domain. The
      system domain manages the root Mach bootstrap and is considered a
      privileged execution context. Anyone may read or query the system domain,
      but root privileges are required to make modifications.</dd>
  <dt><var class="Ar">user/&lt;uid&gt;/[service-name]</var></dt>
  <dd>Targets the user domain for the given UID or a service within that domain.
      A user domain may exist independently of a logged-in user. User domains do
      not exist on iOS.</dd>
  <dt><var class="Ar">login/&lt;asid&gt;/[service-name]</var></dt>
  <dd>Targets a user-login domain or service within that domain. A user-login
      domain is created when the user logs in at the GUI and is identified by
      the audit session identifier associated with that login. If a user domain
      has an associated login domain, the <code class="Nm">print</code>
      subcommand will display the ASID of that login domain. User-login domains
      do not exist on iOS.</dd>
  <dt><var class="Ar">gui/&lt;uid&gt;/[service-name]</var></dt>
  <dd>Another form of the <code class="Nm">login</code> specifier. Rather than
      specifying a user-login domain by its ASID, this specifier targets the
      domain based on which user it is associated with and is generally more
      convenient.
    <p class="Pp" id="Note"><a class="permalink" href="#Note"><i class="Em">Note</i></a>:
        GUI domains and user domains share many resources. For the purposes of
        the Mach bootstrap name lookups, they are &quot;flat&quot;, so they
        share the same set of registered names. But they still have discrete
        sets of services. So when printing the user domain's contents, you may
        see many Mach bootstrap name registrations from services that exist in
        the GUI domain for that user, but you will not see the services
        themselves in that list.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><var class="Ar">pid/&lt;pid&gt;/[service-name]</var></dt>
  <dd>Targets the domain for the given PID or a service within that domain. Each
      process on the system will have a PID domain associated with it that
      consists of the XPC services visible to that process which can be reached
      with <a class="Xr">xpc_connection_create(3)</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">For instance, when referring to a service with the identifier
    <code class="Nm">com.apple.example</code> loaded into the GUI domain of a
    user with UID 501, <code class="Nm">domain-target</code> is
    <code class="Nm">gui/501/</code>, <code class="Nm">service-name</code> is
    <code class="Nm">com.apple.example</code>, and
    <code class="Nm">service-target</code> is
    <code class="Nm">gui/501/com.apple.example</code>.</p>

  <dd>Bootstraps or removes domains and services. When service arguments are
      present, bootstraps and correspondingly removes their definitions into the
      domain. Services may be specified as a series of paths or a service
      identifier. Paths may point to XPC service bundles,
      <a class="Xr">launchd.plist(5)</a> s, or a directories containing a
      collection of either. If there were one or more errors while bootstrapping
      or removing a collection of services, the problematic paths will be

    <p class="Pp">If no paths or service target are specified, these commands
