<p class="Pp">Without backups this would result in loss of data if there was an

<p class="Pp">This has changed so that the input file isn't replaced until the

On platforms where inode numbers are of a type larger than perl's native integer
  numerical types, stat will preserve the full content of large inode numbers by
  returning them in the form of strings of decimal digits. Exact comparison of
  inode numbers can thus be achieved by comparing with
  <span class="Li">&quot;eq&quot;</span> rather than
  <span class="Li">&quot;==&quot;</span>. Comparison with
  <span class="Li">&quot;==&quot;</span>, and other numerical operations (which
  are usually meaningless on inode numbers), work as well as they did before,
  which is to say they fall back to floating point, and ultimately operate on a
  fairly useless rounded inode number if the real inode number is too big for
  the floating point format.

When opening a file descriptor, perl now generally opens it with its
  close-on-exec flag already set, on platforms that support doing so. This
  improves thread safety, because it means that an
  <span class="Li">&quot;exec&quot;</span> initiated by one thread can no longer
  cause a file descriptor in the process of being opened by another thread to be
  accidentally passed to the executed program.
<p class="Pp">Additionally, perl now sets the close-on-exec flag more reliably,
    whether it does so atomically or not. Most file descriptors were getting the
    flag set, but some were being missed.</p>

The new string-specific (<span class="Li">&quot;&amp;. |. ^. ~.&quot;</span>)
  and number-specific (<span class="Li">&quot;&amp; | ^ ~&quot;</span>) bitwise
  operators introduced in Perl 5.22 that are available within the scope of
  <span class="Li">&quot;use feature 'bitwise'&quot;</span> are no longer
  experimental. Because the number-specific ops are spelled the same way as the
  existing operators that choose their behaviour based on their operands, these
  operators must still be enabled via the &quot;bitwise&quot; feature, in either
  of these two ways:
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    use feature &quot;bitwise&quot;;

    use v5.28; # &quot;bitwise&quot; now included
</pre>
<p class="Pp">They are also now enabled by the <b>-E</b> command-line
  switch.</p>
<p class="Pp">The &quot;bitwise&quot; feature no longer emits a warning.
    Existing code that disables the &quot;experimental::bitwise&quot; warning
    category that the feature previously used will continue to work.</p>
<p class="Pp">One caveat that module authors ought to be aware of is that the
    numeric operators now pass a fifth TRUE argument to overload methods. Any
    methods that check the number of operands may croak if they do not expect so
    many. XS authors in particular should be aware that this:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>

  Hash Function Change</a></h2>
Perl 5.28.0 retires various older hash functions which are not viewed as
  sufficiently secure for use in Perl. We now support four general purpose hash
  functions, Siphash (2-4 and 1-3 variants), and Zaphod32, and StadtX hash. In
  addition we support SBOX32 (a form of tabular hashing) for hashing short
  strings, in conjunction with any of the other hash functions provided.
<p class="Pp">By default Perl is configured to support SBOX hashing of strings
    up to 24 characters, in conjunction with StadtX hashing on 64 bit builds,
    and Zaphod32 hashing for 32 bit builds.</p>
<p class="Pp">You may control these settings with the following options to
    Configure:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    -DPERL_HASH_FUNC_SIPHASH
    -DPERL_HASH_FUNC_SIPHASH13

  algorithm can no longer be specified</a></h2>
Since Perl 5.8, the sort pragma has had subpragmata
  <span class="Li">&quot;_mergesort&quot;</span>,
  <span class="Li">&quot;_quicksort&quot;</span>, and
  <span class="Li">&quot;_qsort&quot;</span> that can be used to specify which
  algorithm perl should use to implement the sort builtin. This was always
  considered a dubious feature that might not last, hence the underscore
  spellings, and they were documented as not being portable beyond Perl 5.8.
  These subpragmata have now been deleted, and any attempt to use them is an
  error. The sort pragma otherwise remains, and the algorithm-neutral
  <span class="Li">&quot;stable&quot;</span> subpragma can be used to control
  sorting behaviour. [perl #119635]

Octal and binary floating point literals used to permit any hexadecimal digit to

Perl 5.26.0 fatalized some uses of an unescaped left brace, but an exception was
  made at the last minute, specifically crafted to be a minimal change to allow
  GNU Autoconf to work. That tool is heavily depended upon, and continues to use
  the deprecated usage. Its use of an unescaped left brace is one where we have
  no intention of repurposing <span class="Li">&quot;{&quot;</span> to be
  something other than itself.
<p class="Pp">That exception is now generalized to include various other such

Using unescaped left braces is officially deprecated everywhere, but it is not
  enforced in contexts where their use does not interfere with expected
  extensions to the language. A deprecation is added in this release when the
  brace appears immediately after an opening parenthesis. Before this, even if
  the brace was part of a legal quantifier, it was not interpreted as such, but
  as the literal characters, unlike other quantifiers that follow a
  <span class="Li">&quot;(&quot;</span> which are considered errors. Now, their
  use will raise a deprecation message, unless turned off.

  removals</a></h2>
The following modules will be removed from the core distribution in a future
  release, and will at that time need to be installed from CPAN. Distributions
  on CPAN which require these modules will need to list them as prerequisites.
<p class="Pp">The core versions of these modules will now issue
    <span class="Li">&quot;deprecated&quot;</span>-category warnings to alert
    you to this fact. To silence these deprecation warnings, install the modules
    in question from CPAN.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that these are (with rare exceptions) fine modules that you
    are encouraged to continue to use. Their disinclusion from core primarily
    hinges on their necessity to bootstrapping a fully functional, CPAN-capable
    Perl installation, not usually on concerns over their design.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="Performance_Enhancements"><a class="permalink" href="#Performance_Enhancements">Performance
  Enhancements</a></h1>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>The start up overhead for creating regular expression patterns with
      Unicode properties (<span class="Li">&quot;\p{...}&quot;</span>) has been
      greatly reduced in most cases.</li>
  <li>Many string concatenation expressions are now considerably faster, due to
      the introduction internally of a
      <span class="Li">&quot;multiconcat&quot;</span> opcode which combines
      multiple concatenations, and optionally a
      <span class="Li">&quot;=&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;.=&quot;</span>, into a single action. For example,
      apart from retrieving <span class="Li">$s</span>,
      <span class="Li">$a</span> and <span class="Li">$b</span>, this whole
      expression is now handled as a single op:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    $s .= &quot;a=$a b=$b\n&quot;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">As a special case, if the LHS of an assignment is a lexical
        variable or <span class="Li">&quot;my $s&quot;</span>, the op itself
        handles retrieving the lexical variable, which is faster.</p>
    <p class="Pp">In general, the more the expression includes a mix of constant
        strings and variable expressions, the longer the expression, and the
        more it mixes together non-utf8 and utf8 strings, the more marked the
        performance improvement. For example on a
        <span class="Li">&quot;x86_64&quot;</span> system, this code has been
        benchmarked running four times faster:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    my $s;
    my $a = &quot;ab\x{100}cde&quot;;
    my $b = &quot;fghij&quot;;
    my $c = &quot;\x{101}klmn&quot;;

    for my $i (1..10_000_000) {
        $s = &quot;\x{100}wxyz&quot;;
        $s .= &quot;foo=$a bar=$b baz=$c&quot;;
    }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">In addition, <span class="Li">&quot;sprintf&quot;</span>
        expressions which have a constant format containing only
        <span class="Li">%s</span> and <span class="Li">&quot;%%&quot;</span>
        format elements, and which have a fixed number of arguments, are now
        also optimised into a <span class="Li">&quot;multiconcat&quot;</span>
        op.</p>
  </li>
  <li>The <span class="Li">&quot;ref()&quot;</span> builtin is now much faster
      in boolean context, since it no longer bothers to construct a temporary
      string like <span class="Li">&quot;Foo=ARRAY(0x134af48)&quot;</span>.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;keys()&quot;</span> in void and scalar contexts is
      now more efficient.</li>
  <li>The common idiom of comparing the result of <b>index()</b> with -1 is now
      specifically optimised, e.g.
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    if (index(...) != -1) { ... }
    </pre>
  </li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;for()&quot;</span> loops and similar constructs are
      now more efficient in most cases.</li>
  <li>File::Glob has been modified to remove unnecessary backtracking and
      recursion, thanks to Russ Cox. See &lt;https://research.swtch.com/glob&gt;
      for more details.</li>
  <li>The XS-level <span class="Li">&quot;SvTRUE()&quot;</span> API function is
      now more efficient.</li>
  <li>Various integer-returning ops are now more efficient in scalar/boolean
      context.</li>
  <li>Slightly improved performance when parsing stash names. [perl #129990]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=129990&gt;</li>
  <li>Calls to <span class="Li">&quot;require&quot;</span> for an already loaded
      module are now slightly faster. [perl #132171]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=132171&gt;</li>
  <li>The performance of pattern matching
      <span class="Li">&quot;[[:ascii:]]&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;[[:^ascii:]]&quot;</span> has been improved
      significantly except on EBCDIC platforms.</li>
  <li>Various optimizations have been applied to matching regular expression
      patterns, so under the right circumstances, significant performance gains
      may be noticed. But in an application with many varied patterns, little
      overall improvement likely will be seen.</li>
  <li>Other optimizations have been applied to UTF-8 handling, but these are not
      typically a major factor in most applications.</li>

The usage of <span class="Li">&quot;use vars&quot;</span> has been discouraged
  since the introduction of <span class="Li">&quot;our&quot;</span> in Perl
  5.6.0. Where possible the usage of this pragma has now been removed from the
  Perl source code.
<p class="Pp">This had a slight effect (for the better) on the output of

XSLoader is more modern, and most modules already require perl 5.6 or greater,
  so no functionality is lost by switching. In some cases, we have also made
  changes to the local implementation that may not be reflected in the version
  on CPAN due to a desire to maintain more backwards compatibility.

  <li>B::Deparse has been upgraded from version 1.40 to 1.48.

  <li>bytes has been upgraded from version 1.05 to 1.06.</li>
  <li>Carp has been upgraded from version 1.42 to 1.50.
    <p class="Pp">If a package on the call stack contains a constant named
        <span class="Li">&quot;ISA&quot;</span>, Carp no longer throws a
        &quot;Not a GLOB reference&quot; error.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Carp, when generating stack traces, now attempts to work

        stack. [perl #52610]
        &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=52610&gt;</p>
    <p class="Pp">Carp has been modified to avoid assuming that objects cannot
        be overloaded without the overload module loaded (this can happen with
        objects created by XS modules). Previously, infinite recursion would
        result if an XS-defined overload method itself called Carp. [perl
        #132828] &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=132828&gt;</p>
    <p class="Pp">Carp now avoids using
        <span class="Li">&quot;overload::StrVal&quot;</span>, partly because
        older versions of overload (included with perl 5.14 and earlier) load
        Scalar::Util at run time, which will fail if Carp has been invoked after
        a syntax error.</p>

    <p class="Pp">Devel::PPPort has moved from cpan-first to perl-first
        maintenance</p>
    <p class="Pp">Primary responsibility for the code in Devel::PPPort has moved
        into core perl. In a practical sense there should be no change except
        that hopefully it will stay more up to date with changes made to symbols

  <li>C89 requirement
    <p class="Pp">Perl has been documented as requiring a C89 compiler to build
        since October 1998. A variety of simplifications have now been made to
        Perl's internals to rely on the features specified by the C89 standard.
        We believe that this internal change hasn't altered the set of platforms
        that Perl builds on, but please report a bug if Perl now has new
        problems building on your platform.</p>
  </li>
  <li>On GCC, <span class="Li">&quot;-Werror=pointer-arith&quot;</span> is now
      enabled by default, disallowing arithmetic on void and function
    pointers.</li>
  <li>Where an HTML version of the documentation is installed, the HTML
      documents now use relative links to refer to each other. Links from the
      index page of perlipc to the individual section documents are now correct.

  <li><i>lib/unicore/mktables</i> now correctly canonicalizes the names of the
      dependencies stored in the files it generates.
    <p class="Pp"><i>regen/mk_invlists.pl</i>, unlike the other
        <i>regen/*.pl</i> scripts, used <span class="Li">$0</span> to name
        itself in the dependencies stored in the files it generates. It now uses
        a literal so that the path stored in the generated files doesn't depend
        on how <i>regen/mk_invlists.pl</i> is invoked.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This lack of canonical names could cause test failures in
        <i>t/porting/regen.t</i>. [perl #132925]

<h1 class="Sh" id="Packaging"><a class="permalink" href="#Packaging">Packaging</a></h1>
For the past few years we have released perl using three different archive
  formats: bzip (<span class="Li">&quot;.bz2&quot;</span>), LZMA2
  (<span class="Li">&quot;.xz&quot;</span>) and gzip
  (<span class="Li">&quot;.gz&quot;</span>). Since xz compresses better and
  decompresses faster, and gzip is more compatible and uses less memory, we have
  dropped the <span class="Li">&quot;.bz2&quot;</span> archive format with this
  release. (If this poses a problem, do let us know; see &quot;Reporting
  Bugs&quot;, below.)

  Changes</a></h1>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>A new optimisation phase has been added to the compiler,
      <span class="Li">&quot;optimize_optree()&quot;</span>, which does a
      top-down scan of a complete optree just before the peephole optimiser is
      run. This phase is not currently hookable.</li>
  <li>An <span class="Li">&quot;OP_MULTICONCAT&quot;</span> op has been added.
      At <span class="Li">&quot;optimize_optree()&quot;</span> time, a chain of
      <span class="Li">&quot;OP_CONCAT&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;OP_CONST&quot;</span> ops, together optionally with
      an <span class="Li">&quot;OP_STRINGIFY&quot;</span> and/or
      <span class="Li">&quot;OP_SASSIGN&quot;</span>, are combined into a single
      <span class="Li">&quot;OP_MULTICONCAT&quot;</span> op. The op is of type
      <span class="Li">&quot;UNOP_AUX&quot;</span>, and the aux array contains
      the argument count, plus a pointer to a constant string and a set of
      segment lengths. For example with
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    my $x = &quot;foo=$foo, bar=$bar\n&quot;;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">the constant string would be <span class="Li">&quot;foo=,
        bar=\n&quot;</span> and the segment lengths would be (4,6,1). If the
        string contains characters such as
        <span class="Li">&quot;\x80&quot;</span>, whose representation changes
        under utf8, two sets of strings plus lengths are precomputed and
      stored.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Direct access to <span class="Li">&quot;PL_keyword_plugin&quot;</span> is
      not safe in the presence of multithreading. A new
      <span class="Li">&quot;wrap_keyword_plugin&quot;</span> function has been
      added to allow XS modules to safely define custom keywords even when
      loaded from a thread, analogous to
      <span class="Li">&quot;PL_check&quot;</span> /
      <span class="Li">&quot;wrap_op_checker&quot;</span>.</li>
  <li>The <span class="Li">&quot;PL_statbuf&quot;</span> interpreter variable
      has been removed.</li>
  <li>The deprecated function
      <span class="Li">&quot;to_utf8_case()&quot;</span>, accessible from XS
      code, has been removed.</li>
  <li>A new function
      <span class="Li">&quot;is_utf8_invariant_string_loc()&quot;</span> has
      been added that is like
      <span class="Li">&quot;is_utf8_invariant_string()&quot;</span> but takes
      an extra pointer parameter into which is stored the location of the first
      variant character, if any are found.</li>
  <li>A new function, <span class="Li">&quot;Perl_langinfo()&quot;</span> has
      been added. It is an (almost) drop-in replacement for the system
      <span class="Li">nl_langinfo(3)</span>, but works on platforms that lack
      that; as well as being more thread-safe, and hiding some gotchas with
      locale handling from the caller. Code that uses this, needn't use
      <span class="Li">localeconv(3)</span> (and be affected by the gotchas) to
      find the decimal point, thousands separator, or currency symbol. See
      &quot;Perl_langinfo&quot; in perlapi.</li>
  <li>A new API function <span class="Li">&quot;sv_rvunweaken()&quot;</span> has
      been added to complement
      <span class="Li">&quot;sv_rvweaken()&quot;</span>. The implementation was
      taken from &quot;unweaken&quot; in Scalar::Util.</li>
  <li>A new flag, <span class="Li">&quot;SORTf_UNSTABLE&quot;</span>, has been
      added. This will allow a future commit to make mergesort unstable when the
      user specifies Xno sort stableX, since it has been decided that mergesort
      should remain stable by default.</li>
  <li>XS modules can now automatically get reentrant versions of system
      functions on threaded perls.
    <p class="Pp">By adding</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    #define PERL_REENTRANT
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">near the beginning of an
        <span class="Li">&quot;XS&quot;</span> file, it will be compiled so that
        whatever reentrant functions perl knows about on that system will
        automatically and invisibly be used instead of the plain, non-reentrant
        versions. For example, if you write
        <span class="Li">&quot;getpwnam()&quot;</span> in your code, on a system
        that has <span class="Li">&quot;getpwnam_r()&quot;</span> all calls to
        the former will be translated invisibly into the latter. This does not
        happen except on threaded perls, as they aren't needed otherwise. Be
        aware that which functions have reentrant versions varies from system to
        system.</p>
  </li>
  <li>The <span class="Li">&quot;PERL_NO_OP_PARENT&quot;</span> build define is
      no longer supported, which means that perl is now always built with
      <span class="Li">&quot;PERL_OP_PARENT&quot;</span> enabled.</li>
  <li>The format and content of the non-utf8 transliteration table attached to
      the <span class="Li">&quot;op_pv&quot;</span> field of
      <span class="Li">&quot;OP_TRANS&quot;</span>/<span class="Li">&quot;OP_TRANSR&quot;</span>
      ops has changed. It's now a <span class="Li">&quot;struct
      OPtrans_map&quot;</span>.</li>
  <li>A new compiler <span class="Li">&quot;#define&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;dTHX_DEBUGGING&quot;</span>. has been added. This
      is useful for XS or C code that only need the thread context because their
      debugging statements that get compiled only under
      <span class="Li">&quot;-DDEBUGGING&quot;</span> need one.</li>
  <li>A new API function &quot;Perl_setlocale&quot; in perlapi has been
    added.</li>
  <li>&quot;sync_locale&quot; in perlapi has been revised to return a boolean as
      to whether the system was using the global locale or not.</li>
  <li>A new kind of magic scalar, called a &quot;nonelem&quot; scalar, has been
      introduced. It is stored in an array to denote a non-existent element,
      whenever such an element is accessed in a potential lvalue context. It
      replaces the existing &quot;defelem&quot; (deferred element) magic
      wherever this is possible, being significantly more efficient. This means
      that <span class="Li">&quot;some_sub($sparse_array[$nonelem])&quot;</span>
      no longer has to create a new magic defelem scalar each time, as long as
      the element is within the array.
    <p class="Pp">It partially fixes the rare bug of deferred elements getting
        out of synch with their arrays when the array is shifted or unshifted.

<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>List assignment (<span class="Li">&quot;aassign&quot;</span>) could in
      some rare cases allocate an entry on the mortals stack and leave the entry
      uninitialized, leading to possible crashes. [perl #131570]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=131570&gt;</li>
  <li>Attempting to apply an attribute to an
      <span class="Li">&quot;our&quot;</span> variable where a function of that
      name already exists could result in a NULL pointer being supplied where an
      SV was expected, crashing perl. [perl #131597]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=131597&gt;</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;split ' '&quot;</span> now correctly handles the
      argument being split when in the scope of the
      <span class="Li">&quot;unicode_strings&quot;</span> feature. Previously,
      when a string using the single-byte internal representation contained
      characters that are whitespace by Unicode rules but not by ASCII rules, it
      treated those characters as part of fields rather than as field
      separators. [perl #130907]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=130907&gt;</li>
  <li>Several built-in functions previously had bugs that could cause them to
      write to the internal stack without allocating room for the item being
      written. In rare situations, this could have led to a crash. These bugs
      have now been fixed, and if any similar bugs are introduced in future,
      they will be detected automatically in debugging builds.
    <p class="Pp">These internal stack usage checks introduced are also done by
        the <span class="Li">&quot;entersub&quot;</span> operator when calling
        XSUBs. This means we can report which XSUB failed to allocate enough
        stack space. [perl #131975]
        &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=131975&gt;</p>
  </li>
  <li>Using a symbolic ref with postderef syntax as the key in a hash lookup was
      yielding an assertion failure on debugging builds. [perl #131627]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=131627&gt;</li>
  <li>Array and hash variables whose names begin with a caret now admit indexing
      inside their curlies when interpolated into strings, as in
      <span class="Li">&quot;${^CAPTURE[0]}&quot;</span> to index
      <span class="Li">&quot;@{^CAPTURE}&quot;</span>. [perl #131664]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=131664&gt;</li>
  <li>Fetching the name of a glob that was previously UTF-8 but wasn't any
      longer would return that name flagged as UTF-8. [perl #131263]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=131263&gt;</li>
  <li>The perl <span class="Li">&quot;sprintf()&quot;</span> function (via the
      underlying C function
      <span class="Li">&quot;Perl_sv_vcatpvfn_flags()&quot;</span>) has been
      heavily reworked to fix many minor bugs, including the integer wrapping of
      large width and precision specifiers and potential buffer overruns. It has
      also been made faster in many cases.</li>
  <li>Exiting from an <span class="Li">&quot;eval&quot;</span>, whether normally
      or via an exception, now always frees temporary values (possibly calling
      destructors) <i>before</i> setting <span class="Li">$@</span>. For
      example:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    sub DESTROY { eval { die &quot;died in DESTROY&quot;; } }
    eval { bless []; };
    # $@ used to be equal to &quot;died in DESTROY&quot; here; it's now &quot;&quot;.
    </pre>
  </li>
  <li>Fixed a duplicate symbol failure with <span class="Li">&quot;-flto
      -mieee-fp&quot;</span> builds. <i>pp.c</i> defined
      <span class="Li">&quot;_LIB_VERSION&quot;</span> which
      <span class="Li">&quot;-lieee&quot;</span> already defines. [perl #131786]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=131786&gt;</li>
  <li>The tokenizer no longer consumes the exponent part of a floating point
      number if it's incomplete. [perl #131725]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=131725&gt;</li>
  <li>On non-threaded builds, for <span class="Li">&quot;m/$null/&quot;</span>
      where <span class="Li">$null</span> is an empty string is no longer
      treated as if the <span class="Li">&quot;/o&quot;</span> flag was present
      when the previous matching match operator included the
      <span class="Li">&quot;/o&quot;</span> flag. The rewriting used to
      implement this behavior could confuse the interpreter. This matches the
      behaviour of threaded builds. [perl #124368]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=124368&gt;</li>
  <li>Parsing a <span class="Li">&quot;sub&quot;</span> definition could cause a
      use after free if the <span class="Li">&quot;sub&quot;</span> keyword was
      followed by whitespace including newlines (and comments.) [perl #131836]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=131836&gt;</li>
  <li>The tokenizer now correctly adjusts a parse pointer when skipping
      whitespace in a <span class="Li">&quot;${identifier}&quot;</span>
      construct. [perl #131949]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=131949&gt;</li>
  <li>Accesses to <span class="Li">&quot;${^LAST_FH}&quot;</span> no longer
      assert after using any of a variety of I/O operations on a non-glob. [perl
      #128263]
    &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=128263&gt;</li>
  <li>The XS-level <span class="Li">&quot;Copy()&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;Move()&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;Zero()&quot;</span> macros and their variants now
      assert if the pointers supplied are
      <span class="Li">&quot;NULL&quot;</span>. ISO C considers supplying NULL
      pointers to the functions these macros are built upon as undefined
      behaviour even when their count parameters are zero. Based on these
      assertions and the original bug report three macro calls were made
      conditional. [perl #131746]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=131746&gt; [perl
      #131892]
    &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=131892&gt;</li>
  <li>Only the <span class="Li">&quot;=&quot;</span> operator is permitted for
      defining defaults for parameters in subroutine signatures. Previously
      other assignment operators, e.g. <span class="Li">&quot;+=&quot;</span>,
      were also accidentally permitted. [perl #131777]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=131777&gt;</li>
  <li>Package names are now always included in
      <span class="Li">&quot;:prototype&quot;</span> warnings [perl #131833]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=131833&gt;</li>
  <li>The <span class="Li">&quot;je_old_stack_hwm&quot;</span> field, previously
      only found in the <span class="Li">&quot;jmpenv&quot;</span> structure on
      debugging builds, has been added to non-debug builds as well. This fixes
      an issue with some CPAN modules caused by the size of this structure
      varying between debugging and non-debugging builds. [perl #131942]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=131942&gt;</li>
  <li>The arguments to the <span class="Li">&quot;ninstr()&quot;</span> macro
      are now correctly parenthesized.</li>
  <li>A NULL pointer dereference in the
      <span class="Li">&quot;S_regmatch()&quot;</span> function has been fixed.
      [perl #132017]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=132017&gt;</li>
  <li>Calling exec PROGRAM LIST with an empty
      <span class="Li">&quot;LIST&quot;</span> has been fixed. This should call
      <span class="Li">&quot;execvp()&quot;</span> with an empty
      <span class="Li">&quot;argv&quot;</span> array (containing only the
      terminating <span class="Li">&quot;NULL&quot;</span> pointer), but was
      instead just returning false (and not setting <span class="Li">$!</span>).
      [perl #131730]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=131730&gt;</li>
  <li>The <span class="Li">&quot;gv_fetchmeth_sv&quot;</span> C function stopped
      working properly in Perl 5.22 when fetching a constant with a UTF-8 name
      if that constant subroutine was stored in the stash as a simple scalar
      reference, rather than a full typeglob. This has been corrected.</li>
  <li>Single-letter debugger commands followed by an argument which starts with
      punctuation (e.g. <span class="Li">&quot;p$^V&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;x@ARGV&quot;</span>) now work again. They had been
      wrongly requiring a space between the command and the argument. [perl
      #120174]
    &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=120174&gt;</li>
  <li>splice now throws an exception (&quot;Modification of a read-only value
      attempted&quot;) when modifying a read-only array. Until now it had been
      silently modifying the array. The new behaviour is consistent with the
      behaviour of push and unshift. [perl #131000]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=131000&gt;</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;stat()&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;lstat()&quot;</span>, and file test operators now
      fail if given a filename containing a nul character, in the same way that
      <span class="Li">&quot;open()&quot;</span> already fails.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;stat()&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;lstat()&quot;</span>, and file test operators now
      reliably set <span class="Li">$!</span> when failing due to being applied
      to a closed or otherwise invalid file handle.</li>
  <li>File test operators for Unix permission bits that don't exist on a
      particular platform, such as <span class="Li">&quot;-k&quot;</span>
      (sticky bit) on Windows, now check that the file being tested exists
      before returning the blanket false result, and yield the appropriate
      errors if the argument doesn't refer to a file.</li>
  <li>Fixed a 'read before buffer' overrun when parsing a range starting with
      <span class="Li">&quot;\N{}&quot;</span> at the beginning of the character
      set for the transliteration operator. [perl #132245]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=132245&gt;</li>
  <li>Fixed a leaked scalar when parsing an empty
      <span class="Li">&quot;\N{}&quot;</span> at compile-time. [perl #132245]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=132245&gt;</li>
  <li>Calling <span class="Li">&quot;do $path&quot;</span> on a directory or
      block device now yields a meaningful error code in
      <span class="Li">$!</span>. [perl #125774]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=125774&gt;</li>
  <li>Regexp substitution using an overloaded replacement value that provides a
      tainted stringification now correctly taints the resulting string. [perl
      #115266] &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=115266&gt;</li>
  <li>Lexical sub declarations in <span class="Li">&quot;do&quot;</span> blocks
      such as <span class="Li">&quot;do { my sub lex; 123 }&quot;</span> could
      corrupt the stack, erasing items already on the stack in the enclosing
      statement. This has been fixed. [perl #132442]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=132442&gt;</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;pack&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;unpack&quot;</span> can now handle repeat counts
      and lengths that exceed two billion. [perl #119367]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=119367&gt;</li>
  <li>Digits past the radix point in octal and binary floating point literals
      now have the correct weight on platforms where a floating point
      significand doesn't fit into an integer type.</li>
  <li>The canonical truth value no longer has a spurious special meaning as a
      callable subroutine. It used to be a magic placeholder for a missing
      <span class="Li">&quot;import&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;unimport&quot;</span> method, but is now treated
      like any other string <span class="Li">1</span>. [perl #126042]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126042&gt;</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;system&quot;</span> now reduces its arguments to
      strings in the parent process, so any effects of stringifying them (such
      as overload methods being called or warnings being emitted) are visible in
      the way the program expects. [perl #121105]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=121105&gt;</li>
  <li>The <span class="Li">&quot;readpipe()&quot;</span> built-in function now
      checks at compile time that it has only one parameter expression, and puts
      it in scalar context, thus ensuring that it doesn't corrupt the stack at
      runtime. [perl #4574]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=4574&gt;</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;sort&quot;</span> now performs correct reference
      counting when aliasing <span class="Li">$a</span> and
      <span class="Li">$b</span>, thus avoiding premature destruction and
      leakage of scalars if they are re-aliased during execution of the sort
      comparator. [perl #92264]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=92264&gt;</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;reverse&quot;</span> with no operand, reversing
      <span class="Li">$_</span> by default, is no longer in danger of
      corrupting the stack. [perl #132544]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=132544&gt;</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;exec&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;system&quot;</span>, et al are no longer liable to
      have their argument lists corrupted by reentrant calls and by magic such
      as tied scalars. [perl #129888]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=129888&gt;</li>
  <li>Perl's own <span class="Li">&quot;malloc&quot;</span> no longer gets
      confused by attempts to allocate more than a gigabyte on a 64-bit
      platform. [perl #119829]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=119829&gt;</li>
  <li>Stacked file test operators in a sort comparator expression no longer
      cause a crash. [perl #129347]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=129347&gt;</li>
  <li>An identity <span class="Li">&quot;tr///&quot;</span> transformation on a
      reference is no longer mistaken for that reference for the purposes of
      deciding whether it can be assigned to. [perl #130578]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=130578&gt;</li>
  <li>Lengthy hexadecimal, octal, or binary floating point literals no longer
      cause undefined behaviour when parsing digits that are of such low
      significance that they can't affect the floating point value. [perl
      #131894] &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=131894&gt;</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;open $$scalarref...&quot;</span> and similar
      invocations no longer leak the file handle. [perl #115814]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=115814&gt;</li>
  <li>Some convoluted kinds of regexp no longer cause an arithmetic overflow
      when compiled. [perl #131893]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=131893&gt;</li>
  <li>The default typemap, by avoiding
      <span class="Li">&quot;newGVgen&quot;</span>, now no longer leaks when
      XSUBs return file handles (<span class="Li">&quot;PerlIO *&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;FILE *&quot;</span>). [perl #115814]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=115814&gt;</li>
  <li>Creating a <span class="Li">&quot;BEGIN&quot;</span> block as an XS
      subroutine with a prototype no longer crashes because of the early freeing
      of the subroutine.</li>
  <li>The <span class="Li">&quot;printf&quot;</span> format specifier
      <span class="Li">&quot;%.0f&quot;</span> no longer rounds incorrectly
      [perl #47602] &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=47602&gt;,
      and now shows the correct sign for a negative zero.</li>
  <li>Fixed an issue where the error <span class="Li">&quot;Scalar value
      @arrayname[0] better</span> <span class="Li">written as
      $arrayname&quot;</span> would give an error <span class="Li">&quot;Cannot
      printf Inf with 'c'&quot;</span> when arrayname starts with
      <span class="Li">&quot;Inf&quot;</span>. [perl #132645]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=132645&gt;</li>
  <li>The Perl implementation of <span class="Li">&quot;getcwd()&quot;</span> in
      <span class="Li">&quot;Cwd&quot;</span> in the PathTools distribution now
      behaves the same as XS implementation on errors: it returns an error, and
      sets <span class="Li">$!</span>. [perl #132648]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=132648&gt;</li>
  <li>Vivify array elements when putting them on the stack. Fixes [perl #8910]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=8910&gt; (reported in April
      2002).</li>
  <li>Fixed parsing of braced subscript after parens. Fixes [perl #8045]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=8045&gt; (reported in
      December 2001).</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;tr/non_utf8/long_non_utf8/c&quot;</span> could give
      the wrong results when the length of the replacement character list was
      greater than 0x7fff.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;tr/non_utf8/non_utf8/cd&quot;</span> failed to add
      the implied <span class="Li">&quot;\x{100}-\x{7fffffff}&quot;</span> to
      the search character list.</li>
  <li>Compilation failures within &quot;perl-within-perl&quot; constructs, such
      as with string interpolation and the right part of
      <span class="Li">&quot;s///e&quot;</span>, now cause compilation to abort
      earlier.
    <p class="Pp">Previously compilation could continue in order to report other
        errors, but the failed sub-parse could leave partly parsed constructs on
        the parser shift-reduce stack, confusing the parser, leading to perl
        crashes. [perl #125351]
        &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=125351&gt;</p>
  </li>
  <li>On threaded perls where the decimal point (radix) character is not a dot,
      it has been possible for a race to occur between threads when one needs to
      use the real radix character (such as with
      <span class="Li">&quot;sprintf&quot;</span>). This has now been fixed by
      use of a mutex on systems without thread-safe locales, and the problem
      just doesn't come up on those with thread-safe locales.</li>
  <li>Errors while compiling a regex character class could sometime trigger an
      assertion failure. [perl #132163]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=132163&gt;</li>
