<p class="Pp">The (perl) application <b>snmpconf</b> can be used to generate

  Configuration - Real Security</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">SNMPv3 is added flexible security models to the SNMP packet
    structure so that multiple security solutions could be used. SNMPv3 was
    original defined with a &quot;User-based Security Model&quot; (USM)
    [RFC3414] that required maintaining a SNMP-specific user database. This was
    later determined to be troublesome to maintain and had some minor security
    issues. The IETF has since added additional security models to tunnel SNMP
    over SSH [RFC5592] and DTLS/TLS [RFC-to-be]. Net-SNMP contains robust
    support for SNMPv3/USM, SNMPv3/TLS, and SNMPv3/DTLS. It contains partial
    support for SNMPv3/SSH as well but has not been as extensively tested. It
    also contains code for support for an experimental Kerberos based SNMPv3
    that never got standardized.</p>
<p class="Pp">Hopeful more SNMP software and devices will eventually support
    SNMP over (D)TLS or SSH, but it is likely that devices with original support
    for SNMP will only contain support for SNMP over USM. If your network
    manager supports SNMP over (D)TLS or SNMP over SSH we suggest you use one of
    these mechanisms instead of using USM, but as always with Net-SNMP we give
    you the options to pick from so you can make the choice that is best for
    you.</p>

  generic parameters</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">These parameters are generic to all the forms of SNMPv3. The
    SNMPv3 protocol defines &quot;engineIDs&quot; that uniquely identify an
    agent. The string must be consistent through time and should not change or
    conflict with another agent's engineID. Ever. Internally, Net-SNMP by
    default creates a unique engineID that is based off of the current system
    time and a random number. This should be sufficient for most users unless
    you're embedding our agent in a device where these numbers won't vary
    between boxes on the devices initial boot.</p>

  over TLS</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">SNMPv3 may be tunneled over TLS and DTLS. TLS runs over TCP and
    DTLS is the UDP equivalent. Wes Hardaker (the founder of Net-SNMP) performed
    a study and presented it at an IETF meeting that showed that TCP based
    protocols are sufficient for stable networks but quickly becomes a problem
    in unstable networks with even moderate levels of packet loss (~ 20-30%). If
    you are going to use TLS or DTLS, you should use the one appropriate for
    your networking environment. You should potentially turn them both on so
    your management system can access either the UDP or the TCP port as
  needed.</p>
<p class="Pp">Many of the configuration tokens described below are prefixed with
    a '[snmp]' tag. If you place these tokens in your snmpd.conf file, this take

      dns name value (eg foo.net-snmp.org), an IP address (eg 192.0.2.1) or a
      common name &quot;Wes Hardaker&quot;. The --any flag specifies that any of
      the subjecAltName fields may be used. Make sure once a securityName has

      discussed later in this manual page.</dd>

<p class="Pp">The Transport Security Model [RFC5591] defines a SNMPv3 security
    system for use with &quot;tunneled&quot; security protocols like TLS, DTLS
    and SSH. It is a very simple security model that simply lets properly
    protected packets to pass through into the snmp application. The transport
    is required to pass a securityName to use to the TSM and the TSM may
    optionally prefix this with a transport string (see below).</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="tsmUseTransportPrefix"><a class="permalink" href="#tsmUseTransportPrefix">tsmUseTransportPrefix
    (1|yes|true|0|no|false)</a></dt>
  <dd>If set to true, the TSM module will take every securityName passed to it
      from the transports underneath and prefix it with a string that
      specifically identities the transport it came from. This is useful to
      avoid securityName clashes with transports that generate identical
      security names. For example, if the ssh security transport delivered the
      security name of &quot;hardaker&quot; for a SSH connection and the TLS
      security transport also delivered the security name of
      &quot;hardaker&quot; for a TLS connection then it would be impossible to
      separate out these two users to provide separate access control rights.
      With the tsmUseTransportPrefix set to true, however, the securityNames
      would be prefixed appropriately with one of: &quot;tls:&quot;,

<p class="Pp">SNMPv3 was originally defined using the User-Based Security Model
    (USM), which contains a private list of users and keys specific to the
    SNMPv3 protocol. The operational community, however, declared it a pain to
    manipulate yet another database and would prefer to use existing

<p class="Pp">To use the USM based SNMPv3-specific users, you'll need to create

      is assumed to be the same as the authentication passphrase. Note that the
      users created will be useless unless they are also added to the VACM
      access control tables described above.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>SHA authentication and DES/AES privacy require OpenSSL to be installed and

  <dt></dt>
  <dd>This directive should be placed into the /var/db/net-snmp/snmpd.conf file

      storage of the master password for that user) and replaced with the key
      that is derived from it. This key is a localized key, so that if it is

<p class="Pp">One of the first distinguishing features of the original UCD suite
    was the ability to extend the functionality of the agent - not just by
    recompiling with code for new MIB modules, but also by configuring the
    running agent to report additional information. There are a number of
    techniques to support this, including:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>running external commands (<i>exec</i>, <i>extend</i>, <i>pass</i>)</li>

  <dd>That line will set the sysDescr.0 value to &quot;my own sysDescr&quot; as

  <dd>Note that care must be taken when using this. For example, if you try to
      override a property of the 3rd interface in the ifTable with a new value
      and later the numbering within the ifTable changes it's index ordering
      you'll end up with problems and your modified value won't appear in the

<p class="Pp">If you're trying to figure out aspects of the various mib modules
    (possibly some that you've added yourself), the following may help you spit
    out some useful debugging information. First off, please read the snmpd
    manual page on the -D flag. Then the following configuration snmpd.conf
    token, combined with the -D flag, can produce useful output:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="injectHandler"><a class="permalink" href="#injectHandler">injectHandler
    HANDLER modulename [beforeThis]</a></dt>
  <dd>This will insert new handlers into the section of the mib tree referenced
      by &quot;modulename&quot;. If &quot;beforeThis&quot; is specified then the
      module will be injected before the named module. This is useful for
      getting a handler into the exact right position in the chain.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>The types of handlers available for insertion are:</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="stash_cache"><a class="permalink" href="#stash_cache">stash_cache</a></dt>
  <dd>Caches information returned from the lower level. This greatly help the
      performance of the agent, at the cost of caching the data such that its no
      longer &quot;live&quot; for 30 seconds (in this future, this will be
      configurable). Note that this means snmpd will use more memory as well
      while the information is cached. Currently this only works for handlers
      registered using the table_iterator support, which is only a few mib
      tables. To use it, you need to make sure to install it before the
      table_iterator point in the chain, so to do this:
    <p class="Pp">
      <br/>
       injectHandler stash_cache NAME table_iterator</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you want a table to play with, try walking the

  <dt id="debug"><a class="permalink" href="#debug">debug</a></dt>

      requests to getnext requests before the final module receives it.</dd>
