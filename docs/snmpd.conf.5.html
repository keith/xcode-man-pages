The Net-SNMP agent uses one or more configuration files to control its operation
  and the management information provided. These files (<b>snmpd.conf</b> and
  <b>snmpd.local.conf</b>) can be located in one of several locations, as
  described in the <i>snmp_config(5)</i> manual page.
<p class="Pp">The (perl) application <b>snmpconf</b> can be used to generate
    configuration files for the most common agent requirements. See the
    <i>snmpconf(1)</i> manual page for more information, or try running the
    command:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>snmpconf -g basic_setup</dt>
  <dd></dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p class="Pp">There are a large number of directives that can be specified, but
    these mostly fall into four distinct categories:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>those controlling who can access the agent</li>
  <li>those configuring the information that is supplied by the agent</li>
  <li>those controlling active monitoring of the local system</li>
  <li>those concerned with extending the functionality of the agent.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">Some directives don't fall naturally into any of these four
    categories, but this covers the majority of the contents of a typical

Although most configuration directives are concerned with the MIB information

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>agentaddress
    [&lt;transport-specifier&gt;:]&lt;transport-address&gt;[,...]</dt>
  <dd>defines a list of listening addresses, on which to receive incoming SNMP

  <dt>maxGetbulkRepeats NUM</dt>
  <dd>Sets the maximum number of responses allowed for a single variable in a
      getbulk request. Set to 0 to enable the default and set it to -1 to enable
      unlimited. Because memory is allocated ahead of time, sitting this to

      trusted. A repeat number greater than this will be truncated to this
      value.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>This is set by default to -1.</dd>
  <dt>maxGetbulkResponses NUM</dt>
  <dd>Sets the maximum number of responses allowed for a getbulk request. This

  <dt></dt>
  <dd>In general, the total number of responses will not be allowed to exceed

<h2 class="Ss" id="SNMPv3_Configuration_-_Real_Security"><a class="permalink" href="#SNMPv3_Configuration_-_Real_Security">SNMPv3
  Configuration - Real Security</a></h2>
SNMPv3 is added flexible security models to the SNMP packet structure so that
  multiple security solutions could be used. SNMPv3 was original defined with a
  &quot;User-based Security Model&quot; (USM) [RFC3414] that required
  maintaining a SNMP-specific user database. This was later determined to be
  troublesome to maintain and had some minor security issues. The IETF has since
  added additional security models to tunnel SNMP over SSH [RFC5592] and
  DTLS/TLS [RFC-to-be]. Net-SNMP contains robust support for SNMPv3/USM,
  SNMPv3/TLS, and SNMPv3/DTLS. It contains partial support for SNMPv3/SSH as
  well but has not been as extensively tested. It also contains code for support
  for an experimental Kerberos based SNMPv3 that never got standardized.
<p class="Pp">Hopeful more SNMP software and devices will eventually support
    SNMP over (D)TLS or SSH, but it is likely that devices with original support
    for SNMP will only contain support for SNMP over USM. If your network
    manager supports SNMP over (D)TLS or SNMP over SSH we suggest you use one of
    these mechanisms instead of using USM, but as always with Net-SNMP we give
    you the options to pick from so you can make the choice that is best for
    you.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="SNMPv3_generic_parameters"><a class="permalink" href="#SNMPv3_generic_parameters">SNMPv3
  generic parameters</a></h2>
These parameters are generic to all the forms of SNMPv3. The SNMPv3 protocol
  defines &quot;engineIDs&quot; that uniquely identify an agent. The string must
  be consistent through time and should not change or conflict with another
  agent's engineID. Ever. Internally, Net-SNMP by default creates a unique
  engineID that is based off of the current system time and a random number.
  This should be sufficient for most users unless you're embedding our agent in
  a device where these numbers won't vary between boxes on the devices initial
  boot.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>EngineIDs are used both as a &quot;context&quot; for selecting information

<h2 class="Ss" id="SNMPv3_over_TLS"><a class="permalink" href="#SNMPv3_over_TLS">SNMPv3
  over TLS</a></h2>
SNMPv3 may be tunneled over TLS and DTLS. TLS runs over TCP and DTLS is the UDP
  equivalent. Wes Hardaker (the founder of Net-SNMP) performed a study and
  presented it at an IETF meeting that showed that TCP based protocols are
  sufficient for stable networks but quickly becomes a problem in unstable
  networks with even moderate levels of packet loss (~ 20-30%). If you are going
  to use TLS or DTLS, you should use the one appropriate for your networking
  environment. You should potentially turn them both on so your management
  system can access either the UDP or the TCP port as needed.
<p class="Pp">Many of the configuration tokens described below are prefixed with
    a '[snmp]' tag. If you place these tokens in your snmpd.conf file, this take

To use SSH, you'll need to configure sshd to invoke the sshtosnmp program as

  with the Transport Security Model (TSM)</a></h2>
The Transport Security Model [RFC5591] defines a SNMPv3 security system for use
  with &quot;tunneled&quot; security protocols like TLS, DTLS and SSH. It is a
  very simple security model that simply lets properly protected packets to pass
  through into the snmp application. The transport is required to pass a
  securityName to use to the TSM and the TSM may optionally prefix this with a
  transport string (see below).
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>tsmUseTransportPrefix (1|yes|true|0|no|false)</dt>
  <dd>If set to true, the TSM module will take every securityName passed to it
      from the transports underneath and prefix it with a string that
      specifically identities the transport it came from. This is useful to
      avoid securityName clashes with transports that generate identical
      security names. For example, if the ssh security transport delivered the
      security name of &quot;hardaker&quot; for a SSH connection and the TLS
      security transport also delivered the security name of
      &quot;hardaker&quot; for a TLS connection then it would be impossible to
      separate out these two users to provide separate access control rights.
      With the tsmUseTransportPrefix set to true, however, the securityNames
      would be prefixed appropriately with one of: &quot;tls:&quot;,
      &quot;dtls:&quot; or &quot;ssh:&quot;.</dd>

SNMPv3 was originally defined using the User-Based Security Model (USM), which
  contains a private list of users and keys specific to the SNMPv3 protocol. The
  operational community, however, declared it a pain to manipulate yet another
  database and would prefer to use existing infrastructure. To that end the IETF
  created the ISMS working group to battle that problem, and the ISMS working
  group decided to tunnel SNMP over SSH and DTLS to make use existing user and
  authentication infrastructures.

<h2 class="Ss" id="SNMPv3_USM_Users"><a class="permalink" href="#SNMPv3_USM_Users">SNMPv3
  USM Users</a></h2>
To use the USM based SNMPv3-specific users, you'll need to create them. It is
  recommended you <b>use the net-snmp-config command</b> to do this, but you can
  also do it by directly specifying createUser directives yourself instead:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>createUser [-e ENGINEID] username (MD5|SHA) authpassphrase [DES|AES]
    [privpassphrase]</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>MD5 and SHA are the authentication types to use. DES and AES are the
      privacy protocols to use. If the privacy passphrase is not specified, it
      is assumed to be the same as the authentication passphrase. Note that the
      users created will be useless unless they are also added to the VACM
      access control tables described above.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>SHA authentication and DES/AES privacy require OpenSSL to be installed and
      the agent to be built with OpenSSL support. MD5 authentication may be used
      without OpenSSL.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Warning: the minimum pass phrase length is 8 characters.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>SNMPv3 users can be created at runtime using the <i>snmpusm(1)</i>

  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Instead of figuring out how to use this directive and where to put it (see
      below), just run &quot;net-snmp-config --create-snmpv3-user&quot; instead,
      which will add one of these lines to the right place.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>This directive should be placed into the /var/db/net-snmp/snmpd.conf file
      instead of the other normal locations. The reason is that the information
      is read from the file and then the line is removed (eliminating the
      storage of the master password for that user) and replaced with the key
      that is derived from it. This key is a localized key, so that if it is
      stolen it can not be used to access other agents. If the password is

  CONTROL</a></h1>
<b>snmpd</b> supports the View-Based Access Control Model (VACM) as defined in
  RFC 2575, to control who can retrieve or update information. To this end, it
  recognizes various directives relating to access control.
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Traditional_Access_Control"><a class="permalink" href="#Traditional_Access_Control">Traditional
  Access Control</a></h2>
Most simple access control requirements can be specified using the directives
  <i>rouser</i>/<i>rwuser</i> (for SNMPv3) or
  <i>rocommunity</i>/<i>rwcommunity</i> (for SNMPv1 or SNMPv2c).
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>rouser [-s SECMODEL] USER [noauth|auth|priv [OID | -V VIEW
    [CONTEXT]]]</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>rwuser [-s SECMODEL] USER [noauth|auth|priv [OID | -V VIEW
    [CONTEXT]]]</dt>
  <dd>specify an SNMPv3 user that will be allowed read-only (GET and GETNEXT) or
      read-write (GET, GETNEXT and SET) access respectively. By default, this
      will provide access to the full OID tree for authenticated (including
      encrypted) SNMPv3 requests, using the default context. An alternative
      minimum security level can be specified using <i>noauth</i> (to allow
      unauthenticated requests), or <i>priv</i> (to enforce use of encryption).
      The OID field restricts access for that user to the subtree rooted at the
      given OID, or the named view. An optional context can also be specified,
      or &quot;context*&quot; to denote a context prefix. If no context field is
      specified (or the token &quot;*&quot; is used), the directive will match
      all possible contexts.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>If SECMODEL is specified then it will be the security model required for
      that user (note that identical user names may come in over different
      security models and will be appropriately separated via the access control
      settings). The default security model is &quot;usm&quot; and the other
      common security models are likely &quot;tsm&quot; when using (D)TLS or SSH
      support and &quot;ksm&quot; if the Kerberos support has been compiled
    in.</dd>
  <dt>rocommunity COMMUNITY [SOURCE [OID | -V VIEW [CONTEXT]]]</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>rwcommunity COMMUNITY [SOURCE [OID | -V VIEW [CONTEXT]]]</dt>
  <dd>specify an SNMPv1 or SNMPv2c community that will be allowed read-only (GET
      and GETNEXT) or read-write (GET, GETNEXT and SET) access respectively. By
      default, this will provide access to the full OID tree for such requests,
      regardless of where they were sent from. The SOURCE token can be used to
      restrict access to requests from the specified system(s) - see
      <i>com2sec</i> for the full details. The OID field restricts access for
      that community to the subtree rooted at the given OID, or named view.
      Contexts are typically less relevant to community-based SNMP versions, but
      the same behaviour applies here.</dd>
  <dt>rocommunity6 COMMUNITY [SOURCE [OID | -V VIEW [CONTEXT]]]</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>rwcommunity6 COMMUNITY [SOURCE [OID | -V VIEW [CONTEXT]]]</dt>
  <dd>are directives relating to requests received using IPv6 (if the agent
      supports such transport domains). The interpretation of the SOURCE, OID,
      VIEW and CONTEXT tokens are exactly the same as for the IPv4
    versions.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">In each case, only one directive should be specified for a given
    SNMPv3 user, or community string. It is <b>not</b> appropriate to specify
    both <i>rouser</i> and <i>rwuser</i> directives referring to the same SNMPv3
    user (or equivalent community settings). The <i>rwuser</i> directive
    provides all the access of <i>rouser</i> (as well as allowing SET support).
    The same holds true for the community-based directives.</p>
<p class="Pp">More complex access requirements (such as access to two or more
    distinct OID subtrees, or different views for GET and SET requests) should
    use one of the other access control mechanisms. Note that if several
    distinct communities or SNMPv3 users need to be granted the same level of
    access, it would also be more efficient to use the main VACM configuration
    directives.</p>

The final group of directives extend the VACM approach into a more flexible
  mechanism, which can be applied to other access control requirements. Rather
  than the fixed three views of the standard VACM mechanism, this can be used to
  configure various different view types. As far as the main SNMP agent is
  concerned, the two main view types are <i>read</i> and <i>write</i>,
  corresponding to the READ and WRITE views of the main <i>access</i> directive.
  See the 'snmptrapd.conf(5)' man page for discussion of other view types.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>authcommunity TYPES COMMUNITY [SOURCE [OID | -V VIEW [CONTEXT]]]</dt>
  <dd>is an alternative to the <i>rocommunity</i>/<i>rwcommunity</i> directives.
      TYPES will usually be <i>read</i> or <i>read,write</i> respectively. The
      view specification can either be an OID subtree (as before), or a named
      view (defined using the <i>view</i> directive) for greater flexibility. If
      this is omitted, then access will be allowed to the full OID tree. If
      CONTEXT is specified, access is configured within this SNMPv3 context.
      Otherwise the default context (&quot;&quot;) is used.</dd>
  <dt>authuser TYPES [-s MODEL] USER [LEVEL [OID | -V VIEW [CONTEXT]]]</dt>
  <dd>is an alternative to the <i>rouser</i>/<i>rwuser</i> directives. The

  <dt>authgroup TYPES [-s MODEL] GROUP [LEVEL [OID | -V VIEW [CONTEXT]]]</dt>
  <dd>is a companion to the <i>authuser</i> directive, specifying access for a
      particular group (defined using the <i>group</i> directive as usual). Both
      <i>authuser</i> and <i>authgroup</i> default to authenticated requests -
      LEVEL can also be specified as <i>noauth</i> or <i>priv</i> to allow
      unauthenticated requests, or require encryption respectively. Both
      <i>authuser</i> and <i>authgroup</i> directives also default to
      configuring access for SNMPv3/USM requests - use the '-s' flag to specify
      an alternative security model (using the same values as for <i>access</i>
      above).</dd>
  <dt>authaccess TYPES [-s MODEL] GROUP VIEW [LEVEL [CONTEXT]]</dt>
  <dd>also configures the access for a particular group, specifying the name and
      type of view to apply. The MODEL and LEVEL fields are interpreted in the
      same way as for <i>authgroup</i>. If CONTEXT is specified, access is
      configured within this SNMPv3 context (or contexts with this prefix if the

Most of the information reported by the Net-SNMP agent is retrieved from the

      specifying one of these directives makes the corresponding object
      read-only, and attempts to SET it will result in a <i>notWritable</i>

  <dt>sysServices NUMBER</dt>
  <dd>sets the value of the sysServices.0 object. For a host system, a good

One of the first distinguishing features of the original UCD suite was the

  report additional information. There are a number of techniques to support
  this, including:
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>running external commands (<i>exec</i>, <i>extend</i>, <i>pass</i>)</li>

The first group of extension directives invoke arbitrary commands, and rely on
  the MIB structure (and management applications) having the flexibility to
  accommodate and interpret the output. This is a convenient way to make
  information available quickly and simply, but is of no use when implementing
  specific MIB objects, where the extension must conform to the structure of the
  MIB (rather than vice versa). The remaining extension mechanisms are all
  concerned with such MIB-specific situations - starting with
  &quot;pass-through&quot; scripts. Use of this mechanism requires that the
  agent was built with support for the <i>ucd-snmp/pass</i> and

  Perl Support</a></h2>
Programs using the previous extension mechanisms can be written in any
  convenient programming language - including perl, which is a common choice for
  pass-through extensions in particular. However the Net-SNMP agent also
  includes support for embedded perl technology (similar to <i>mod_perl</i> for
  the Apache web server). This allows the agent to interpret perl scripts
  directly, thus avoiding the overhead of spawning processes and initializing
  the perl system when a request is received.
<p class="Pp">Use of this mechanism requires that the agent was built with
    support for the embedded perl mechanism, which is not part of the default
    build environment. It must be explicitly included by specifying the
    '--enable-embedded-perl' option to the configure script when the package is
    first built.</p>
<p class="Pp">If enabled, the following directives will be recognised:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>disablePerl true</dt>
  <dd>will turn off embedded perl support entirely (e.g. if there are problems
      with the perl installation).</dd>
  <dt>perlInitFile FILE</dt>
  <dd>loads the specified initialisation file (if present) immediately before
      the first <i>perl</i> directive is parsed. If not explicitly specified,
      the agent will look for the default initialisation file
      /usr/share/snmp/snmp_perl.pl.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>The default initialisation file creates an instance of a NetSNMP::agent
      object - a variable $agent which can be used to register perl-based MIB
      handler routines.</dd>
  <dt>perl EXPRESSION</dt>

Most of the MIBs supported by the Net-SNMP agent are implemented as C code
  modules, which were compiled and linked into the agent libraries when the
  suite was first built. Such implementation modules can also be compiled
  independently and loaded into the running agent once it has started. Use of
  this mechanism requires that the agent was built with support for the
  <i>ucd-snmp/dlmod</i> module (which is included as part of the default build
  configuration).
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>dlmod NAME PATH</dt>
  <dd>will load the shared object module from the file PATH (an absolute

  <dt>Note:</dt>

Another mechanism for extending the functionality of the agent is to pass
  selected requests (or selected varbinds) to another SNMP agent, which can be
  running on the same host (presumably listening on a different port), or on a
  remote system. This can be viewed either as the main agent delegating requests
  to the remote one, or acting as a proxy for it. Use of this mechanism requires
  that the agent was built with support for the <i>ucd-snmp/proxy</i> module
  (which is included as part of the default build configuration).
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>proxy [-Cn CONTEXTNAME] [SNMPCMD_ARGS] HOST OID [REMOTEOID]</dt>

  <dd>The proxied request will <i>not</i> use the administrative settings from
      the original request.</dd>

<p class="Pp">If a CONTEXTNAME is specified, this will register the proxy
    delegation within the named context in the local agent. Defining multiple
    <i>proxy</i> directives for the same OID but different contexts can be used
    to query several remote agents through a single proxy, by specifying the
    appropriate SNMPv3 context in the incoming request (or using suitable
    configured community strings - see the <i>com2sec</i> directive).</p>
<p class="Pp">Specifying the REMOID parameter will map the local MIB tree rooted
    at OID to an equivalent subtree rooted at REMOID on the remote agent.</p>

The Net-SNMP agent supports the SMUX protocol (RFC 1227) to communicate with
