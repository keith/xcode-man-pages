<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Git supports transferring data in packfiles over the ssh://,
    git://, http:// and file:// transports. There exist two sets of protocols,
    one for pushing data from a client to a server and another for fetching data
    from a server to a client. The three transports (ssh, git, file) use the
    same protocol to transfer data. http is documented in
    <b>gitprotocol-http</b>(5).</p>
<p class="Pp">The processes invoked in the canonical Git implementation are
    <i>upload-pack</i> on the server side and <i>fetch-pack</i> on the client
    side for fetching data; then <i>receive-pack</i> on the server and
    <i>send-pack</i> on the client for pushing data. The protocol functions to
    have a server tell a client what is currently on the server, then for the
    two to negotiate the smallest amount of data to send in order to fully
    update one or the other.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="PKT"><a class="permalink" href="#PKT">PKT-LINE
  FORMAT</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The descriptions below build on the pkt-line format described in
    <b>gitprotocol-common</b>(5). When the grammar indicate
    <b>PKT-LINE(...)</b>, unless otherwise noted the usual pkt-line LF rules
    apply: the sender SHOULD include a LF, but the receiver MUST NOT complain if
    it is not present.</p>
<p class="Pp">An error packet is a special pkt-line that contains an error
    string.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<br/>
  error-line     =  PKT-LINE(&quot;ERR&quot; SP explanation-text)</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">Throughout the protocol, where <b>PKT-LINE(...)</b> is expected,
    an error packet MAY be sent. Once this packet is sent by a client or a
    server, the data transfer process defined in this protocol is
  terminated.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="TRANSPORTS"><a class="permalink" href="#TRANSPORTS">TRANSPORTS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">There are three transports over which the packfile protocol is
    initiated. The Git transport is a simple, unauthenticated server that takes
    the command (almost always <i>upload-pack</i>, though Git servers can be
    configured to be globally writable, in which <i>receive- pack</i> initiation
    is also allowed) with which the client wishes to communicate and executes it
    and connects it to the requesting process.</p>
<p class="Pp">In the SSH transport, the client just runs the <i>upload-pack</i>
    or <i>receive-pack</i> process on the server over the SSH protocol and then
    communicates with that invoked process over the SSH connection.</p>
<p class="Pp">The file:// transport runs the <i>upload-pack</i> or
    <i>receive-pack</i> process locally and communicates with it over a
  pipe.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="EXTRA_PARAMETERS"><a class="permalink" href="#EXTRA_PARAMETERS">EXTRA
  PARAMETERS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The protocol provides a mechanism in which clients can send
    additional information in its first message to the server. These are called
    &quot;Extra Parameters&quot;, and are supported by the Git, SSH, and HTTP
    protocols.</p>
<p class="Pp">Each Extra Parameter takes the form of
    <b>&lt;key&gt;=&lt;value&gt;</b> or <b>&lt;key&gt;</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Servers that receive any such Extra Parameters MUST ignore all
    unrecognized keys. Currently, the only Extra Parameter recognized is
    &quot;version&quot; with a value of <i>1</i> or <i>2</i>. See
    <b>gitprotocol-v2</b>(5) for more information on protocol version 2.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="GIT_TRANSPORT"><a class="permalink" href="#GIT_TRANSPORT">GIT
  TRANSPORT</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The Git transport starts off by sending the command and repository
    on the wire using the pkt-line format, followed by a NUL byte and a hostname
    parameter, terminated by a NUL byte.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>0033git-upload-pack /project.git\0host=myserver.com\0</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The transport may send Extra Parameters by adding an additional
    NUL byte, and then adding one or more NUL-terminated strings:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>003egit-upload-pack /project.git\0host=myserver.com\0\0version=1\0</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>git-proto-request = request-command SP pathname NUL
<br/>
                    [ host-parameter NUL ] [ NUL extra-parameters ]
request-command   = &quot;git-upload-pack&quot; / &quot;git-receive-pack&quot; /

</div>
<p class="Pp">host-parameter is used for the git-daemon name based virtual
    hosting. See --interpolated-path option to git daemon, with the %H/%CH
    format characters.</p>
<p class="Pp">Basically what the Git client is doing to connect to an
    <i>upload-pack</i> process on the server side over the Git protocol is
  this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ echo -e -n \
<br/>
  &quot;003agit-upload-pack /schacon/gitbook.git\0host=example.com\0&quot; |

</div>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="SSH_TRANSPORT"><a class="permalink" href="#SSH_TRANSPORT">SSH
  TRANSPORT</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Initiating the upload-pack or receive-pack processes over SSH is
    executing the binary on the server via SSH remote execution. It is basically
    equivalent to running this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ ssh git.example.com &quot;git-upload-pack '/project.git'&quot;</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">For a server to support Git pushing and pulling for a given user
    over SSH, that user needs to be able to execute one or both of those
    commands via the SSH shell that they are provided on login. On some systems,
    that shell access is limited to only being able to run those two commands,
    or even just one of them.</p>
<p class="Pp">In an ssh:// format URI, it&#x2019;s absolute in the URI, so the
    <i>/</i> after the host name (or port number) is sent as an argument, which
    is then read by the remote git-upload-pack exactly as is, so it&#x2019;s
    effectively an absolute path in the remote filesystem.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<br/>
   git clone ssh://user@example.com/project.git
<br/>
                |
<br/>
                v
ssh user@example.com &quot;git-upload-pack '/project.git'&quot;</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">In a &quot;user@host:path&quot; format URI, its relative to the
    user&#x2019;s home directory, because the Git client will run:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<br/>
   git clone user@example.com:project.git
<br/>
                  |
<br/>
                  v
ssh user@example.com &quot;git-upload-pack 'project.git'&quot;</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The exception is if a <i>~</i> is used, in which case we execute
    it without the leading <i>/</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<br/>
   ssh://user@example.com/~alice/project.git,
<br/>
                  |
<br/>
                  v
ssh user@example.com &quot;git-upload-pack '~alice/project.git'&quot;</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Depending on the value of the <b>protocol.version</b>
    configuration variable, Git may attempt to send Extra Parameters as a
    colon-separated string in the GIT_PROTOCOL environment variable. This is
    done only if the <b>ssh.variant</b> configuration variable indicates that
    the ssh command supports passing environment variables as an argument.</p>
<p class="Pp">A few things to remember here:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;The &quot;command name&quot; is spelled with dash
  (e.g. git-upload-pack), but this can be overridden by the client;</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;The repository path is always quoted with single
  quotes.</div>

<h1 class="Sh" id="FETCHING_DATA_FROM_A_SERVER"><a class="permalink" href="#FETCHING_DATA_FROM_A_SERVER">FETCHING
  DATA FROM A SERVER</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">When one Git repository wants to get data that a second repository
    has, the first can <i>fetch</i> from the second. This operation determines
    what data the server has that the client does not then streams that data
    down to the client in packfile format.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh">REFERENCE DISCOVERY</h1>
<p class="Pp">When the client initially connects the server will immediately
    respond with a version number (if &quot;version=1&quot; is sent as an Extra
    Parameter), and a listing of each reference it has (all branches and tags)
    along with the object name that each reference currently points to.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="PACKFILE_NEGOTIATION"><a class="permalink" href="#PACKFILE_NEGOTIATION">PACKFILE
  NEGOTIATION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">After reference and capabilities discovery, the client can decide
    to terminate the connection by sending a flush-pkt, telling the server it
    can now gracefully terminate, and disconnect, when it does not need any pack
    data. This can happen with the ls-remote command, and also can happen when
    the client already is up to date.</p>
<p class="Pp">Otherwise, it enters the negotiation phase, where the client and
    server determine what the minimal packfile necessary for transport is, by
    telling the server what objects it wants, its shallow objects (if any), and
    the maximum commit depth it wants (if any). The client will also send a list
    of the capabilities it wants to be in effect, out of what the server said it
    could do with the first <i>want</i> line.</p>

<div class="Bd-indent">

  filter-request    =  PKT-LINE(&quot;filter&quot; SP filter-spec)</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">Clients MUST send all the obj-ids it wants from the reference
    discovery phase as <i>want</i> lines. Clients MUST send at least one
    <i>want</i> command in the request body. Clients MUST NOT mention an obj-id
    in a <i>want</i> command which did not appear in the response obtained
    through ref discovery.</p>
<p class="Pp">The client MUST write all obj-ids which it only has shallow copies
    of (meaning that it does not have the parents of a commit) as <i>shallow</i>
    lines so that the server is aware of the limitations of the client&#x2019;s
    history.</p>
<p class="Pp">The client now sends the maximum commit history depth it wants for
    this transaction, which is the number of commits it wants from the tip of
    the history, if any, as a <i>deepen</i> line. A depth of 0 is the same as
    not making a depth request. The client does not want to receive any commits
    beyond this depth, nor does it want objects needed only to complete those
    commits. Commits whose parents are not received as a result are defined as
    shallow and marked as such in the server. This information is sent back to
    the client in the next step.</p>
<p class="Pp">The client can optionally request that pack-objects omit various
    objects from the packfile using one of several filtering techniques. These
    are intended for use with partial clone and partial fetch operations. An
    object that does not meet a filter-spec value is omitted unless explicitly
    requested in a <i>want</i> line. See <b>rev-list</b> for possible
    filter-spec values.</p>
<p class="Pp">Once all the <i>want&#x2019;s and 'shallow&#x2019;s (and optional
    'deepen</i>) are transferred, clients MUST send a flush-pkt, to tell the
    server side that it is done sending the list.</p>
<p class="Pp">Otherwise, if the client sent a positive depth request, the server
    will determine which commits will and will not be shallow and send this
    information to the client. If the client did not request a positive depth,
    this step is skipped.</p>

<div class="Bd-indent">

<br/>
  shallow-line     =  PKT-LINE(&quot;shallow&quot; SP obj-id)
<br/>
  unshallow-line   =  PKT-LINE(&quot;unshallow&quot; SP obj-id)</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">If the client has requested a positive depth, the server will
    compute the set of commits which are no deeper than the desired depth. The
    set of commits start at the client&#x2019;s wants.</p>
<p class="Pp">The server writes <i>shallow</i> lines for each commit whose
    parents will not be sent as a result. The server writes an <i>unshallow</i>
    line for each commit which the client has indicated is shallow, but is no
    longer shallow at the currently requested depth (that is, its parents will
    now be sent). The server MUST NOT mark as unshallow anything which the
    client has not indicated was shallow.</p>
<p class="Pp">Now the client will send a list of the obj-ids it has using
    <i>have</i> lines, so the server can make a packfile that only contains the
    objects that the client needs. In multi_ack mode, the canonical
    implementation will send up to 32 of these at a time, then will send a
    flush-pkt. The canonical implementation will skip ahead and send the next 32
    immediately, so that there is always a block of 32 &quot;in-flight on the
    wire&quot; at a time.</p>

<p class="Pp">If the server reads <i>have</i> lines, it then will respond by

<p class="Pp">In multi_ack mode:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;the server will respond with <i>ACK obj-id

<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;once the server has found an acceptable common

<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;the server will then send a <i>NAK</i> and then
  wait for another response from the client - either a <i>done</i> or another
  list of <i>have</i> lines.</div>
<p class="Pp">In multi_ack_detailed mode:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;the server will differentiate the ACKs where it
  is signaling that it is ready to send data with <i>ACK obj-id ready</i> lines,
  and signals the identified common commits with <i>ACK obj-id common</i>
  lines.</div>
<p class="Pp">Without either multi_ack or multi_ack_detailed:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;upload-pack sends &quot;ACK obj-id&quot; on the
  first common object it finds. After that it says nothing until the client
  gives it a &quot;done&quot;.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;upload-pack sends &quot;NAK&quot; on a flush-pkt
  if no common object has been found yet. If one has been found, and thus an ACK
  was already sent, it&#x2019;s silent on the flush-pkt.</div>
<p class="Pp">After the client has gotten enough ACK responses that it can
    determine that the server has enough information to send an efficient
    packfile (in the canonical implementation, this is determined when it has
    received enough ACKs that it can color everything left in the --date-order
    queue as common with the server, or the --date-order queue is empty), or the
    client determines that it wants to give up (in the canonical implementation,
    this is determined when the client sends 256 <i>have</i> lines without
    getting any of them ACKed by the server - meaning there is nothing in common
    and the server should just send all of its objects), then the client will
    send a <i>done</i> command. The <i>done</i> command signals to the server
    that the client is ready to receive its packfile data.</p>
<p class="Pp">However, the 256 limit <b>only</b> turns on in the canonical
    client implementation if we have received at least one &quot;ACK %s
    continue&quot; during a prior round. This helps to ensure that at least one

  DATA</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Now that the client and server have finished negotiation about
    what the minimal amount of data that needs to be sent to the client is, the
    server will construct and send the required data in packfile format.</p>
<p class="Pp">See <b>gitformat-pack</b>(5) for what the packfile itself actually
    looks like.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <i>side-band</i> or <i>side-band-64k</i> capabilities have been
    specified by the client, the server will send the packfile data
  multiplexed.</p>
<p class="Pp">Each packet starting with the packet-line length of the amount of
    data that follows, followed by a single byte specifying the sideband the
    following data is coming in on.</p>
<p class="Pp">In <i>side-band</i> mode, it will send up to 999 data bytes plus 1
    control code, for a total of up to 1000 bytes in a pkt-line. In
    <i>side-band-64k</i> mode it will send up to 65519 data bytes plus 1 control
    code, for a total of up to 65520 bytes in a pkt-line.</p>
<p class="Pp">The sideband byte will be a <i>1</i>, <i>2</i> or a <i>3</i>.
    Sideband <i>1</i> will contain packfile data, sideband <i>2</i> will be used
    for progress information that the client will generally print to stderr and
    sideband <i>3</i> is used for error information.</p>
<p class="Pp">If no <i>side-band</i> capability was specified, the server will
    stream the entire packfile without multiplexing.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="PUSHING_DATA_TO_A_SERVER"><a class="permalink" href="#PUSHING_DATA_TO_A_SERVER">PUSHING
  DATA TO A SERVER</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Pushing data to a server will invoke the <i>receive-pack</i>
    process on the server, which will allow the client to tell it which
    references it should update and then send all the data the server will need
    for those new references to be complete. Once all the data is received and
    validated, the server will then update its references to what the client
    specified.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="AUTHENTICATION"><a class="permalink" href="#AUTHENTICATION">AUTHENTICATION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The protocol itself contains no authentication mechanisms. That is
    to be handled by the transport, such as SSH, before the <i>receive-pack</i>
    process is invoked. If <i>receive-pack</i> is configured over the Git
    transport, those repositories will be writable by anyone who can access that
    port (9418) as that transport is unauthenticated.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh">REFERENCE DISCOVERY</h1>
<p class="Pp">The reference discovery phase is done nearly the same way as it is
    in the fetching protocol. Each reference obj-id and name on the server is
    sent in packet-line format to the client, followed by a flush-pkt. The only
    real difference is that the capability listing is different - the only
    possible values are <i>report-status</i>, <i>report-status-v2</i>,
    <i>delete-refs</i>, <i>ofs-delta</i>, <i>atomic</i> and
  <i>push-options</i>.</p>

  UPDATE REQUEST AND PACKFILE TRANSFER</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Once the client knows what references the server is at, it can
    send a list of reference update requests. For each reference on the server
    that it wants to update, it sends a line listing the obj-id currently on the
    server, the obj-id the client would like to update it to and the name of the

<p class="Pp">If the server has advertised the <i>push-options</i> capability

<p class="Pp">For backwards compatibility with older Git servers, if the client
    sends a push cert and push options, it MUST send its push options both
    embedded within the push cert and after the push cert. (Note that the push
    options within the cert are prefixed, but the push options after the cert
    are not.) Both these lists MUST be the same, modulo the prefix.</p>
<p class="Pp">After that the packfile that should contain all the objects that

<p class="Pp">If the receiving end does not support delete-refs, the sending end
    MUST NOT ask for delete command.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the receiving end does not support push-cert, the sending end
    MUST NOT send a push-cert command. When a push-cert command is sent,
    command-list MUST NOT be sent; the commands recorded in the push certificate
    is used instead.</p>
<p class="Pp">The packfile MUST NOT be sent if the only command used is
    <i>delete</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">A packfile MUST be sent if either create or update command is
    used, even if the server already has all the necessary objects. In this case
    the client MUST send an empty packfile. The only time this is likely to
    happen is if the client is creating a new branch or a tag that points to an
    existing obj-id.</p>
<p class="Pp">The server will receive the packfile, unpack it, then validate
    each reference that is being updated that it hasn&#x2019;t changed while the
    request was being processed (the obj-id is still the same as the old-id),
    and it will run any update hooks to make sure that the update is acceptable.
    If all of that is fine, the server will then update the references.</p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="PUSH_CERTIFICATE"><a class="permalink" href="#PUSH_CERTIFICATE">PUSH
  CERTIFICATE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">A push certificate begins with a set of header lines. After the
    header and an empty line, the protocol commands follow, one per line. Note
    that the trailing LF in push-cert PKT-LINEs is <i>not</i> optional; it must
    be present.</p>
<p class="Pp">Currently, the following header fields are defined:</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>pusher</b> ident</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Identify the GPG key in &quot;Human Readable Name

<div class="Bd-indent">The <i>nonce</i> string the receiving repository asked
  the pushing user to include in the certificate, to prevent replay

<p class="Pp">The GPG signature lines are a detached signature for the contents
    recorded in the push certificate before the signature block begins. The
    detached signature is used to certify that the commands were given by the

<p class="Pp">After receiving the pack data from the sender, the receiver sends
    a report if <i>report-status</i> or <i>report-status-v2</i> capability is in
    effect. It is a short listing of what happened in that update. It will first
    list the status of the packfile unpacking as either <i>unpack ok</i> or
    <i>unpack [error]</i>. Then it will list the status for each of the
    references that it tried to update. Each line is either <i>ok [refname]</i>
    if the update was successful, or <i>ng [refname] [error]</i> if the update
    was not.</p>

<p class="Pp">Updates can be unsuccessful for a number of reasons. The reference
    can have changed since the reference discovery phase was originally sent,
    meaning someone pushed in the meantime. The reference being pushed could be
    a non-fast-forward reference and the update hooks or configuration could be
    set to not allow that, etc. Also, some references can be updated while
    others can be rejected.</p>
