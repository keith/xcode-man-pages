<h2 class="Ss" id="New__package_NAME_VERSION__syntax"><a class="permalink" href="#New__package_NAME_VERSION__syntax">New
  &quot;package NAME VERSION&quot; syntax</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">This new syntax allows a module author to set the
    <span class="Li">$VERSION</span> of a namespace when the namespace is
    declared with 'package'. It eliminates the need for
    <span class="Li">&quot;our $VERSION = ...&quot;</span> and similar
    constructs. E.g.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>      package Foo::Bar 1.23;
      # $Foo::Bar::VERSION == 1.23
</pre>
<p class="Pp">There are several advantages to this:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li><span class="Li">$VERSION</span> is parsed in exactly the same way as
      <span class="Li">&quot;use NAME VERSION&quot;</span></li>
  <li><span class="Li">$VERSION</span> is set at compile time</li>
  <li><span class="Li">$VERSION</span> is a version object that provides proper
      overloading of comparison operators so comparing
      <span class="Li">$VERSION</span> to decimal (1.23) or dotted-decimal
      (v1.2.3) version numbers works correctly.</li>
  <li>Eliminates <span class="Li">&quot;$VERSION = ...&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;eval $VERSION&quot;</span> clutter</li>
  <li>As it requires VERSION to be a numeric literal or v-string literal, it can
      be statically parsed by toolchain modules without
      <span class="Li">&quot;eval&quot;</span> the way MM-&gt;parse_version does
      for <span class="Li">&quot;$VERSION = ...&quot;</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">It does not break old code with only
    <span class="Li">&quot;package NAME&quot;</span>, but code that uses
    <span class="Li">&quot;package NAME VERSION&quot;</span> will need to be
    restricted to perl 5.12.0 or newer This is analogous to the change to
    <span class="Li">&quot;open&quot;</span> from two-args to three-args. Users
    requiring the latest Perl will benefit, and perhaps after several years, it
    will become a standard practice.</p>
<p class="Pp">However, <span class="Li">&quot;package NAME VERSION&quot;</span>
    requires a new, 'strict' version number format. See &quot;Version number
    formats&quot; for details.</p>

<p class="Pp">A new operator, <span class="Li">&quot;...&quot;</span>, nicknamed
    the Yada Yada operator, has been added. It is intended to mark placeholder
    code that is not yet implemented. See &quot;Yada Yada Operator&quot; in

<p class="Pp">Using the <span class="Li">&quot;use VERSION&quot;</span> syntax
    with a version number greater or equal to 5.11.0 will lexically enable
    strictures just like <span class="Li">&quot;use strict&quot;</span> would do
    (in addition to enabling features.) The following:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    use 5.12.0;

<p class="Pp">It is now possible to overload the

    regexp, like it was already possible to overload conversion to boolean,
    string or number of objects. It is invoked when an object appears on the
    right hand side of the <span class="Li">&quot;=~&quot;</span> operator or
    when it is interpolated into a regexp. See overload.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Pluggable_keywords"><a class="permalink" href="#Pluggable_keywords">Pluggable
  keywords</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Extension modules can now cleanly hook into the Perl parser to
    define new kinds of keyword-headed expression and compound statement. The
    syntax following the keyword is defined entirely by the extension. This
    allows a completely non-Perl sublanguage to be parsed inline, with the
    correct ops cleanly generated.</p>
<p class="Pp">See &quot;PL_keyword_plugin&quot; in perlapi for the mechanism.
    The Perl core source distribution also includes a new module
    XS::APItest::KeywordRPN, which implements reverse Polish notation arithmetic
    via pluggable keywords. This module is mainly used for test purposes, and is
    not normally installed, but also serves as an example of how to use the new
    mechanism.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl's developers consider this feature to be experimental. We may
    remove it or change it in a backwards-incompatible way in Perl 5.14.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="APIs_for_more_internals"><a class="permalink" href="#APIs_for_more_internals">APIs

<p class="Pp">The lowest layers of the lexer and parts of the pad system now
    have C APIs available to XS extensions. These are necessary to support
    proper use of pluggable keywords, but have other uses too. The new APIs are
    experimental, and only cover a small proportion of what would be necessary
    to take full advantage of the core's facilities in these areas. It is
    intended that the Perl 5.13 development cycle will see the addition of a
    full range of clean, supported interfaces.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Overridable_function_lookup"><a class="permalink" href="#Overridable_function_lookup">Overridable
  function lookup</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Where an extension module hooks the creation of rv2cv ops to
    modify the subroutine lookup process, this now works correctly for bareword
    subroutine calls. This means that prototypes on subroutines referenced this
    way will be processed correctly. (Previously bareword subroutine names were
    initially looked up, for parsing purposes, by an unhookable mechanism, so
    extensions could only properly influence subroutine names that appeared with
    an <span class="Li">&quot;&amp;&quot;</span> sigil.)</p>

  proper interface for pluggable Method Resolution Orders</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">As of Perl 5.12.0 there is a new interface for plugging and using
    method resolution orders other than the default linear depth first search.
    The C3 method resolution order added in 5.10.0 has been re-implemented as a
    plugin, without changing its Perl-space interface. See perlmroapi for more
    information.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="_"><a class="permalink" href="#_">&quot;\N&quot; experimental
  regex escape</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Perl now supports <span class="Li">&quot;\N&quot;</span>, a new
    regex escape which you can think of as the inverse of
    <span class="Li">&quot;\n&quot;</span>. It will match any character that is
    not a newline, independently from the presence or absence of the single line
    match modifier <span class="Li">&quot;/s&quot;</span>. It is not usable
    within a character class. <span class="Li">&quot;\N{3}&quot;</span> means to
    match 3 non-newlines; <span class="Li">&quot;\N{5,}&quot;</span> means to
    match at least 5. <span class="Li">&quot;\N{NAME}&quot;</span> still means
    the character or sequence named <span class="Li">&quot;NAME&quot;</span>,
    but <span class="Li">&quot;NAME&quot;</span> no longer can be things like
    <span class="Li">3</span>, or <span class="Li">&quot;5,&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">This will break a custom charnames translator which allows numbers
    for character names, as <span class="Li">&quot;\N{3}&quot;</span> will now
    mean to match 3 non-newline characters, and not the character whose name is
    <span class="Li">3</span>. (No name defined by the Unicode standard is a
    number, so only custom translators might be affected.)</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl's developers are somewhat concerned about possible user
    confusion with the existing <span class="Li">&quot;\N{...}&quot;</span>
    construct which matches characters by their Unicode name. Consequently, this
    feature is experimental. We may remove it or change it in a
    backwards-incompatible way in Perl 5.14.</p>

<p class="Pp">Over the years, Perl's developers have deprecated a number of
    language features for a variety of reasons. Perl now defaults to issuing a
    warning if a deprecated language feature is used. Many of the deprecations
    Perl now warns you about have been deprecated for many years. You can find a

    <span class="Li">&quot;perl5xxdelta.pod&quot;</span> file for that

<h2 class="Ss" id="Version_number_formats"><a class="permalink" href="#Version_number_formats">Version
  number formats</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Acceptable version number formats have been formalized into
    &quot;strict&quot; and &quot;lax&quot; rules. <span class="Li">&quot;package
    NAME VERSION&quot;</span> takes a strict version number.
    <span class="Li">&quot;UNIVERSAL::VERSION&quot;</span> and the version
    object constructors take lax version numbers. Providing an invalid version
    will result in a fatal error. The version argument in
    <span class="Li">&quot;use NAME VERSION&quot;</span> is first parsed as a
    numeric literal or v-string and then passed to
    <span class="Li">&quot;UNIVERSAL::VERSION&quot;</span> (and must then pass
    the &quot;lax&quot; format test).</p>
<p class="Pp">These formats are documented fully in the version module. To a
    first approximation, a &quot;strict&quot; version number is a positive
    decimal number (integer or decimal-fraction) without exponentiation or else
    a dotted-decimal v-string with a leading 'v' character and at least three
    components. A &quot;lax&quot; version number allows v-strings with fewer
    than three components or without a leading 'v'. Under &quot;lax&quot; rules,
    both decimal and dotted-decimal versions may have a trailing
    &quot;alpha&quot; component separated by an underscore character after a
    fractional or dotted-decimal component.</p>
<p class="Pp">The version module adds
    <span class="Li">&quot;version::is_strict&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;version::is_lax&quot;</span> functions to check a
    scalar against these rules.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Switch_statement_changes"><a class="permalink" href="#Switch_statement_changes">Switch
  statement changes</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The
    <span class="Li">&quot;given&quot;</span>/<span class="Li">&quot;when&quot;</span>
    switch statement handles complex statements better than Perl 5.10.0 did
    (These enhancements are also available in 5.10.1 and subsequent 5.10
    releases.) There are two new cases where
    <span class="Li">&quot;when&quot;</span> now interprets its argument as a
    boolean, instead of an expression to be used in a smart match:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="flip-flop"><a class="permalink" href="#flip-flop">flip-flop
    operators</a></dt>
  <dd>The <span class="Li">&quot;..&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;...&quot;</span> flip-flop operators are now
      evaluated in boolean context, following their usual semantics; see
      &quot;Range Operators&quot; in perlop.
    <p class="Pp">Note that, as in perl 5.10.0, <span class="Li">&quot;when
        (1..10)&quot;</span> will not work to test whether a given value is an
        integer between 1 and 10; you should use <span class="Li">&quot;when
        ([1..10])&quot;</span> instead (note the array reference).</p>
    <p class="Pp">However, contrary to 5.10.0, evaluating the flip-flop
        operators in boolean context ensures it can now be useful in a
        <span class="Li">&quot;when()&quot;</span>, notably for implementing
        bistable conditions, like in:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    when (/^=begin/ .. /^=end/) {
      # do something
    }
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt id="defined-or"><a class="permalink" href="#defined-or">defined-or
    operator</a></dt>
  <dd>A compound expression involving the defined-or operator, as in
      <span class="Li">&quot;when (expr1 // expr2)&quot;</span>, will be treated
      as boolean if the first expression is boolean. (This just extends the
      existing rule that applies to the regular or operator, as in
      <span class="Li">&quot;when (expr1 || expr2)&quot;</span>.)</dd>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Smart_match_changes"><a class="permalink" href="#Smart_match_changes">Smart
  match changes</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Since Perl 5.10.0, Perl's developers have made a number of changes
    to the smart match operator. These, of course, also alter the behaviour of
    the switch statements where smart matching is implicitly used. These changes
    were also made for the 5.10.1 release, and will remain in subsequent 5.10
    releases.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Changes to type-based dispatch</i></p>
<p class="Pp">The smart match operator <span class="Li">&quot;~~&quot;</span> is
    no longer commutative. The behaviour of a smart match now depends primarily
    on the type of its right hand argument. Moreover, its semantics have been
    adjusted for greater consistency or usefulness in several cases. While the
    general backwards compatibility is maintained, several changes must be
    noted:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Code references with an empty prototype are no longer treated specially.
      They are passed an argument like the other code references (even if they
      choose to ignore it).</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;%hash ~~ sub {}&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;@array ~~ sub {}&quot;</span> now test that the
      subroutine returns a true value for each key of the hash (or element of
      the array), instead of passing the whole hash or array as a reference to
      the subroutine.</li>
  <li>Due to the commutativity breakage, code references are no longer treated
      specially when appearing on the left of the
      <span class="Li">&quot;~~&quot;</span> operator, but like any vulgar
      scalar.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;undef ~~ %hash&quot;</span> is always false (since
      <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> can't be a key in a hash). No
      implicit conversion to <span class="Li">&quot;&quot;</span> is done (as
      was the case in perl 5.10.0).</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;$scalar ~~ @array&quot;</span> now always
      distributes the smart match across the elements of the array. It's true if
      one element in <span class="Li">@array</span> verifies
      <span class="Li">&quot;$scalar ~~ $element&quot;</span>. This is a
      generalization of the old behaviour that tested whether the array
      contained the scalar.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">The full dispatch table for the smart match operator is given in
    &quot;Smart matching in detail&quot; in perlsyn.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Smart match and overloading</i></p>
<p class="Pp">According to the rule of dispatch based on the rightmost argument
    type, when an object overloading <span class="Li">&quot;~~&quot;</span>
    appears on the right side of the operator, the overload routine will always
    be called (with a 3rd argument set to a true value, see overload.) However,
    when the object will appear on the left, the overload routine will be called
    only when the rightmost argument is a simple scalar. This way,
    distributivity of smart match across arrays is not broken, as well as the
    other behaviours with complex types (coderefs, hashes, regexes). Thus,
    writers of overloading routines for smart match mostly need to worry only
    with comparing against a scalar, and possibly with stringification
    overloading; the other common cases will be automatically handled
    consistently.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;~~&quot;</span> will now refuse to work on
    objects that do not overload it (in order to avoid relying on the object's
    underlying structure). (However, if the object overloads the stringification
    or the numification operators, and if overload fallback is active, it will
    be used instead, as usual.)</p>

<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>The definitions of a number of Unicode properties have changed to match

  <li>The semantics of <span class="Li">&quot;use feature :5.10*&quot;</span>
      have changed slightly. See &quot;Modules and Pragmata&quot; for more
      information.</li>
  <li>Perl's developers now use git, rather than Perforce. This should be a
      purely internal change only relevant to people actively working on the
      core. However, you may see minor difference in perl as a consequence of
      the change. For example in some of details of the output of

    <p class="Pp">This allows a build to complete with PERL_UNICODE set and a

<h1 class="Sh" id="Deprecations"><a class="permalink" href="#Deprecations">Deprecations</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">From time to time, Perl's developers find it necessary to
    deprecate features or modules we've previously shipped as part of the core
    distribution. We are well aware of the pain and frustration that a
    backwards-incompatible change to Perl can cause for developers building or
    maintaining software in Perl. You can be sure that when we deprecate a
    functionality or syntax, it isn't a choice we make lightly. Sometimes, we
    choose to deprecate functionality or syntax because it was found to be
    poorly designed or implemented. Sometimes, this is because they're holding
    back other features or causing performance problems. Sometimes, the reasons
    are more complex. Wherever possible, we try to keep deprecated functionality
    available to developers in its previous form for at least one major release.
    So long as a deprecated feature isn't actively disrupting our ability to
    maintain and extend Perl, we'll try to leave it in place as long as
    possible.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following items are now deprecated:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="suidperl"><a class="permalink" href="#suidperl">suidperl</a></dt>
  <dd><span class="Li">&quot;suidperl&quot;</span> is no longer part of Perl. It
      used to provide a mechanism to emulate setuid permission bits on systems
      that don't support it properly.</dd>
  <dt id="Use"><a class="permalink" href="#Use">Use of &quot;:=&quot; to mean an
    empty attribute list</a></dt>
  <dd>An accident of Perl's parser meant that these constructions were all
      equivalent:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    my $pi := 4;
    my $pi : = 4;
    my $pi :  = 4;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">with the <span class="Li">&quot;:&quot;</span> being treated
        as the start of an attribute list, which ends before the
        <span class="Li">&quot;=&quot;</span>. As whitespace is not significant
        here, all are parsed as an empty attribute list, hence all the above are
        equivalent to, and better written as</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    my $pi = 4;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">because no attribute processing is done for an empty list.</p>
    <p class="Pp">As is, this meant that <span class="Li">&quot;:=&quot;</span>
        cannot be used as a new token, without silently changing the meaning of
        existing code. Hence that particular form is now deprecated, and will
        become a syntax error. If it is absolutely necessary to have empty
        attribute lists (for example, because of a code generator) then avoid
        the warning by adding a space before the
        <span class="Li">&quot;=&quot;</span>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>&quot;UNIVERSAL-&gt;import()&quot;</dt>
  <dd>The method <span class="Li">&quot;UNIVERSAL-&gt;import()&quot;</span> is
      now deprecated. Attempting to pass import arguments to a
      <span class="Li">&quot;use UNIVERSAL&quot;</span> statement will result in
      a deprecation warning.</dd>
  <dt id="Use~2"><a class="permalink" href="#Use~2">Use of &quot;goto&quot; to
    jump into a construct</a></dt>
  <dd>Using <span class="Li">&quot;goto&quot;</span> to jump from an outer scope
      into an inner scope is now deprecated. This rare use case was causing
      problems in the implementation of scopes.</dd>
  <dt id="Custom"><a class="permalink" href="#Custom">Custom character names in
    \N{name} that don't look like names</a></dt>
  <dd>In
      <span class="Li">&quot;\N{</span><span class="Li"><i>name</i></span><span class="Li">}&quot;</span>,
      <i>name</i> can be just about anything. The standard Unicode names have a
      very limited domain, but a custom name translator could create names that
      are, for example, made up entirely of punctuation symbols. It is now
      deprecated to make names that don't begin with an alphabetic character,
      and aren't alphanumeric or contain other than a very few other characters,
      namely spaces, dashes, parentheses and colons. Because of the added
      meaning of <span class="Li">&quot;\N&quot;</span> (See
      <span class="Li">&quot;&quot;\N&quot;</span> <span class="Li">experimental
      regex escape&quot;</span>), names that look like curly brace -enclosed
      quantifiers won't work. For example,
      <span class="Li">&quot;\N{3,4}&quot;</span> now means to match 3 to 4
      non-newlines; before a custom name <span class="Li">&quot;3,4&quot;</span>
      could have been created.</dd>
  <dt id="Deprecated"><a class="permalink" href="#Deprecated">Deprecated
    Modules</a></dt>
  <dd>The following modules will be removed from the core distribution in a
      future release, and should be installed from CPAN instead. Distributions
      on CPAN which require these should add them to their prerequisites. The
      core versions of these modules warnings will issue a deprecation warning.
    <p class="Pp">If you ship a packaged version of Perl, either alone or as
        part of a larger system, then you should carefully consider the
        repercussions of core module deprecations. You may want to consider
        shipping your default build of Perl with packages for some or all
        deprecated modules which install into
        <span class="Li">&quot;vendor&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;site&quot;</span> perl library directories. This
        will inhibit the deprecation warnings.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Alternatively, you may want to consider patching
        <i>lib/deprecate.pm</i> to provide deprecation warnings specific to your
        packaging system or distribution of Perl, consistent with how your
        packaging system or distribution manages a staged transition from a
        release where the installation of a single package provides the given
        functionality, to a later release where the system administrator needs
        to know to install multiple packages to get that same functionality.</p>
    <p class="Pp">You can silence these deprecation warnings by installing the
        modules in question from CPAN. To install the latest version of all of
        them, just install
        <span class="Li">&quot;Task::Deprecations::5_12&quot;</span>.</p>

        release.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="Unicode_overhaul"><a class="permalink" href="#Unicode_overhaul">Unicode
  overhaul</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Perl's developers have made a concerted effort to update Perl to
    be in sync with the latest Unicode standard. Changes for this include:</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl can now handle every Unicode character property. New
    documentation, perluniprops, lists all available non-Unihan character
    properties. By default, perl does not expose Unihan, deprecated or
    Unicode-internal properties. See below for more details on these; there is
    also a section in the pod listing them, and explaining why they are not
    exposed.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl now fully supports the Unicode compound-style of using
    <span class="Li">&quot;=&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;:&quot;</span> in writing regular expressions:
    <span class="Li">&quot;\p{property=value}&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;\p{property:value}&quot;</span> (both of which mean
    the same thing).</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl now fully supports the Unicode loose matching rules for text
    between the braces in <span class="Li">&quot;\p{...}&quot;</span>
    constructs. In addition, Perl allows underscores between digits of
  numbers.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl now accepts all the Unicode-defined synonyms for properties
    and property values.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;qr/\X/&quot;</span>, which matches a
    Unicode logical character, has been expanded to work better with various
    Asian languages. It now is defined as an <i>extended grapheme cluster</i>.
    (See &lt;http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr29/&gt;). Anything matched
    previously and that made sense will continue to be accepted.
  Additionally:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;\X&quot;</span> will not break apart a
      <span class="Li">&quot;CR&#x00A0;LF&quot;</span> sequence.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;\X&quot;</span> will now match a sequence which
      includes the <span class="Li">&quot;ZWJ&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;ZWNJ&quot;</span> characters.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;\X&quot;</span> will now always match at least one
      character, including an initial mark. Marks generally come after a base
      character, but it is possible in Unicode to have them in isolation, and
      <span class="Li">&quot;\X&quot;</span> will now handle that case, for
      example at the beginning of a line, or after a
      <span class="Li">&quot;ZWSP&quot;</span>. And this is the part where
      <span class="Li">&quot;\X&quot;</span> doesn't match the things that it
      used to that don't make sense. Formerly, for example, you could have the
      nonsensical case of an accented LF.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;\X&quot;</span> will now match a (Korean) Hangul
      syllable sequence, and the Thai and Lao exception cases.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">Otherwise, this change should be transparent for the non-affected
    languages.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;\p{...}&quot;</span> matches using the
    Canonical_Combining_Class property were completely broken in previous
    releases of Perl. They should now work correctly.</p>
<p class="Pp">Before Perl 5.12, the Unicode
    <span class="Li">&quot;Decomposition_Type=Compat&quot;</span> property and a
    Perl extension had the same name, which led to neither matching all the
    correct values (with more than 100 mistakes in one, and several thousand in
    the other). The Perl extension has now been renamed to be
    <span class="Li">&quot;Decomposition_Type=Noncanonical&quot;</span> (short:
    <span class="Li">&quot;dt=noncanon&quot;</span>). It has the same meaning as
    was previously intended, namely the union of all the non-canonical
    Decomposition types, with Unicode <span class="Li">&quot;Compat&quot;</span>
    being just one of those.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;\p{Decomposition_Type=Canonical}&quot;</span>
    now includes the Hangul syllables.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;\p{Uppercase}&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;\p{Lowercase}&quot;</span> now work as the Unicode
    standard says they should. This means they each match a few more characters
    than they used to.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;\p{Cntrl}&quot;</span> now matches the same
    characters as <span class="Li">&quot;\p{Control}&quot;</span>. This means it
    no longer will match Private Use (gc=co), Surrogates (gc=cs), nor Format
    (gc=cf) code points. The Format code points represent the biggest possible
    problem. All but 36 of them are either officially deprecated or strongly
    discouraged from being used. Of those 36, likely the most widely used are
    the soft hyphen (U+00AD), and BOM, ZWSP, ZWNJ, WJ, and similar characters,
    plus bidirectional controls.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;\p{Alpha}&quot;</span> now matches the same
    characters as <span class="Li">&quot;\p{Alphabetic}&quot;</span>. Before
    5.12, Perl's definition included a number of things that aren't really alpha
    (all marks) while omitting many that were. The definitions of
    <span class="Li">&quot;\p{Alnum}&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;\p{Word}&quot;</span> depend on Alpha's definition
    and have changed accordingly.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;\p{Word}&quot;</span> no longer incorrectly
    matches non-word characters such as fractions.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;\p{Print}&quot;</span> no longer matches
    the line control characters: Tab, LF, CR, FF, VT, and NEL. This brings it in
    line with standards and the documentation.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;\p{XDigit}&quot;</span> now matches the
    same characters as <span class="Li">&quot;\p{Hex_Digit}&quot;</span>. This
    means that in addition to the characters it currently matches,
    <span class="Li">&quot;[A-Fa-f0-9]&quot;</span>, it will also match the 22
    fullwidth equivalents, for example U+FF10: FULLWIDTH DIGIT ZERO.</p>
<p class="Pp">The Numeric type property has been extended to include the Unihan
    characters.</p>
<p class="Pp">There is a new Perl extension, the 'Present_In', or simply 'In',
    property. This is an extension of the Unicode Age property, but
    <span class="Li">&quot;\p{In=5.0}&quot;</span> matches any code point whose
    usage has been determined <i>as of</i> Unicode version 5.0. The
    <span class="Li">&quot;\p{Age=5.0}&quot;</span> only matches code points
    added in <i>precisely</i> version 5.0.</p>
<p class="Pp">A number of properties now have the correct values for unassigned
    code points. The affected properties are Bidi_Class, East_Asian_Width,
    Joining_Type, Decomposition_Type, Hangul_Syllable_Type, Numeric_Type, and
    Line_Break.</p>
<p class="Pp">The Default_Ignorable_Code_Point, ID_Continue, and ID_Start
    properties are now up to date with current Unicode definitions.</p>
<p class="Pp">Earlier versions of Perl erroneously exposed certain properties
    that are supposed to be Unicode internal-only. Use of these in regular
    expressions will now generate, if enabled, a deprecation warning message.
    The properties are: Other_Alphabetic, Other_Default_Ignorable_Code_Point,
    Other_Grapheme_Extend, Other_ID_Continue, Other_ID_Start, Other_Lowercase,
    Other_Math, and Other_Uppercase.</p>
<p class="Pp">It is now possible to change which Unicode properties Perl
    understands on a per-installation basis. As mentioned above, certain
    properties are turned off by default. These include all the Unihan
    properties (which should be accessible via the CPAN module Unicode::Unihan)
    and any deprecated or Unicode internal-only property that Perl has never
    exposed.</p>
<p class="Pp">The generated files in the
    <span class="Li">&quot;lib/unicore/To&quot;</span> directory are now more
    clearly marked as being stable, directly usable by applications. New hash
    entries in them give the format of the normal entries, which allows for
    easier machine parsing. Perl can generate files in this directory for any
    property, though most are suppressed. You can find instructions for changing
    which are written in perluniprops.</p>

  <dt>&quot;charnames&quot;</dt>

      <span class="Li">&quot;:5.10&quot;</span> and

      slightly. The last component, if any (i.e.
      <span class="Li">&quot;X&quot;</span>) is simply ignored. This is
      predicated on the assumption that new features will not, in general, be
      added to maintenance releases. So
      <span class="Li">&quot;:5.10&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;:5.10.X&quot;</span> have identical effect. This is
      a change to the behaviour documented for 5.10.0.

  to Existing Documentation</a></h2>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>The various large <i>Changes*</i> files (which listed every change made to
      perl over the last 18 years) have been removed, and replaced by a small
      file, also called <i>Changes</i>, which just explains how that same
      information may be extracted from the git version control system.</li>
  <li><i>Porting/patching.pod</i> has been deleted, as it mainly described
      interacting with the old Perforce-based repository, which is now obsolete.
      Information still relevant has been moved to perlrepository.</li>
  <li>The syntax <span class="Li">&quot;unless (EXPR) BLOCK else
      BLOCK&quot;</span> is now documented as valid, as is the syntax
      <span class="Li">&quot;unless (EXPR) BLOCK elsif (EXPR) BLOCK ...
      else</span> <span class="Li">BLOCK&quot;</span>, although actually using
      the latter may not be the best idea for the readability of your source
      code.</li>
  <li>Documented -X overloading.</li>
  <li>Documented that <span class="Li">&quot;when()&quot;</span> treats
      specially most of the filetest operators</li>
  <li>Documented <span class="Li">&quot;when&quot;</span> as a syntax
    modifier.</li>
  <li>Eliminated &quot;Old Perl threads tutorial&quot;, which described 5005
      threads.
    <p class="Pp"><i>pod/perlthrtut.pod</i> is the same material reworked for
        ithreads.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Correct previous documentation: v-strings are not deprecated
    <p class="Pp">With version objects, we need them to use MODULE VERSION
        syntax. This patch removes the deprecation notice.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Security contact information is now part of perlsec.</li>
  <li>A significant fraction of the core documentation has been updated to
      clarify the behavior of Perl's Unicode handling.
    <p class="Pp">Much of the remaining core documentation has been reviewed and
        edited for clarity, consistent use of language, and to fix the spelling
        of Tom Christiansen's name.</p>
  </li>
  <li>The Pod specification (perlpodspec) has been updated to bring the
      specification in line with modern usage already supported by most Pod
      systems. A parameter string may now follow the format name in a
      &quot;begin/end&quot; region. Links to URIs with a text description are
      now allowed. The usage of
      <span class="Li">&quot;L&lt;&quot;section&quot;&gt;&quot;</span> has been
      marked as deprecated.</li>
  <li>if.pm has been documented in &quot;use&quot; in perlfunc as a means to get
      conditional loading of modules despite the implicit BEGIN block around
      <span class="Li">&quot;use&quot;</span>.</li>
  <li>The documentation for <span class="Li">$1</span> in perlvar.pod has been
      clarified.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;\N{U+</span><span class="Li"><i>code
      point</i></span><span class="Li">}&quot;</span> is now documented.</li>

  <li>Under <span class="Li">&quot;use locale&quot;</span>, the locale-relevant
      information is now cached on read-only values, such as the list returned
      by <span class="Li">&quot;keys %hash&quot;</span>. This makes operations
      such as <span class="Li">&quot;sort keys %hash&quot;</span> in the scope
      of <span class="Li">&quot;use locale&quot;</span> much faster.</li>
  <li>Empty <span class="Li">&quot;DESTROY&quot;</span> methods are no longer
      called.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;Perl_sv_utf8_upgrade()&quot;</span> is now

  <li><span class="Li">&quot;keys&quot;</span> on empty hash is now faster.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;if (%foo)&quot;</span> has been optimized to be
      faster than <span class="Li">&quot;if (keys %foo)&quot;</span>.</li>
  <li>The string repetition operator (<span class="Li">&quot;$str x
      $num&quot;</span>) is now several times faster when
      <span class="Li">$str</span> has length one or
      <span class="Li">$num</span> is large.</li>
  <li>Reversing an array to itself (as in <span class="Li">&quot;@a = reverse
      @a&quot;</span>) in void context now happens in-place and is several
      orders of magnitude faster than it used to be. It will also preserve
      non-existent elements whenever possible, i.e. for non magical arrays or
      tied arrays with <span class="Li">&quot;EXISTS&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;DELETE&quot;</span> methods.</li>

<h1 class="Sh" id="Internal_Changes"><a class="permalink" href="#Internal_Changes">Internal
  Changes</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Each release of Perl sees numerous internal changes which
    shouldn't affect day to day usage but may still be notable for developers
    working with Perl's source code.</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>The J.R.R. Tolkien quotes at the head of C source file have been checked
      and proper citations added, thanks to a patch from Tom Christiansen.</li>
  <li>The internal structure of the dual-life modules traditionally found in the
      <i>lib/</i> and <i>ext/</i> directories in the perl source has changed
      significantly. Where possible, dual-lifed modules have been extracted from
      <i>lib/</i> and <i>ext/</i>.
    <p class="Pp">Dual-lifed modules maintained by Perl's developers as part of
        the Perl core now live in <i>dist/</i>. Dual-lifed modules maintained
        primarily on CPAN now live in <i>cpan/</i>. When reporting a bug in a
        module located under <i>cpan/</i>, please send your bug report directly
        to the module's bug tracker or author, rather than Perl's bug
      tracker.</p>
  </li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;\N{...}&quot;</span> now compiles better, always
      forces UTF-8 internal representation
    <p class="Pp">Perl's developers have fixed several problems with the
        recognition of <span class="Li">&quot;\N{...}&quot;</span> constructs.
        As part of this, perl will store any scalar or regex containing
        <span class="Li">&quot;\N{</span><span class="Li"><i>name</i></span><span class="Li">}&quot;</span>
        or <span class="Li">&quot;\N{U+</span><span class="Li"><i>code
        point</i></span><span class="Li">}&quot;</span> in its definition in
        UTF-8 format. (This was true previously for all occurrences of
        <span class="Li">&quot;\N{</span><span class="Li"><i>name</i></span><span class="Li">}&quot;</span>
        that did not use a custom translator, but now it's always true.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>Perl_magic_setmglob now knows about globs, fixing RT #71254.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;SVt_RV&quot;</span> no longer exists. RVs are now
      stored in IVs.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;Perl_vcroak()&quot;</span> now accepts a null first
      argument. In addition, a full audit was made of the &quot;not NULL&quot;
      compiler annotations, and those for several other internal functions were
      corrected.</li>
  <li>New macros <span class="Li">&quot;dSAVEDERRNO&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;dSAVE_ERRNO&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;SAVE_ERRNO&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;RESTORE_ERRNO&quot;</span> have been added to
      formalise the temporary saving of the
      <span class="Li">&quot;errno&quot;</span> variable.</li>
  <li>The function <span class="Li">&quot;Perl_sv_insert_flags&quot;</span> has
      been added to augment
    <span class="Li">&quot;Perl_sv_insert&quot;</span>.</li>
  <li>The function <span class="Li">&quot;Perl_newSV_type(type)&quot;</span> has
      been added, equivalent to <span class="Li">&quot;Perl_newSV()&quot;</span>
      followed by
    <span class="Li">&quot;Perl_sv_upgrade(type)&quot;</span>.</li>
  <li>The function <span class="Li">&quot;Perl_newSVpvn_flags()&quot;</span> has
      been added, equivalent to
      <span class="Li">&quot;Perl_newSVpvn()&quot;</span> and then performing
      the action relevant to the flag.
    <p class="Pp">Two flag bits are currently supported.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;SVf_UTF8&quot;</span> will call
      <span class="Li">&quot;SvUTF8_on()&quot;</span> for you. (Note that this
      does not convert a sequence of ISO 8859-1 characters to UTF-8). A wrapper,
      <span class="Li">&quot;newSVpvn_utf8()&quot;</span> is available for
    this.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;SVs_TEMP&quot;</span> now calls
      <span class="Li">&quot;Perl_sv_2mortal()&quot;</span> on the new SV.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">There is also a wrapper that takes constant strings,
    <span class="Li">&quot;newSVpvs_flags()&quot;</span>.</p>
</div>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>The function <span class="Li">&quot;Perl_croak_xs_usage&quot;</span> has
      been added as a wrapper to
    <span class="Li">&quot;Perl_croak&quot;</span>.</li>
  <li>Perl now exports the functions
      <span class="Li">&quot;PerlIO_find_layer&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;PerlIO_list_alloc&quot;</span>.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;PL_na&quot;</span> has been exterminated from the
      core code, replaced by local STRLEN temporaries, or
      <span class="Li">&quot;*_nolen()&quot;</span> calls. Either approach is
      faster than <span class="Li">&quot;PL_na&quot;</span>, which is a pointer
      dereference into the interpreter structure under ithreads, and a global
      variable otherwise.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;Perl_mg_free()&quot;</span> used to leave freed
      memory accessible via <span class="Li">&quot;SvMAGIC()&quot;</span> on the
      scalar. It now updates the linked list to remove each piece of magic as it
      is freed.</li>
  <li>Under ithreads, the regex in
      <span class="Li">&quot;PL_reg_curpm&quot;</span> is now reference counted.
      This eliminates a lot of hackish workarounds to cope with it not being
      reference counted.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;Perl_mg_magical()&quot;</span> would sometimes
      incorrectly turn on <span class="Li">&quot;SvRMAGICAL()&quot;</span>. This
      has been fixed.</li>
  <li>The <i>public</i> IV and NV flags are now not set if the string value has
      trailing &quot;garbage&quot;. This behaviour is consistent with not
      setting the public IV or NV flags if the value is out of range for the
      type.</li>
  <li>Uses of <span class="Li">&quot;Nullav&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;Nullcv&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;Nullhv&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;Nullop&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;Nullsv&quot;</span> etc have been replaced by
      <span class="Li">&quot;NULL&quot;</span> in the core code, and
      non-dual-life modules, as <span class="Li">&quot;NULL&quot;</span> is
      clearer to those unfamiliar with the core code.</li>
  <li>A macro <span class="Li">MUTABLE_PTR(p)</span> has been added, which on
      (non-pedantic) gcc will not cast away
      <span class="Li">&quot;const&quot;</span>, returning a
      <span class="Li">&quot;void *&quot;</span>. Macros
      <span class="Li">&quot;MUTABLE_SV(av)&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;MUTABLE_SV(cv)&quot;</span> etc build on this,
      casting to <span class="Li">&quot;AV *&quot;</span> etc without casting
      away <span class="Li">&quot;const&quot;</span>. This allows proper
      compile-time auditing of <span class="Li">&quot;const&quot;</span>
      correctness in the core, and helped picked up some errors (now
    fixed).</li>
  <li>Macros <span class="Li">&quot;mPUSHs()&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;mXPUSHs()&quot;</span> have been added, for pushing
      SVs on the stack and mortalizing them.</li>
  <li>Use of the private structure <span class="Li">&quot;mro_meta&quot;</span>
      has changed slightly. Nothing outside the core should be accessing this
      directly anyway.</li>
  <li>A new tool, <i>Porting/expand-macro.pl</i> has been added, that allows you
      to view how a C preprocessor macro would be expanded when compiled. This
      is handy when trying to decode the macro hell that is the perl guts.</li>

  <dd>The core distribution can now run its regression tests in parallel on
      Unix-like platforms. Instead of running <span class="Li">&quot;make
      test&quot;</span>, set <span class="Li">&quot;TEST_JOBS&quot;</span> in
      your environment to the number of tests to run in parallel, and run
      <span class="Li">&quot;make test_harness&quot;</span>. On a Bourne-like
      shell, this can be done as
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    TEST_JOBS=3 make test_harness  # Run 3 tests in parallel
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">An environment variable is used, rather than parallel make
        itself, because TAP::Harness needs to be able to schedule individual
        non-conflicting test scripts itself, and there is no standard interface
        to <span class="Li">&quot;make&quot;</span> utilities to interact with
        their job schedulers.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that currently some test scripts may fail when run in
        parallel (most notably
        <span class="Li">&quot;ext/IO/t/io_dir.t&quot;</span>). If necessary run
        just the failing scripts again sequentially and see if the failures go

  <dd>Several tests that have the potential to hang forever if they fail now

      <span class="Li">&quot;$re = '\N{SPACE}'; /$re/;&quot;</span>. See
      perldiag for more examples of how the lexer can get bypassed.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;Invalid hexadecimal number in
      \N{U+...}&quot;</span> is a new fatal error triggered when the character
      constant represented by <span class="Li">&quot;...&quot;</span> is not a
      valid hexadecimal number.</li>
  <li>The new meaning of <span class="Li">&quot;\N&quot;</span> as
      <span class="Li">&quot;[^\n]&quot;</span> is not valid in a bracketed
      character class, just like <span class="Li">&quot;.&quot;</span> in a
      character class loses its special meaning, and will cause the fatal error
      <span class="Li">&quot;\N in a character class must be a named</span>
      <span class="Li">character: \N{...}&quot;</span>.</li>
  <li>The rules on what is legal for the <span class="Li">&quot;...&quot;</span>
      in <span class="Li">&quot;\N{...}&quot;</span> have been tightened up so
      that unless the <span class="Li">&quot;...&quot;</span> begins with an
      alphabetic character and continues with a combination of alphanumerics,
      dashes, spaces, parentheses or colons then the warning
      <span class="Li">&quot;Deprecated character(s)</span> <span class="Li">in
      \N{...} starting at '%s'&quot;</span> is now issued.</li>
  <li>The warning <span class="Li">&quot;Using just the first characters
      returned by \N{}&quot;</span> will be issued if the
      <span class="Li">&quot;charnames&quot;</span> handler returns a sequence
      of characters which exceeds the limit of the number of characters that can
      be used. The message will indicate which characters were used and which
      were discarded.</li>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Changed_Diagnostics"><a class="permalink" href="#Changed_Diagnostics">Changed
  Diagnostics</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">A number of existing diagnostic messages have been improved or
    corrected:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd>A new warning category <span class="Li">&quot;illegalproto&quot;</span>
      allows finer-grained control of warnings around function prototypes.
    <p class="Pp">The two warnings:</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>&quot;Illegal character in prototype for %s : %s&quot;</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>&quot;Prototype after '%c' for %s : %s&quot;</dt>
  <dd></dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">have been moved from the
    <span class="Li">&quot;syntax&quot;</span> top-level warnings category into
    a new first-level category,
    <span class="Li">&quot;illegalproto&quot;</span>. These two warnings are
    currently the only ones emitted during parsing of an invalid/illegal
    prototype, so one can now use</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  no warnings 'illegalproto';
</pre>
<p class="Pp">to suppress only those, but not other syntax-related warnings.
    Warnings where prototypes are changed, ignored, or not met are still in the
    <span class="Li">&quot;prototype&quot;</span> category as before.</p>
</div>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;Deep recursion on subroutine
      &quot;%s&quot;&quot;</span>
    <p class="Pp">It is now possible to change the depth threshold for this
        warning from the default of 100, by recompiling the <i>perl</i> binary,
        setting the C pre-processor macro
        <span class="Li">&quot;PERL_SUB_DEPTH_WARN&quot;</span> to the desired
        value.</p>
  </li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;Illegal character in prototype&quot;</span> warning
      is now more precise when reporting illegal characters after _</li>
  <li>mro merging error messages are now very similar to those produced by
      Algorithm::C3.</li>
  <li>Amelioration of the error message &quot;Unrecognized character
      <span class="Li">%s</span> in column <span class="Li">%d</span>&quot;
    <p class="Pp">Changes the error message to &quot;Unrecognized character
        <span class="Li">%s</span>; marked by &lt;-- HERE after
        <span class="Li">%s</span>&lt;-- HERE near column
        <span class="Li">%d</span>&quot;. This should make it a little simpler
        to spot and correct the suspicious character.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Perl now explicitly points to <span class="Li">$.</span> when it causes an
      uninitialized warning for ranges in scalar context.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;split&quot;</span> now warns when called in void
      context.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;printf&quot;</span>-style functions called with too
      few arguments will now issue the warning <span class="Li">&quot;Missing
      argument in %s&quot;</span> [perl #71000]</li>
  <li>Perl now properly returns a syntax error instead of segfaulting if
      <span class="Li">&quot;each&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;keys&quot;</span>, or
      <span class="Li">&quot;values&quot;</span> is used without an
    argument.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;tell()&quot;</span> now fails properly if called
      without an argument and when no previous file was read.
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;tell()&quot;</span> now returns
        <span class="Li">&quot;-1&quot;</span>, and sets errno to
        <span class="Li">&quot;EBADF&quot;</span>, thus restoring the 5.8.x
        behaviour.</p>
  </li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;overload&quot;</span> no longer implicitly unsets
      fallback on repeated 'use overload' lines.</li>
  <li><b>POSIX::strftime()</b> can now handle Unicode characters in the format
      string.</li>
  <li>The <span class="Li">&quot;syntax&quot;</span> category was removed from 5
      warnings that should only be in
      <span class="Li">&quot;deprecated&quot;</span>.</li>
  <li>Three fatal
      <span class="Li">&quot;pack&quot;</span>/<span class="Li">&quot;unpack&quot;</span>
      error messages have been normalized to <span class="Li">&quot;panic:
      %s&quot;</span></li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;Unicode character is illegal&quot;</span> has been
      rephrased to be more accurate
    <p class="Pp">It now reads <span class="Li">&quot;Unicode non-character is
        illegal in interchange&quot;</span> and the perldiag documentation has
        been expanded a bit.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Currently, all but the first of the several characters that the
      <span class="Li">&quot;charnames&quot;</span> handler may return are
      discarded when used in a regular expression pattern bracketed character
      class. If this happens then the warning <span class="Li">&quot;Using just
      the first character returned by \N{} in character</span>
      <span class="Li">class&quot;</span> will be issued.</li>
  <li>The warning <span class="Li">&quot;Missing right brace on \N{} or
      unescaped left brace after</span> <span class="Li">\N. Assuming the
      latter&quot;</span> will be issued if Perl encounters a
      <span class="Li">&quot;\N{&quot;</span> but doesn't find a matching
      <span class="Li">&quot;}&quot;</span>. In this case Perl doesn't know if
      it was mistakenly omitted, or if &quot;match non-newline&quot; followed by
      &quot;match a <span class="Li">&quot;{&quot;</span>&quot; was desired. It
      assumes the latter because that is actually a valid interpretation as
      written, unlike the other case. If you meant the former, you need to add
      the matching right brace. If you did mean the latter, you can silence this
      warning by writing instead <span class="Li">&quot;\N\{&quot;</span>.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;gmtime&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;localtime&quot;</span> called with numbers smaller
      than they can reliably handle will now issue the warnings
      <span class="Li">&quot;gmtime(%.0f) too small&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;localtime(%.0f) too small&quot;</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">The following diagnostic messages have been removed:</p>

  <li><span class="Li">&quot;Runaway format&quot;</span></li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;Can't locate package %s for the parents of
      %s&quot;</span>
    <p class="Pp">In general this warning it only got produced in conjunction
        with other warnings, and removing it allowed an ISA lookup optimisation
        to be added.</p>

  <li><i>h2ph</i> now looks in <span class="Li">&quot;include-fixed&quot;</span>
      too, which is a recent addition to gcc's search path.</li>
  <li><i>h2xs</i> no longer incorrectly treats enum values like macros. It also
      now handles C++ style comments (<span class="Li">&quot;//&quot;</span>)
      properly in enums.</li>
  <li><i>perl5db.pl</i> now supports <span class="Li">&quot;LVALUE&quot;</span>
      subroutines. Additionally, the debugger now correctly handles proxy
      constant subroutines, and subroutine stubs.</li>
  <li><i>perlbug</i> now uses
      <span class="Li">%Module::CoreList::bug_tracker</span> to print out
      upstream bug tracker URLs. If a user identifies a particular module as the
      topic of their bug report and we're able to divine the URL for its
      upstream bug tracker, perlbug now provide a message to the user explaining
      that the core copies the CPAN version directly, and provide the URL for
      reporting the bug directly to the upstream author.
    <p class="Pp"><i>perlbug</i> no longer reports &quot;Message sent&quot; when
        it hasn't actually sent the message</p>
  </li>
  <li><i>perlthanks</i> is a new utility for sending non-bug-reports to the
      authors and maintainers of Perl. Getting nothing but bug reports can
      become a bit demoralising. If Perl 5.12 works well for you, please try out
      <i>perlthanks</i>. It will make the developers smile.</li>
  <li>Perl's developers have fixed bugs in <i>a2p</i> having to do with the
      <span class="Li">&quot;match()&quot;</span> operator in list context.
      Additionally, <i>a2p</i> no longer generates code that uses the
      <span class="Li">$[</span> variable.</li>

  Bug Fixes</a></h1>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>U+0FFFF is now a legal character in regular expressions.</li>
  <li>pp_qr now always returns a new regexp SV. Resolves RT #69852.
    <p class="Pp">Instead of returning a(nother) reference to the (pre-compiled)
        regexp in the optree, use <b>reg_temp_copy()</b> to create a copy of it,
        and return a reference to that. This resolves issues about
        Regexp::DESTROY not being called in a timely fashion (the original bug
        tracked by RT #69852), as well as bugs related to blessing regexps, and
        of assigning to regexps, as described in correspondence added to the
        ticket.</p>
    <p class="Pp">It transpires that we also need to undo the <b>SvPVX()</b>
        sharing when ithreads cloning a Regexp SV, because mother_re is set to
        NULL, instead of a cloned copy of the mother_re. This change might fix
        bugs with regexps and threads in certain other situations, but as yet
        neither tests nor bug reports have indicated any problems, so it might
        not actually be an edge case that it's possible to reach.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Several compilation errors and segfaults when perl was built with
      <span class="Li">&quot;-Dmad&quot;</span> were fixed.</li>
  <li>Fixes for lexer API changes in 5.11.2 which broke NYTProf's savesrc
      option.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;-t&quot;</span> should only return TRUE for file
      handles connected to a TTY
    <p class="Pp">The Microsoft C version of
        <span class="Li">&quot;isatty()&quot;</span> returns TRUE for all
        character mode devices, including the <i>/dev/null</i>-style
        &quot;nul&quot; device and printers like &quot;lpt1&quot;.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Fixed a regression caused by commit fafafbaf which caused a panic during
      parameter passing [perl #70171]</li>
  <li>On systems which in-place edits without backup files, -i'*' now works as
      the documentation says it does [perl #70802]</li>
  <li>Saving and restoring magic flags no longer loses readonly flag.</li>
  <li>The malformed syntax <span class="Li">&quot;grep EXPR LIST&quot;</span>
      (note the missing comma) no longer causes abrupt and total failure.</li>
  <li>Regular expressions compiled with <span class="Li">&quot;qr{}&quot;</span>
      literals properly set <span class="Li">&quot;$'&quot;</span> when matching
      again.</li>
  <li>Using named subroutines with <span class="Li">&quot;sort&quot;</span>
      should no longer lead to bus errors [perl #71076]</li>
  <li>Numerous bugfixes catch small issues caused by the recently-added Lexer
      API.</li>
  <li>Smart match against <span class="Li">@_</span> sometimes gave false
      negatives. [perl #71078]</li>
  <li><span class="Li">$@</span> may now be assigned a read-only value (without
      error or busting the stack).</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;sort&quot;</span> called recursively from within an
      active comparison subroutine no longer causes a bus error if run multiple
      times. [perl #71076]</li>
  <li>Tie::Hash::NamedCapture::* will not abort if passed bad input (RT
    #71828)</li>
  <li><span class="Li">@_</span> and <span class="Li">$_</span> no longer leak
      under threads (RT #34342 and #41138, also #70602, #70974)</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;-I&quot;</span> on shebang line now adds
      directories in front of <span class="Li">@INC</span> as documented, and as
      does <span class="Li">&quot;-I&quot;</span> when specified on the
      command-line.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;kill&quot;</span> is now fatal when called on
      non-numeric process identifiers. Previously, an
      <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> process identifier would be
      interpreted as a request to kill process 0, which would terminate the
      current process group on POSIX systems. Since process identifiers are
      always integers, killing a non-numeric process is now fatal.</li>
  <li>5.10.0 inadvertently disabled an optimisation, which caused a measurable
      performance drop in list assignment, such as is often used to assign
      function parameters from <span class="Li">@_</span>. The optimisation has
      been re-instated, and the performance regression fixed. (This fix is also
      present in 5.10.1)</li>
  <li>Fixed memory leak on <span class="Li">&quot;while (1) { map 1, 1
      }&quot;</span> [RT #53038].</li>
  <li>Some potential coredumps in PerlIO fixed [RT #57322,54828].</li>
  <li>The debugger now works with lvalue subroutines.</li>
  <li>The debugger's <span class="Li">&quot;m&quot;</span> command was broken on
      modules that defined constants [RT #61222].</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;crypt&quot;</span> and string complement could
      return tainted values for untainted arguments [RT #59998].</li>
  <li>The <span class="Li">&quot;-i&quot;</span><i>.suffix</i> command-line
      switch now recreates the file using restricted permissions, before
      changing its mode to match the original file. This eliminates a potential
      race condition [RT #60904].</li>
  <li>On some Unix systems, the value in <span class="Li">$?</span> would not
      have the top bit set (<span class="Li">&quot;$? &amp; 128&quot;</span>)
      even if the child core dumped.</li>
  <li>Under some circumstances, <span class="Li">$^R</span> could incorrectly
      become undefined [RT #57042].</li>
  <li>In the XS API, various hash functions, when passed a pre-computed hash
      where the key is UTF-8, might result in an incorrect lookup.</li>
  <li>XS code including <i>XSUB.h</i> before <i>perl.h</i> gave a compile-time
      error [RT #57176].</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;$object-&gt;isa('Foo')&quot;</span> would report
      false if the package <span class="Li">&quot;Foo&quot;</span> didn't exist,
      even if the object's <span class="Li">@ISA</span> contained
      <span class="Li">&quot;Foo&quot;</span>.</li>
  <li>Various bugs in the new-to 5.10.0 mro code, triggered by manipulating
      <span class="Li">@ISA</span>, have been found and fixed.</li>
  <li>Bitwise operations on references could crash the interpreter, e.g.
      <span class="Li">&quot;$x=\$y; $x |= &quot;foo&quot;&quot;</span> [RT
      #54956].</li>
  <li>Patterns including alternation might be sensitive to the internal UTF-8
      representation, e.g.
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    my $byte = chr(192);
    my $utf8 = chr(192); utf8::upgrade($utf8);
    $utf8 =~ /$byte|X}/i;       # failed in 5.10.0
    </pre>
  </li>
  <li>Within UTF8-encoded Perl source files (i.e. where
      <span class="Li">&quot;use utf8&quot;</span> is in effect), double-quoted
      literal strings could be corrupted where a
      <span class="Li">&quot;\xNN&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;\0NNN&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;\N{}&quot;</span> is followed by a literal
      character with ordinal value greater than 255 [RT #59908].</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;B::Deparse&quot;</span> failed to correctly deparse
      various constructs: <span class="Li">&quot;readpipe STRING&quot;</span>
      [RT #62428], <span class="Li">&quot;CORE::require(STRING)&quot;</span> [RT
      #62488], <span class="Li">&quot;sub foo(_)&quot;</span> [RT #62484].</li>
  <li>Using <span class="Li">&quot;setpgrp&quot;</span> with no arguments could
      corrupt the perl stack.</li>
  <li>The block form of <span class="Li">&quot;eval&quot;</span> is now
      specifically trappable by <span class="Li">&quot;Safe&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;ops&quot;</span>. Previously it was erroneously
      treated like string <span class="Li">&quot;eval&quot;</span>.</li>
  <li>In 5.10.0, the two characters <span class="Li">&quot;[~&quot;</span> were
      sometimes parsed as the smart match operator
      (<span class="Li">&quot;~~&quot;</span>) [RT #63854].</li>
  <li>In 5.10.0, the <span class="Li">&quot;*&quot;</span> quantifier in
      patterns was sometimes treated as
      <span class="Li">&quot;{0,32767}&quot;</span> [RT #60034, #60464]. For
      example, this match would fail:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    (&quot;ab&quot; x 32768) =~ /^(ab)*$/
    </pre>
  </li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;shmget&quot;</span> was limited to a 32 bit segment
      size on a 64 bit OS [RT #63924].</li>
  <li>Using <span class="Li">&quot;next&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;last&quot;</span> to exit a
      <span class="Li">&quot;given&quot;</span> block no longer produces a
      spurious warning like the following:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    Exiting given via last at foo.pl line 123
    </pre>
  </li>
  <li>Assigning a format to a glob could corrupt the format; e.g.:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>     *bar=*foo{FORMAT}; # foo format now bad
    </pre>
  </li>
  <li>Attempting to coerce a typeglob to a string or number could cause an
      assertion failure. The correct error message is now generated,
      <span class="Li">&quot;Can't coerce GLOB to
      </span><span class="Li"><i>$type</i></span><span class="Li">&quot;</span>.</li>
  <li>Under <span class="Li">&quot;use filetest 'access'&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;-x&quot;</span> was using the wrong access mode.
      This has been fixed [RT #49003].</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;length&quot;</span> on a tied scalar that returned
      a Unicode value would not be correct the first time. This has been
    fixed.</li>
  <li>Using an array <span class="Li">&quot;tie&quot;</span> inside in array
      <span class="Li">&quot;tie&quot;</span> could SEGV. This has been fixed.
      [RT #51636]</li>
  <li>A race condition inside
      <span class="Li">&quot;PerlIOStdio_close()&quot;</span> has been
      identified and fixed. This used to cause various threading issues,
      including SEGVs.</li>
  <li>In <span class="Li">&quot;unpack&quot;</span>, the use of
      <span class="Li">&quot;()&quot;</span> groups in scalar context was
      internally placing a list on the interpreter's stack, which manifested in
      various ways, including SEGVs. This is now fixed [RT #50256].</li>
  <li>Magic was called twice in <span class="Li">&quot;substr&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;\&amp;$x&quot;</span>, <span class="Li">&quot;tie
      $x, $m&quot;</span> and <span class="Li">&quot;chop&quot;</span>. These
      have all been fixed.</li>
  <li>A 5.10.0 optimisation to clear the temporary stack within the implicit
      loop of <span class="Li">&quot;s///ge&quot;</span> has been reverted, as
      it turned out to be the cause of obscure bugs in seemingly unrelated parts
      of the interpreter [commit ef0d4e17921ee3de].</li>
  <li>The line numbers for warnings inside
      <span class="Li">&quot;elsif&quot;</span> are now correct.</li>
  <li>The <span class="Li">&quot;..&quot;</span> operator now works correctly
      with ranges whose ends are at or close to the values of the smallest and
      largest integers.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;binmode STDIN, ':raw'&quot;</span> could lead to
      segmentation faults on some platforms. This has been fixed [RT
    #54828].</li>
  <li>An off-by-one error meant that <span class="Li">&quot;index $str,
      ...&quot;</span> was effectively being executed as
      <span class="Li">&quot;index &quot;$str\0&quot;, ...&quot;</span>. This
      has been fixed [RT #53746].</li>
  <li>Various leaks associated with named captures in regexes have been fixed
      [RT #57024].</li>
  <li>A weak reference to a hash would leak. This was affecting
      <span class="Li">&quot;DBI&quot;</span> [RT #56908].</li>
  <li>Using (?|) in a regex could cause a segfault [RT #59734].</li>
  <li>Use of a UTF-8 <span class="Li">&quot;tr//&quot;</span> within a closure
      could cause a segfault [RT #61520].</li>
  <li>Calling <span class="Li">&quot;Perl_sv_chop()&quot;</span> or otherwise
      upgrading an SV could result in an unaligned 64-bit access on the SPARC
      architecture [RT #60574].</li>
  <li>In the 5.10.0 release,
      <span class="Li">&quot;inc_version_list&quot;</span> would incorrectly
      list <span class="Li">&quot;5.10.*&quot;</span> after
      <span class="Li">&quot;5.8.*&quot;</span>; this affected the
      <span class="Li">@INC</span> search order [RT #67628].</li>
  <li>In 5.10.0, <span class="Li">&quot;pack &quot;a*&quot;,
      $tainted_value&quot;</span> returned a non-tainted value [RT #52552].</li>
  <li>In 5.10.0, <span class="Li">&quot;printf&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;sprintf&quot;</span> could produce the fatal error
      <span class="Li">&quot;panic: utf8_mg_pos_cache_update&quot;</span> when
      printing UTF-8 strings [RT #62666].</li>
  <li>In the 5.10.0 release, a dynamically created
      <span class="Li">&quot;AUTOLOAD&quot;</span> method might be missed
      (method cache issue) [RT #60220,60232].</li>
  <li>In the 5.10.0 release, a combination of <span class="Li">&quot;use
      feature&quot;</span> and <span class="Li">&quot;//ee&quot;</span> could
      cause a memory leak [RT #63110].</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;-C&quot;</span> on the shebang
      (<span class="Li">&quot;#!&quot;</span>) line is once more permitted if it
      is also specified on the command line.
      <span class="Li">&quot;-C&quot;</span> on the shebang line used to be a
      silent no-op <i>if</i> it was not also on the command line, so perl 5.10.0
      disallowed it, which broke some scripts. Now perl checks whether it is
      also on the command line and only dies if it is not [RT #67880].</li>
  <li>In 5.10.0, certain types of re-entrant regular expression could crash, or
      cause the following assertion failure [RT #60508]:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    Assertion rx-&gt;sublen &gt;= (s - rx-&gt;subbeg) + i failed
    </pre>

  <li>Perl now includes previously missing files from the Unicode Character

    announce that Perl 5.12 includes support for several new platforms. At the

  <li>Perl 5.12 supports Windows 2000 and later. The supporting code for legacy
      versions of Windows is still included, but will be removed during the next
      development cycle.</li>
  <li>Initial support for building Perl with MinGW-w64 is now available.</li>
  <li><i>perl.exe</i> now includes a manifest resource to specify the
      <span class="Li">&quot;trustInfo&quot;</span> settings for Windows Vista
      and later. Without this setting Windows would treat <i>perl.exe</i> as a
      legacy application and apply various heuristics like redirecting access to
      protected file system areas (like the &quot;Program Files&quot; folder) to
      the users &quot;VirtualStore&quot; instead of generating a proper
      &quot;permission denied&quot; error.
    <p class="Pp">The manifest resource also requests the Microsoft
        Common-Controls version 6.0 (themed controls introduced in Windows XP).
        Check out the Win32::VisualStyles module on CPAN to switch back to old
        style unthemed controls for legacy applications.</p>
  </li>
  <li>The <span class="Li">&quot;-t&quot;</span> filetest operator now only
      returns true if the filehandle is connected to a console window. In
      previous versions of Perl it would return true for all character mode
      devices, including <i>NUL</i> and <i>LPT1</i>.</li>
  <li>The <span class="Li">&quot;-p&quot;</span> filetest operator now works
      correctly, and the Fcntl::S_IFIFO constant is defined when Perl is
      compiled with Microsoft Visual C. In previous Perl versions
      <span class="Li">&quot;-p&quot;</span> always returned a false value, and
      the Fcntl::S_IFIFO constant was not defined.
    <p class="Pp">This bug is specific to Microsoft Visual C and never affected
        Perl binaries built with MinGW.</p>
  </li>
  <li>The socket error codes are now more widely supported: The POSIX module
      will define the symbolic names, like POSIX::EWOULDBLOCK, and
      stringification of socket error codes in $! works as well now;
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>  C:\&gt;perl -MPOSIX -E &quot;$!=POSIX::EWOULDBLOCK; say $!&quot;
  A non-blocking socket operation could not be completed immediately.
    </pre>
  </li>
  <li><b>flock()</b> will now set sensible error codes in $!. Previous Perl
      versions copied the value of $^E into $!, which caused much
    confusion.</li>
  <li><b>select()</b> now supports all empty
      <span class="Li">&quot;fd_set&quot;</span>s more correctly.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">'.\foo'</span> and <span class="Li">'..\foo'</span> were
      treated differently than <span class="Li">'./foo'</span> and
      <span class="Li">'../foo'</span> by <span class="Li">&quot;do&quot;</span>
      and <span class="Li">&quot;require&quot;</span> [RT #63492].</li>
  <li>Improved message window handling means that
      <span class="Li">&quot;alarm&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;kill&quot;</span> messages will no longer be
      dropped under race conditions.</li>
  <li>Various bits of Perl's build infrastructure are no longer converted to
      win32 line endings at release time. If this hurts you, please report the
      problem with the perlbug program included with perl.</li>

  Problems</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">This is a list of some significant unfixed bugs, which are
    regressions from either 5.10.x or 5.8.x.</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Some CPANPLUS tests may fail if there is a functioning file
      <i>../../cpanp-run-perl</i> outside your build directory. The failure
      shouldn't imply there's a problem with the actual functional software. The
      bug is already fixed in [RT #74188] and is scheduled for inclusion in
      perl-v5.12.1.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;List::Util::first&quot;</span> misbehaves in the
      presence of a lexical <span class="Li">$_</span> (typically introduced by
      <span class="Li">&quot;my $_&quot;</span> or implicitly by
      <span class="Li">&quot;given&quot;</span>). The variable which gets set
      for each iteration is the package variable <span class="Li">$_</span>, not
      the lexical <span class="Li">$_</span> [RT #67694].
    <p class="Pp">A similar issue may occur in other modules that provide
        functions which take a block as their first argument, like</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    foo { ... $_ ...} list
    </pre>
  </li>
  <li>Some regexes may run much more slowly when run in a child thread compared
      with the thread the pattern was compiled into [RT #55600].</li>
  <li>Things like <span class="Li">&quot;&quot;\N{LATIN SMALL LIGATURE FF}&quot;
      =~ /\N{LATIN SMALL LETTER F}+/&quot;</span> will appear to hang as they
      get into a very long running loop [RT #72998].</li>
  <li>Several porters have reported mysterious crashes when Perl's entire test
      suite is run after a build on certain Windows 2000 systems. When run by
      hand, the individual tests reportedly work fine.</li>

<p class="Pp">This is woefully incomplete as it's automatically generated from
    version control history. In particular, it doesn't include the names of the
    (very much appreciated) contributors who reported issues in previous
    versions of Perl that helped make Perl 5.12.0 better. For a more complete

<p class="Pp">Our &quot;retired&quot; pumpkings Nicholas Clark and Rafael

    first by a long shot in committing patches authored by others, pushing 44%
    of the commits since 5.10.0 in this category, often after providing
    considerable coaching to the patch authors. These statistics in no way
    comprise all of their contributions, but express in shorthand that we
    couldn't have done it without them.</p>
