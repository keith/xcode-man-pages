<p class="Pp">This document describes differences between the 5.30.2 release and

<p class="Pp">If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.30.1, first
    read perl5302delta, which describes differences between 5.30.1 and

<h2 class="Ss">[CVE-2020-10543] Buffer overflow caused by a crafted regular
  expression</h2>
<p class="Pp">A signed <span class="Li">&quot;size_t&quot;</span> integer
    overflow in the storage space calculations for nested regular expression
    quantifiers could cause a heap buffer overflow in Perl's regular expression
    compiler that overwrites memory allocated after the regular expression
    storage space with attacker supplied data.</p>
<p class="Pp">The target system needs a sufficient amount of memory to allocate
    partial expansions of the nested quantifiers prior to the overflow
    occurring. This requirement is unlikely to be met on 64-bit systems.</p>

    Vingroup).</p>

<h2 class="Ss">[CVE-2020-10878] Integer overflow via malformed bytecode produced
  by a crafted regular expression</h2>
<p class="Pp">Integer overflows in the calculation of offsets between
    instructions for the regular expression engine could cause corruption of the
    intermediate language state of a compiled regular expression. An attacker
    could abuse this behaviour to insert instructions into the compiled form of
    a Perl regular expression.</p>

<p class="Pp">Recursive calls to

<h2 class="Ss" id="Additional_Note"><a class="permalink" href="#Additional_Note">Additional
  Note</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">An application written in Perl would only be vulnerable to any of
    the above flaws if it evaluates regular expressions supplied by the
    attacker. Evaluating regular expressions in this fashion is known to be
    dangerous since the regular expression engine does not protect against
    denial of service attacks in this usage scenario.</p>

<p class="Pp">Perl 5.30.3 represents approximately 3 months of development since
    Perl 5.30.2 and contains approximately 1,100 lines of changes across 42
    files from 7 authors.</p>
<p class="Pp">Excluding auto-generated files, documentation and release tools,
    there were approximately 350 lines of changes to 8 .pm, .t, .c and .h
  files.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl continues to flourish into its fourth decade thanks to a
    vibrant community of users and developers. The following people are known to
    have contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.30.3:</p>
<p class="Pp">Chris 'BinGOs' Williams, Hugo van der Sanden, John Lightsey, Karl
    Williamson, Nicolas R., Sawyer X, Steve Hay.</p>
<p class="Pp">The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is
    automatically generated from version control history. In particular, it does
    not include the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who
    reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.</p>
<p class="Pp">Many of the changes included in this version originated in the
    CPAN modules included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire CPAN
    community for helping Perl to flourish.</p>
