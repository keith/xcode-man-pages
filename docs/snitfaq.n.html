   The definitions below are for supplemental macros used in Tcl/Tk
   manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.

  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget.  The
  	options follow on successive lines, in four columns separated
  	by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.

  IS THIS DOCUMENT?</a></h2>
This is an atypical FAQ list, in that few of the questions are frequently asked.
  Rather, these are the questions I think a newcomer to Snit should be asking.
  This file is not a complete reference to Snit, however; that information is in
  the <b>snit</b> man page.

<h2 class="Ss" id="WHAT_IS_SNIT?"><a class="permalink" href="#WHAT_IS_SNIT?">WHAT
  IS SNIT?</a></h2>
Snit is a framework for defining abstract data types and megawidgets in pure
  Tcl. The name &quot;Snit&quot; stands for &quot;Snit's Not Incr Tcl&quot;,
  signifying that Snit takes a different approach to defining objects than does
  Incr Tcl, the best known object framework for Tcl. Had I realized that Snit
  would become at all popular, I'd probably have chosen something else.
<p class="Pp">The primary purpose of Snit is to be <i>object glue</i>--to help
    you compose diverse objects from diverse sources into types and megawidgets
    with clean, convenient interfaces so that you can more easily build your
    application.</p>
<p class="Pp">Snit isn't about theoretical purity or minimalist design; it's
    about being able to do powerful things easily and consistently without
    having to think about them--so that you can concentrate on building your
    application.</p>
<p class="Pp">Snit isn't about implementing thousands of nearly identical
    carefully-specified lightweight thingamajigs--not as individual Snit
    objects. Traditional Tcl methods will be much faster, and not much more
    complicated. But Snit <i>is</i> about implementing a clean interface to
    manage a collection of thousands of nearly identical carefully-specified
    lightweight thingamajigs (e.g., think of the text widget and text tags, or
    the canvas widget and canvas objects). Snit lets you hide the details of
    just how those thingamajigs are stored--so that you can ignore it, and
    concentrate on building your application.</p>
<p class="Pp">Snit isn't a way of life, a silver bullet, or the Fountain of
    Youth. It's just a way of managing complexity--and of managing some of the
    complexity of managing complexity--so that you can concentrate on building
    your application.</p>

<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>A Snit object should be at least as efficient as a hand-coded Tcl object
      (see <i>http://www.wjduquette.com/tcl/objects.html</i>).</li>
  <li>The fact that Snit was used in an object's implementation should be
      transparent (and irrelevant) to clients of that object.</li>
  <li>Snit should be able to encapsulate objects from other sources,
      particularly Tk widgets.</li>
  <li>Snit megawidgets should be (to the extent possible) indistinguishable in
      interface from Tk widgets.</li>
  <li>Snit should be Tclish--that is, rather than trying to emulate C++,
      Smalltalk, or anything else, it should try to emulate Tcl itself.</li>
  <li>It should have a simple, easy-to-use, easy-to-remember syntax.</li>

Snit is unique among Tcl object systems in that it is based not on inheritance
  but on delegation. Object systems based on inheritance only allow you to
  inherit from classes defined using the same system, and that's a shame. In
  Tcl, an object is anything that acts like an object; it shouldn't matter how
  the object was implemented. I designed Snit to help me build applications out
  of the materials at hand; thus, Snit is designed to be able to incorporate and
  build on any object, whether it's a hand-coded object, a Tk widget, an Incr
  Tcl object, a BWidget or almost anything else.
<p class="Pp">Note that you can achieve the effect of inheritance using
    <b>COMPONENTS</b> and <b>DELEGATION</b>--and you can inherit from anything
    that looks like a Tcl object.</p>

  <li>Define constructors, destructors, instance methods, type methods,

  <li>Assemble a type out of component types. Instance methods and options can
      be delegated to the component types automatically.</li>

The current Snit distribution includes two versions, Snit 1.3 and Snit 2.2. The
  reason that both are included is that Snit 2.2 takes advantage of a number of
  new features of Tcl 8.5 to improve run-time efficiency; as a side-effect, the
  ugliness of Snit's error messages and stack traces has been reduced
  considerably. The cost of using Snit 2.2, of course, is that you must target
  Tcl 8.5.
<p class="Pp">Snit 1.3, on the other hand, lacks Snit 2.2's optimizations, but
    requires only Tcl 8.3 and later.</p>
<p class="Pp">In short, if you're targetting Tcl 8.3 or 8.4 you should use Snit
    1.3. If you can afford to target Tcl 8.5, you should definitely use Snit
    2.2. If you will be targetting both, you can use Snit 1.3 exclusively, or
    (if your code is unaffected by the minor incompatibilities between the two
    versions) you can use Snit 1.3 for Tcl 8.4 and Snit 2.2 for Tcl 8.5.</p>

  DO I SELECT THE VERSION OF SNIT I WANT TO USE?</a></h2>
To always use Snit 1.3 (or a later version of Snit 1.x), invoke Snit as follows:
<pre>
package require snit 1.3
</pre>
To always use Snit 2.2 (or a later version of Snit 2.x), say this instead:
<pre>
package require snit 2.2
</pre>
Note that if you request Snit 2.2 explicitly, your application will halt with
  Tcl 8.4, since Snit 2.2 is unavailable for Tcl 8.4.
<p class="Pp">If you wish your application to always use the latest available
    version of Snit, don't specify a version number:</p>
<pre>
package require snit
</pre>
Tcl will find and load the latest version that's available relative to the
  version of Tcl being used. In this case, be careful to avoid using any
  incompatible features.

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="HOW_ARE_SNIT_1.3_AND_SNIT_2.2_INCOMPATIBLE?"><a class="permalink" href="#HOW_ARE_SNIT_1.3_AND_SNIT_2.2_INCOMPATIBLE?">HOW
  ARE SNIT 1.3 AND SNIT 2.2 INCOMPATIBLE?</a></h2>
To the extent possible, Snit 2.2 is intended to be a drop-in replacement for
  Snit 1.3. Unfortunately, some incompatibilities were inevitable because Snit
  2.2 uses Tcl 8.5's new <b>namespace ensemble</b> mechanism to implement
  subcommand dispatch. This approach is much faster than the mechanism used in
  Snit 1.3, and also results in much better error messages; however, it also
  places new constraints on the implementation.
<p class="Pp">There are four specific incompatibilities between Snit 1.3 and
    Snit 2.2.</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Snit 1.3 supports implicit naming of objects. Suppose you define a new
      <b>snit::type</b> called <b>dog</b>. You can create instances of
      <b>dog</b> in three ways:
    <pre>
dog spot               ;# Explicit naming
set obj1 [dog %AUTO%]  ;# Automatic naming
set obj2 [dog]         ;# Implicit naming
    </pre>
    In Snit 2.2, type commands are defined using the <b>namespace ensemble</b>
      mechanism; and <b>namespace ensemble</b> doesn't allow an ensemble command
      to be called without a subcommand. In short, using <b>namespace
      ensemble</b> there's no way to support implicit naming.
    <p class="Pp">All is not lost, however. If the type has no type methods,
        then the type command is a simple command rather than an ensemble, and
        <b>namespace ensemble</b> is not used. In this case, implicit naming is
        still possible.</p>
    <p class="Pp">In short, you can have implicit naming if you're willing to do
        without type methods (including the standard type methods, like <b>$type
        info</b>). To do so, use the <b>-hastypemethods</b> pragma:</p>
    <pre>
pragma -hastypemethods 0
    </pre>
  </li>
  <li>Hierarchical methods and type methods are implemented differently in Snit
      2.2.
    <p class="Pp">A hierarchical method is an instance method which has
        subcommands; these subcommands are themselves methods. The Tk text
        widget's <b>tag</b> command and its subcommands are examples of
        hierarchical methods. You can implement such subcommands in Snit simply
        by including multiple words in the method names:</p>
    <pre>
method {tag configure} {tag args} { ... }
method {tag cget} {tag option} {...}
    </pre>
    Here we've implicitly defined a <b>tag</b> method which has two subcommands,
      <b>configure</b> and <b>cget</b>.
    <p class="Pp">In Snit 1.3, hierarchical methods could be called in two
      ways:</p>
    <pre>
$obj tag cget -myoption      ;# The good way
$obj {tag cget} -myoption    ;# The weird way
    </pre>
    In the second call, we see that a hierarchical method or type method is
      simply one whose name contains multiple words.
    <p class="Pp">In Snit 2.2 this is no longer the case, and the
        &quot;weird&quot; way of calling hierarchical methods and type methods
        no longer works.</p>
  </li>
  <li>The third incompatibility derives from the second. In Snit 1.3,
      hierarchical methods were also simply methods whose name contains multiple
      words. As a result, <b>$obj info methods</b> returned the full names of
      all hierarchical methods. In the example above, the list returned by
      <b>$obj info methods</b> would include <b>tag configure</b> and <b>tag
      cget</b> but not <b>tag</b>, since <b>tag</b> is defined only implicitly.
    <p class="Pp">In Snit 2.2, hierarchical methods and type methods are no
        longer simply ones whose name contains multiple words; in the above
        example, the list returned by <b>$obj info methods</b> would include
        <b>tag</b> but not <b>tag configure</b> or <b>tag cget</b>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>The fourth incompatibility is due to a new feature. Snit 2.2 uses the new
      <b>namespace path</b> command so that a type's code can call any command
      defined in the type's parent namespace without qualification or
      importation. For example, suppose you have a package called
      <b>mypackage</b> which defines a number of commands including a type,
      <b>::mypackage::mytype</b>. Thanks to <b>namespace path</b>, the type's
      code can call any of the other commands defined in <b>::mypackage::</b>.
    <p class="Pp">This is extremely convenient. However, it also means that
        commands defined in the parent namespace, <b>::mypackage::</b> can block
        the type's access to identically named commands in the global namespace.
        This can lead to bugs. For example, Tcllib includes a type called
        <b>::tie::std::file</b>. This type's code calls the standard <b>file</b>
        command. When run with Snit 2.2, the code broke-- the type's command,
        <b>::tie::std::file</b>, is itself a command in the type's parent
        namespace, and so instead of calling the standard <b>file</b> command,
        the type found itself calling itself.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

  THERE OTHER DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SNIT 1.X AND SNIT 2.2?</a></h2>
Yes.
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Method dispatch is considerably faster.</li>
  <li>Many error messages and stack traces are cleaner.</li>
  <li>The <b>-simpledispatch</b> pragma is obsolete, and ignored if present. In
      Snit 1.x, <b>-simpledispatch</b> substitutes a faster mechanism for method
      dispatch, at the cost of losing certain features. Snit 2.2 method dispatch
      is faster still in all cases, so <b>-simpledispatch</b> is no longer
      needed.</li>
  <li>In Snit 2.2, a type's code (methods, type methods, etc.) can call commands
      from the type's parent namespace without qualifying or importing them,
      i.e., type <b>::parentns::mytype</b>'s code can call
      <b>::parentns::someproc</b> as just <b>someproc</b>.
    <p class="Pp">This is extremely useful when a type is defined as part of a
        larger package, and shares a parent namespace with the rest of the
        package; it means that the type can call other commands defined by the
        package without any extra work.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This feature depends on the new Tcl 8.5 <b>namespace path</b>
        command, which is why it hasn't been implemented for V1.x. V1.x code can
        achieve something similar by placing</p>
    <pre>
namespace import [namespace parent]::*
    </pre>
    in a type constructor. This is less useful, however, as it picks up only
      those commands which have already been exported by the parent namespace at
      the time the type is defined.</li>

<h2 class="Ss" id="WHAT_IS_AN_OBJECT?"><a class="permalink" href="#WHAT_IS_AN_OBJECT?">WHAT
  IS AN OBJECT?</a></h2>
A full description of object-oriented programming is beyond the scope of this
  FAQ, obviously. In simple terms, an object is an instance of an abstract data
  type--a coherent bundle of code and data. There are many ways to represent
  objects in Tcl/Tk; the best known examples are the Tk widgets.
<p class="Pp">A Tk widget is an object; it is represented by a Tcl command. The
    object's methods are subcommands of the Tcl command. The object's properties
    are options accessed using the <b>configure</b> and <b>cget</b> methods.
    Snit uses the same conventions as Tk widgets do.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="WHAT_IS_AN_ABSTRACT_DATA_TYPE?"><a class="permalink" href="#WHAT_IS_AN_ABSTRACT_DATA_TYPE?">WHAT
  IS AN ABSTRACT DATA TYPE?</a></h2>
In computer science terms, an abstract data type is a complex data structure
  along with a set of operations--a stack, a queue, a binary tree, etc--that is
  to say, in modern terms, an object. In systems that include some form of
  inheritance the word <i>class</i> is usually used instead of <i>abstract data
  type</i>, but as Snit doesn't implement inheritance as it's ordinarily
  understood the older term seems more appropriate. Sometimes this is called
  <i>object-based</i> programming as opposed to object-oriented programming.
  Note that you can easily create the effect of inheritance using
  <b>COMPONENTS</b> and <b>DELEGATION</b>.
<p class="Pp">In Snit, as in Tk, a <i>type</i> is a command that creates
    instances -- objects -- which belong to the type. Most types define some
    number of <i>options</i> which can be set at creation time, and usually can
    be changed later.</p>
<p class="Pp">Further, an <i>instance</i> is also a Tcl command--a command that
    gives access to the operations which are defined for that abstract data
    type. Conventionally, the operations are defined as subcommands of the
    instance command. For example, to insert text into a Tk text widget, you use
    the text widget's <b>insert</b> subcommand:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    # Create a text widget and insert some text in it.
    text .mytext -width 80 -height 24
    .mytext insert end &quot;Howdy!&quot;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">In this example, <b>text</b> is the <i>type</i> command and
    <b>.mytext</b> is the <i>instance</i> command.</p>
<p class="Pp">In Snit, object subcommands are generally called <b>INSTANCE
    METHODS</b>.</p>

A <b>snit::type</b> is a non-GUI abstract data type, e.g., a stack or a queue.
  <b>snit::type</b>s are defined using the <b>snit::type</b> command. For
  example, if you were designing a kennel management system for a dog breeder,
  you'd need a dog type.
<p class="Pp"></p>

% snit::type dog {
    # ...
}
::dog
%
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This definition defines a new command (<b>::dog</b>, in this case)
    that can be used to define dog objects.</p>
<p class="Pp">An instance of a <b>snit::type</b> can have <b>INSTANCE

A <b>snit::widgetadaptor</b> uses Snit to wrap an existing widget type (e.g., a

  DO I CREATE AN INSTANCE OF A SNIT::TYPE?</a></h2>
You create an instance of a <b>snit::type</b> by passing the new instance's name
  to the type's create method. In the following example, we create a <b>dog</b>
  object called <b>spot</b>.
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
% snit::type dog {
    # ....
}
::dog
% dog create spot
::spot
%
</pre>
<p class="Pp">In general, the <b>create</b> method name can be omitted so long
    as the instance name doesn't conflict with any defined <b>TYPE METHODS</b>.
    (See <b>TYPE COMPONENTS</b> for the special case in which this doesn't
    work.) So the following example is identical to the previous example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
% snit::type dog {
    # ....
}
::dog
% dog spot
::spot
%
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This document generally uses the shorter form.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the <b>dog</b> type defines <b>OPTIONS</b>, these can usually
    be given defaults at creation time:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
% snit::type dog {
    option -breed mongrel
    option -color brown
    method bark {} { return &quot;$self barks.&quot; }
}
::dog
% dog create spot -breed dalmation -color spotted
::spot
% spot cget -breed
dalmation
% spot cget -color
spotted
%
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Once created, the instance name now names a new Tcl command that
    is used to manipulate the object. For example, the following code makes the
    dog bark:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
% spot bark
::spot barks.
%

Some programmers prefer to save the object name in a variable, and reference it
  that way. For example,
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
% snit::type dog { ... }
::dog
% set d [dog spot -breed dalmation -color spotted]
::spot
% $d cget -breed
dalmation

If you'd like Snit to generate an object name for you, use the <b>%AUTO%</b>
  keyword as the requested name:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
% snit::type dog { ... }
::dog
% set d [dog %AUTO%]

::dog2 barks.

<p class="Pp">The <b>%AUTO%</b> keyword can be embedded in a longer string:</p>

Tcl's <b>rename</b> command renames other commands. It's a common technique in
  Tcl to modify an existing command by renaming it and defining a new command

Tcl's <b>rename</b> command renames other commands. It's a common technique in
  Tcl to modify an existing command by renaming it and defining a new command
  with the original name; the new command usually calls the renamed command.
<p class="Pp">All Snit objects (including <i>widgets</i> and
    <i>widgetadaptors</i>) can be renamed, though this flexibility has some
    consequences:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>In an instance method, the implicit argument <b>self</b> will always
      contain the object's current name, so instance methods can always call
      other instance methods using <b>$self</b>.</li>
  <li>If the object is renamed, however, then <b>$self</b>'s value will change.
      Therefore, don't use <b>$self</b> for anything that will break if
      <b>$self</b> changes. For example, don't pass a callback command to
      another object like this:
    <pre>
    .btn configure -command [list $self ButtonPress]
    </pre>
    You'll get an error if <b>.btn</b> calls your command after your object is
      renamed.</li>
  <li>Instead, your object should define its callback command like this:
    <pre>
    .btn configure -command [mymethod ButtonPress]
    </pre>
    The <b>mymethod</b> command returns code that will call the desired method
      safely; the caller of the callback can add additional arguments to the end
      of the command as usual.</li>
  <li>Every object has a private namespace; the name of this namespace is
      available in method bodies, etc., as the value of the implicit argument
      <b>selfns</b>. This value is constant for the life of the object. Use
      <b>$selfns</b> instead of <b>$self</b> if you need a unique token to
      identify the object.</li>
  <li>When a <b>snit::widget</b>'s instance command is renamed, its Tk window
      name remains the same -- and is still extremely important. Consequently,
      the Tk window name is available in method bodies as the value of the
      implicit argument <b>win</b>. This value is constant for the life of the
      object. When creating child windows, it's best to use <b>$win.child</b>
      rather than <b>$self.child</b> as the name of the child window.</li>

Any Snit object of any type can be destroyed by renaming it to the empty string
  using the Tcl <b>rename</b> command.
<p class="Pp">Snit megawidgets (i.e., instances of <b>snit::widget</b> and

An instance method is a procedure associated with a specific object and called

Instance methods are defined in the type definition using the <b>method</b>
  statement. Consider the following code that might be used to add dogs to a
  computer simulation:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
% snit::type dog {
    method bark {} {
        return &quot;$self barks.&quot;
    }
    method chase {thing} {
        return &quot;$self chases $thing.&quot;
    }
}
::dog
%
</pre>
<p class="Pp">A dog can bark, and it can chase things.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>method</b> statement looks just like a normal Tcl
    <b>proc</b>, except that it appears in a <b>snit::type</b> definition.
    Notice that every instance method gets an implicit argument called
    <b>self</b>; this argument contains the object's name. (There's more on
    implicit method arguments below.)</p>

  DOES A CLIENT CALL AN INSTANCE METHOD?</a></h2>
The method name becomes a subcommand of the object. For example, let's put a
  simulated dog through its paces:
<p class="Pp"></p>

% dog spot

::spot barks.

If method A needs to call method B on the same object, it does so just as a
  client does: it calls method B as a subcommand of the object itself, using the
  object name stored in the implicit argument <b>self</b>.
<p class="Pp">Suppose, for example, that our dogs never chase anything without
    barking at them:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>

    method bark {} {
        return &quot;$self barks.&quot;

Not really, so long as you avoid the standard instance method names:

<h2 class="Ss" id="WHAT_IS_A_HIERARCHICAL_METHOD?"><a class="permalink" href="#WHAT_IS_A_HIERARCHICAL_METHOD?">WHAT
  IS A HIERARCHICAL METHOD?</a></h2>
An object's methods are subcommands of the object's instance command.
  Hierarchical methods allow an object's methods to have subcommands of their
  own; and these can in turn have subcommands, and so on. This allows the
  programmer to define a tree-shaped command structure, such as is used by many
  of the Tk widgets--the subcommands of the Tk <b>text</b> widget's <b>tag</b>
  method are hierarchical methods.

Define methods whose names consist of multiple words. These words define the
  hierarchy implicitly. For example, the following code defines a <b>tag</b>
  method with subcommands <b>cget</b> and <b>configure</b>:
<pre>
snit::widget mytext {
    method {tag configure} {tag args} { ... }
    method {tag cget} {tag option} {...}
}
</pre>
Note that there is no explicit definition for the <b>tag</b> method; it is
  implicit in the definition of <b>tag configure</b> and <b>tag cget</b>. If you
  tried to define <b>tag</b> explicitly in this example, you'd get an error.

It's often useful to define private methods, that is, instance methods intended
  to be called only by other methods of the same object.
<p class="Pp">Snit doesn't implement any access control on instance methods, so
    all methods are <i>de facto</i> public. Conventionally, though, the names of
    public methods begin with a lower-case letter, and the names of private
    methods begin with an upper-case letter.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, suppose our simulated dogs only bark in response to
    other stimuli; they never bark just for fun. So the <b>bark</b> method
    becomes <b>Bark</b> to indicate that it is private:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
% snit::type dog {
    # Private by convention: begins with uppercase letter.
    method Bark {} {
        return &quot;$self barks.&quot;
    }
    method chase {thing} {
        return &quot;$self chases $thing. [$self Bark]&quot;

Method argument lists are defined just like normal Tcl <b>proc</b> argument
  lists; in particular, they can include arguments with default values and the
  <b>args</b> argument.
<p class="Pp">However, every method also has a number of implicit arguments
    provided by Snit in addition to those explicitly defined. The names of these

The implicit argument <b>self</b> contains the object's fully qualified name.
<p class="Pp">If the object's command is renamed, then <b>$self</b> will change
    to match in subsequent calls. Thus, your code should not assume that
    <b>$self</b> is constant unless you know for sure that the object will never
    be renamed.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
% snit::type thing {
    method myself {} {
        return $self

<h2 class="Ss" id="WHAT_IS_$SELFNS?"><a class="permalink" href="#WHAT_IS_$SELFNS?">WHAT

Each Snit object has a private namespace in which to store its <b>INSTANCE
  VARIABLES</b> and <b>OPTIONS</b>. The implicit argument <b>selfns</b> contains
  the name of this namespace; its value never changes, and is constant for the
  life of the object, even if the object's name changes:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
% snit::type thing {

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="WHAT_IS_$WIN?"><a class="permalink" href="#WHAT_IS_$WIN?">WHAT

The implicit argument <b>win</b> is defined for all Snit methods, though it
  really makes sense only for those of <b>WIDGETS</b> and <b>WIDGET
  ADAPTORS</b>. <b>$win</b> is simply the original name of the object, whether
  it's been renamed or not. For widgets and widgetadaptors, it is also therefore
  the name of a Tk window.
<p class="Pp">When a <b>snit::widgetadaptor</b> is used to modify the interface
    of a widget or megawidget, it must rename the widget's original command and
    replace it with its own.</p>
<p class="Pp">Thus, using <b>win</b> whenever the Tk window name is called for
    means that a <b>snit::widget</b> or <b>snit::widgetadaptor</b> can be

It depends on the context.
<p class="Pp">Suppose in my application I have a <b>dog</b> object named
    <b>fido</b>, and I want <b>fido</b> to bark when a Tk button called
    <b>.bark</b> is pressed. In this case, I create the callback command in the
    usual way, using <b>list</b>:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    button .bark -text &quot;Bark!&quot; -command [list fido bark]
</pre>
<p class="Pp">In typical Tcl style, we use a callback to hook two independent
    components together. But suppose that the <b>dog</b> object has a graphical
    interface and owns the button itself? In this case, the <b>dog</b> must pass
    one of its own instance methods to the button it owns. The obvious thing to
    do is this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
% snit::widget dog {
    constructor {args} {
        #...
        button $win.barkbtn -text &quot;Bark!&quot; -command [list $self bark]
        #...
    }
}
::dog
%
</pre>
<p class="Pp">(Note that in this example, our <b>dog</b> becomes a
    <b>snit::widget</b>, because it has GUI behavior. See <b>WIDGETS</b> for
    more.) Thus, if we create a <b>dog</b> called <b>.spot</b>, it will create a
    Tk button called <b>.spot.barkbtn</b>; when pressed, the button will call
    <b>$self bark</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Now, this will work--provided that <b>.spot</b> is never renamed
    to something else. But surely renaming widgets is abnormal? And so it
    is--unless <b>.spot</b> is the hull component of a
    <b>snit::widgetadaptor</b>. If it is, then it will be renamed, and
    <b>.spot</b> will become the name of the <b>snit::widgetadaptor</b> object.
    When the button is pressed, the command <b>$self bark</b> will be handled by
    the <b>snit::widgetadaptor</b>, which might or might not do the right
  thing.</p>
<p class="Pp">There's a safer way to do it, and it looks like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
% snit::widget dog {
    constructor {args} {
        #...
        button $win.barkbtn -text &quot;Bark!&quot; -command [mymethod bark]
        #...
    }
}
::dog
%
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The command <b>mymethod</b> takes any number of arguments, and can
    be used like <b>list</b> to build up a callback command; the only difference
    is that <b>mymethod</b> returns a form of the command that won't change even
    if the instance's name changes.</p>
<p class="Pp">On the other hand, you might prefer to allow a widgetadaptor to
    override a method such that your renamed widget will call the
    widgetadaptor's method instead of its own. In this case, using <b>[list
    $self bark]</b> will do what you want...but this is a technique which should
    be used only in carefully controlled circumstances.</p>

<p class="Pp">First, every Snit object has a built-in instance variable called
    <b>options</b>, which should never be redefined.</p>
<p class="Pp">Second, all names beginning with &quot;Snit_&quot; are reserved
    for use by Snit internal code.</p>
<p class="Pp">Third, instance variable names containing the namespace delimiter
    (<b>::</b>) are likely to cause great confusion.</p>

  I NEED TO DECLARE MY INSTANCE VARIABLES IN MY METHODS?</a></h2>
No. Once you've defined an instance variable in the type definition, it can be
  used in any instance code (instance methods, the constructor, and the
  destructor) without declaration. This differs from normal Tcl practice, in
  which all non-local variables in a proc need to be declared.
<p class="Pp">There is a speed penalty to having all instance variables
    implicitly available in all instance code. Even though your code need not
    declare the variables explicitly, Snit must still declare them, and that
    takes time. If you have ten instance variables, a method that uses none of
    them must still pay the declaration penalty for all ten. In most cases, the
    additional runtime cost is negligible. If extreme cases, you might wish to
    avoid it; there are two methods for doing so.</p>
<p class="Pp">The first is to define a single instance variable, an array, and
    store all of your instance data in the array. This way, you're only paying
    the declaration penalty for one variable--and you probably need the variable
    most of the time anyway. This method breaks down if your instance variables
    include multiple arrays; in Tcl 8.5, however, the <b>dict</b> command might
    come to your rescue.</p>
<p class="Pp">The second method is to declare your instance variables explicitly
    in your instance code, while <i>not</i> including them in the type
    definition:</p>
<pre>
snit::type dog {
    constructor {} {
        variable mood
        set mood happy
    }
    method setmood {newMood} {
        variable mood
        set mood $newMood
    }
    method getmood {} {
        variable mood
        return $mood
    }
}
</pre>
This allows you to ensure that only the required variables are included in each
  method, at the cost of longer code and run-time errors when you forget to
  declare a variable you need.

In Tk, it's common to pass a widget a variable name; for example, Tk label
  widgets have a <b>-textvariable</b> option which names the variable which will
  contain the widget's text. This allows the program to update the label's value
  just by assigning a new value to the variable.
<p class="Pp">If you naively pass the instance variable name to the label
    widget, you'll be confused by the result; Tk will assume that the name names
    a global variable. Instead, you need to provide a fully-qualified variable
    name. From within an instance method or a constructor, you can fully qualify
    the variable's name using the <b>myvar</b> command:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
snit::widget mywidget {

A type's options are the equivalent of what other object-oriented languages
  would call public member variables or properties: they are data values which
  can be retrieved and (usually) set by the clients of an object.
<p class="Pp">Snit's implementation of options follows the Tk model fairly
    exactly, except that <b>snit::type</b> objects usually don't interact with
    <b>THE TK OPTION DATABASE</b>; <b>snit::widget</b> and
    <b>snit::widgetadaptor</b> objects, on the other hand, always do.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="HOW_DO_I_DEFINE_AN_OPTION?"><a class="permalink" href="#HOW_DO_I_DEFINE_AN_OPTION?">HOW
  DO I DEFINE AN OPTION?</a></h2>
Options are defined in the type definition using the <b>option</b> statement.
  Consider the following type, to be used in an application that manages a list
  of dogs for a pet store:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
snit::type dog {
    option -breed -default mongrel
    option -color -default brown
    option -akc   -default 0
    option -shots -default 0
}
</pre>
<p class="Pp">According to this, a dog has four notable properties: a breed, a
    color, a flag that says whether it's pedigreed with the American Kennel
    Club, and another flag that says whether it has had its shots. The default
    dog, evidently, is a brown mutt.</p>
<p class="Pp">There are a number of options you can specify when defining an
    option; if <b>-default</b> is the only one, you can omit the word
    <b>-default</b> as follows:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
snit::type dog {
    option -breed mongrel
    option -color brown
    option -akc   0
    option -shots 0
}
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If no <b>-default</b> value is specified, the option's default
    value will be the empty string (but see <b>THE TK OPTION DATABASE</b>).</p>
<p class="Pp">The Snit man page refers to options like these as &quot;locally
    defined&quot; options.</p>

The normal convention is that the client may pass any number of options and
  their values after the object's name at object creation. For example, the
  <b>::dog</b> command defined in the previous answer can now be used to create
  individual dogs. Any or all of the options may be set at creation time.
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
% dog spot -breed beagle -color &quot;mottled&quot; -akc 1 -shots 1
::spot
% dog fido -shots 1
::fido
%
</pre>
<p class="Pp">So <b>::spot</b> is a pedigreed beagle; <b>::fido</b> is a typical
    mutt, but his owners evidently take care of him, because he's had his
  shots.</p>

Any number of options may be set at one time using the <b>configure</b> instance

<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
% fido configure -color dun -breed &quot;Arctic Boar Hound&quot;
% fido cget -color
dun
% fido cget -breed
Arctic Boar Hound
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Alternatively, the <b>configurelist</b> method takes a list of
    options and values; occasionally this is more convenient:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
% set features [list -color dun -breed &quot;Arctic Boar Hound&quot;]
-color dun -breed {Arctic Boar Hound}
% fido configurelist $features
% fido cget -color
dun
% fido cget -breed
Arctic Boar Hound
%
</pre>
<p class="Pp">In Tcl 8.5, the <b>*</b> keyword can be used with <b>configure</b>
    in this case:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
% set features [list -color dun -breed &quot;Arctic Boar Hound&quot;]

  SHOULD AN INSTANCE METHOD ACCESS AN OPTION VALUE?</a></h2>
There are two ways an instance method can set and retrieve an option's value.
  One is to use the <b>configure</b> and <b>cget</b> methods, as shown below.
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
% snit::type dog {
    option -weight 10
    method gainWeight {} {
        set wt [$self cget -weight]
        incr wt
        $self configure -weight $wt
    }
}
::dog
% dog fido
::fido
% fido cget -weight
10
% fido gainWeight
% fido cget -weight
11
%
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Alternatively, Snit provides a built-in array instance variable
    called <b>options</b>. The indices are the option names; the values are the
    option values. The method <b>gainWeight</b> can thus be rewritten as
    follows:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    method gainWeight {} {
        incr options(-weight)
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">As you can see, using the <b>options</b> variable involves
    considerably less typing and is the usual way to do it. But if you use
    <b>-configuremethod</b> or <b>-cgetmethod</b> (described in the following
    answers), you might wish to use the <b>configure</b> and <b>cget</b> methods
    anyway, just so that any special processing you've implemented is sure to
    get done. Also, if the option is delegated to a component then
    <b>configure</b> and <b>cget</b> are the only way to access it without
    accessing the component directly. See <b>DELEGATION</b> for more
    information.</p>

Define the option with <b>-readonly yes</b>.
<p class="Pp">Suppose you've got an option that determines how instances of your

Method argument lists are defined just like normal Tcl proc argument lists; in

<p class="Pp">However, every type method is called with an implicit argument

If an instance or type method needs to call a type method, it should use

It's common in Tcl to pass a snippet of code to another object, for it to call
  later. Because types cannot be renamed, you can just use the type name, or, if
  the callback is registered from within a type method, <b>type</b>. For
  example, suppose we want to print a list of pedigreed dogs when a Tk button is
  pushed:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
button .btn -text &quot;Pedigrees&quot; -command [list dog printPedigrees]
pack .btn

  command, just as you would use <b>mymethod</b> to define a callback command

A type constructor is a body of code that initializes the type as a whole,

A type constructor is defined by using the <b>typeconstructor</b> statement in

Yes, you can. For example, suppose we wanted to be sure that the breed was

<p class="Pp">The drawback is that this syntax is non-standard, and may limit

Yes. If an object's constructor throws an error, the object's destructor will be
  called to clean up; this means that the object might not be completely
  constructed when the destructor is called. This can cause the destructor to
  throw its own error; the result is usually misleading, confusing, and
  unhelpful. Consequently, it's important to write your destructor so that it's
  fail-safe.
<p class="Pp">For example, a <b>dog</b> might create a <b>tail</b> component;
    the component will need to be destroyed. But suppose there's an error while
    processing the creation options--the destructor will be called, and there
    will be no <b>tail</b> to destroy. The simplest solution is generally to
    catch and ignore any errors while destroying components.</p>

Often an object will create and manage a number of other objects. A Snit

First, you must decide what role a component plays within your object, and give
  the role a name. Then, you declare the component using its role name and the
  <b>component</b> statement. The <b>component</b> statement declares an
  <i>instance variable</i> which is used to store the component's command name
  when the component is created.
<p class="Pp">For example, suppose your <b>dog</b> object creates a <b>tail</b>
    object (the better to wag with, no doubt):</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>

snit::type dog {

A component has two names. The first name is that of the component variable;
  this represents the role the component object plays within the Snit object.
  This is the component name proper, and is the name used to refer to the
  component within Snit code. The second name is the name of the actual
  component object created by the Snit object's constructor. This second name is
  always a Tcl command name, and is referred to as the component's object name.
<p class="Pp">In the example in the previous question, the component name is
    <b>mytail</b>; the <b>mytail</b> component's object name is chosen
    automatically by Snit since <b>%AUTO%</b> was used when the component object

Yes. <b>snit::widget</b> and <b>snit::widgetadaptor</b> objects have a special
  component called the <b>hull</b> component; thus, the name <b>hull</b> should

<h2 class="Ss" id="WHAT_IS_AN_OWNED_COMPONENT?"><a class="permalink" href="#WHAT_IS_AN_OWNED_COMPONENT?">WHAT

An <i>owned</i> component is a component whose object command's lifetime is
  controlled by the <b>snit::type</b> or <b>snit::widget</b>.
<p class="Pp">As stated above, a component is an object to which our object can
    delegate methods or options. Under this definition, our object will usually
    create its component objects, but not necessarily. Consider the following: a
    dog object has a tail component; but tail knows that it's part of the
  dog:</p>
<pre>
snit::type dog {
    component mytail
    constructor {args} {
        set mytail [tail %AUTO% -partof $self]
        $self configurelist $args
    }
    destructor {
        catch {$mytail destroy}
    }
    delegate method wagtail to mytail as wag
    method bark {} {
        return &quot;$self barked.&quot;
    }
}
 snit::type tail {
     component mydog
     option -partof -readonly yes
     constructor {args} {
         $self configurelist $args
         set mydog $options(-partof)
     }
     method wag {} {
         return &quot;Wag, wag.&quot;
     }
     method pull {} {
         $mydog bark
     }
 }
</pre>
Thus, if you ask a dog to wag its tail, it tells its tail to wag; and if you
  pull the dog's tail, the tail tells the dog to bark. In this scenario, the
  tail is a component of the dog, and the dog is a component of the tail, but
  the dog owns the tail and not the other way around.

The <b>install</b> command creates an owned component using a specified command,
  and assigns the result to the component's instance variable. For example:
<pre>
snit::type dog {
    component mytail
    constructor {args} {

    }
}
</pre>
In a <b>snit::type</b>'s code, the <b>install</b> command shown above is
  equivalent to the <b>set mytail</b> command that's commented out. In a
  <b>snit::widget</b>'s or <b>snit::widgetadaptor</b>'s, code, however, the
  <b>install</b> command also queries <b>THE TK OPTION DATABASE</b> and
  initializes the new component's options accordingly. For consistency, it's a
  good idea to get in the habit of using <b>install</b> for all owned
  components.

Yes.
<p class="Pp">Component objects which are Tk widgets or megawidgets must have
    valid Tk window names.</p>
<p class="Pp">Component objects which are not widgets or megawidgets must have
    fully-qualified command names, i.e., names which include the full namespace
    of the command. Note that Snit always creates objects with fully qualified
    names.</p>
<p class="Pp">Next, the object names of components and owned by your object must
    be unique. This is no problem for widget components, since widget names are
    always unique; but consider the following code:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
snit::type tail { ... }
snit::type dog {
    delegate method wag to mytail
    constructor {} {
        install mytail using tail mytail
    }
}
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This code uses the component name, <b>mytail</b>, as the component
    object name. This is not good, and here's why: Snit instance code executes
    in the Snit type's namespace. In this case, the <b>mytail</b> component is
    created in the <b>::dog::</b> namespace, and will thus have the name
    <b>::dog::mytail</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Now, suppose you create two dogs. Both dogs will attempt to create
    a tail called <b>::dog::mytail</b>. The first will succeed, and the second
    will fail, since Snit won't let you create an object if its name is already
    a command. Here are two ways to avoid this situation:</p>
<p class="Pp">First, if the component type is a <b>snit::type</b> you can
    specify <b>%AUTO%</b> as its name, and be guaranteed to get a unique name.
    This is the safest thing to do:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    install mytail using tail %AUTO%
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If the component type isn't a <b>snit::type</b> you can create the
    component in the object's instance namespace:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    install mytail using tail ${selfns}::mytail
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Make sure you pick a unique name within the instance
  namespace.</p>

  automatically. Thus, if your object is a <b>snit::widget</b> or
  <b>snit::widgetadaptor</b> you don't need to destroy any components that are
  widgets, because they will generally be children or descendants of your
  megawidget.
<p class="Pp">If your object is an instance of <b>snit::type</b>, though, none
    of its owned components will be destroyed automatically, nor will be
    non-widget components of a <b>snit::widget</b> be destroyed automatically.
    All such owned components must be destroyed explicitly, or they won't be
    destroyed at all.</p>

Yes, and there are two ways to do it. The most appropriate way is usually to use
  <b>DELEGATION</b>. Delegation allows you to pass the options and methods you
  specify along to particular components. This effectively hides the components
  from the users of your type, and ensures good encapsulation.
<p class="Pp">However, there are times when it's appropriate, not to mention
    simpler, just to make the entire component part of your type's public

When you declare the component, specify the <b>component</b> statement's
  <b>-public</b> option. The value of this option is the name of a method which
  will be delegated to your component's object command.
<p class="Pp">For example, supposed you've written a combobox megawidget which
    owns a listbox widget, and you want to make the listbox's entire interface
    public. You can do it like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
snit::widget combobox {
     component listbox -public listbox
     constructor {args} {
         install listbox using listbox $win.listbox ....
     }
}
combobox .mycombo
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Your comobox widget, <b>.mycombo</b>, now has a <b>listbox</b>
    method which has all of the same subcommands as the listbox widget itself.
    Thus, the above code sets the listbox component's width to 30.</p>
<p class="Pp">Usually you'll let the method name be the same as the component

A type component is a component that belongs to the type itself instead of to a

Declare a type component using the <b>typecomponent</b> statement. It takes the

Delegation, simply put, is when you pass a task you've been given to one of your
  assistants. (You do have assistants, don't you?) Snit objects can do the same
  thing. The following example shows one way in which the <b>dog</b> object can
  delegate its <b>wag</b> method and its <b>-taillength</b> option to its
  <b>tail</b> component.
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
snit::type dog {
    variable mytail
    option -taillength -configuremethod SetTailOption -cgetmethod GetTailOption
    method SetTailOption {option value} {

  CAN I DELEGATE A METHOD TO A COMPONENT OBJECT?</a></h2>
Delegation occurs frequently enough that Snit makes it easy. Any method can be
  delegated to any component or type component by placing a single
  <b>delegate</b> statement in the type definition. (See <b>COMPONENTS</b> and
  <b>TYPE COMPONENTS</b> for more information about component names.)
<p class="Pp">For example, here's a much better way to delegate the <b>dog</b>
    object's <b>wag</b> method:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
% snit::type dog {
    delegate method wag to mytail
    constructor {} {
        install mytail using tail %AUTO%
    }
}
::dog
% snit::type tail {
    method wag {} { return &quot;Wag, wag, wag.&quot;}
}
::tail
% dog spot
::spot
% spot wag
Wag, wag, wag.
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This code has the same effect as the code shown under the previous
    question: when a <b>dog</b>'s <b>wag</b> method is called, the call and its
    arguments are passed along automatically to the <b>tail</b> object.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that when a component is mentioned in a <b>delegate</b>
    statement, the component's instance variable is defined implicitly. However,
    it's still good practice to declare it explicitly using the <b>component</b>
    statement.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note also that you can define a method name using the
    <b>method</b> statement, or you can define it using <b>delegate</b>; you
    can't do both.</p>

  I DELEGATE A METHOD TO SOMETHING OTHER THAN AN OBJECT?</a></h2>
Normal method delegation assumes that you're delegating a method (a subcommand
  of an object command) to a method of another object (a subcommand of a
  different object command). But not all Tcl objects follow Tk conventions, and
  not everything you'd to which you'd like to delegate a method is necessary an
  object. Consequently, Snit makes it easy to delegate a method to pretty much
  anything you like using the <b>delegate</b> statement's <b>using</b> clause.
<p class="Pp">Suppose your dog simulation stores dogs in a database, each dog as
    a single record. The database API you're using provides a number of commands
    to manage records; each takes the record ID (a string you choose) as its
    first argument. For example, <b>saverec</b> saves a record. If you let the
    record ID be the name of the dog object, you can delegate the dog's
    <b>save</b> method to the <b>saverec</b> command as follows:</p>
<pre>
snit::type dog {
    delegate method save using {saverec %s}
}
</pre>
The <b>%s</b> is replaced with the instance name when the <b>save</b> method is
  called; any additional arguments are the appended to the resulting command.
<p class="Pp">The <b>using</b> clause understands a number of other
    %-conversions; in addition to the instance name, you can substitute in the
    method name (<b>%m</b>), the type name (<b>%t</b>), the instance namespace
    (<b>%n</b>), the Tk window name (<b>%w</b>), and, if a component or
    typecomponent name was given in the <b>delegate</b> statement, the
    component's object command (<b>%c</b>).</p>

Just exactly as you would to a component object. The <b>delegate method</b>
  statement accepts both component and type component names in its <b>to</b>
  clause.

Use the <b>delegate typemethod</b> statement. It works like <b>delegate
  method</b>, with these differences: first, it defines a type method instead of
  an instance method; second, the <b>using</b> clause ignores the <b>%s</b>,
  <b>%n</b>, and <b>%w</b> %-conversions.

  CAN I DELEGATE AN OPTION TO A COMPONENT OBJECT?</a></h2>
The first question in this section (see <b>DELEGATION</b>) shows one way to
  delegate an option to a component; but this pattern occurs often enough that
  Snit makes it easy. For example, every <b>tail</b> object has a <b>-length</b>
  option; we want to allow the creator of a <b>dog</b> object to set the tail's
  length. We can do this:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
% snit::type dog {
    delegate option -length to mytail
    constructor {args} {
        install mytail using tail %AUTO% -partof $self
        $self configurelist $args
    }
}
::dog
% snit::type tail {
    option -partof
    option -length 5
}
::tail
% dog spot -length 7
::spot
% spot cget -length
7
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This produces nearly the same result as the
    <b>-configuremethod</b> and <b>-cgetmethod</b> shown under the first
    question in this section: whenever a <b>dog</b> object's <b>-length</b>
    option is set or retrieved, the underlying <b>tail</b> object's option is
    set or retrieved in turn.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that you can define an option name using the <b>option</b>
    statement, or you can define it using <b>delegate</b>; you can't do
  both.</p>

  I DELEGATE TO AN OPTION WITH A DIFFERENT NAME?</a></h2>
In the previous answer we delegated the <b>dog</b>'s <b>-length</b> option down
  to its <b>tail</b>. This is, of course, wrong. The dog has a length, and the
  tail has a length, and they are different. What we'd really like to do is give
  the <b>dog</b> a <b>-taillength</b> option, but delegate it to the
  <b>tail</b>'s <b>-length</b> option:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
snit::type dog {
    delegate option -taillength to mytail as -length

It may happen that a Snit object gets most of its behavior from one of its
  components. This often happens with <b>snit::widgetadaptors</b>, for example,
  where we wish to slightly the modify the behavior of an existing widget. To
  carry on with our <b>dog</b> example, however, suppose that we have a
  <b>snit::type</b> called <b>animal</b> that implements a variety of animal
  behaviors--moving, eating, sleeping, and so forth. We want our <b>dog</b>
  objects to inherit these same behaviors, while adding dog-like behaviors of
  its own. Here's how we can give a <b>dog</b> methods and options of its own
  while delegating all other methods and options to its <b>animal</b> component:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
snit::type dog {
    delegate option * to animal
    delegate method * to animal
    option -akc 0
    constructor {args} {
        install animal using animal %AUTO% -name $self
        $self configurelist $args
    }
    method wag {} {
        return &quot;$self wags its tail&quot;
    }
}
</pre>
<p class="Pp">That's it. A <b>dog</b> is now an <b>animal</b> that has a
    <b>-akc</b> option and can <b>wag</b> its tail.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that we don't need to specify the full list of method names
    or option names that <b>animal</b> will receive. It gets anything <b>dog</b>
    doesn't recognize--and if it doesn't recognize it either, it will simply
    throw an error, just as it should.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can also delegate all unknown type methods to a type component
    using <b>delegate typemethod *</b>.</p>

In the previous answer, we said that every <b>dog</b> is an <b>animal</b> by
  delegating all unknown methods and options to the <b>animal</b> component. But
  what if the <b>animal</b> type has some methods or options that we'd like to
  suppress?
<p class="Pp">One solution is to explicitly delegate all the options and
    methods, and forgo the convenience of <b>delegate method *</b> and
    <b>delegate option *</b>. But if we wish to suppress only a few options or
    methods, there's an easier way:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
snit::type dog {
    delegate option * to animal except -numlegs
    delegate method * to animal except {fly climb}
    # ...
    constructor {args} {
        install animal using animal %AUTO% -name $self -numlegs 4
        $self configurelist $args
    }
    # ...
}
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Dogs have four legs, so we specify that explicitly when we create
    the <b>animal</b> component, and explicitly exclude <b>-numlegs</b> from the
    set of delegated options. Similarly, dogs can neither <b>fly</b> nor
    <b>climb</b>, so we exclude those <b>animal</b> methods as shown.</p>

Every widget, whether a genuine Tk widget or a Snit megawidget, has to have a
  valid Tk window name. When a <b>snit::widget</b> is first created, its
  instance name, <b>self</b>, is a Tk window name; however, if the
  <b>snit::widget</b> is used as the hull component by a
  <b>snit::widgetadaptor</b> its instance name will be changed to something
  else. For this reason, every <b>snit::widget</b> method, constructor,
  destructor, and so forth is passed another implicit argument, <b>win</b>,
  which is the window name of the megawidget. Any children should be named using
  <b>win</b> as the root.
<p class="Pp">Thus, suppose you're writing a toolbar widget, a frame consisting
    of a number of buttons placed side-by-side. It might look something like
    this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
snit::widget toolbar {
    delegate option * to hull
    constructor {args} {
        button $win.open -text Open -command [mymethod open]
        button $win.save -text Save -command [mymethod save]
        # ....
        $self configurelist $args
    }
}

A <b>snit::widgetadaptor</b> is a kind of <b>snit::widget</b>. Whereas a
  <b>snit::widget</b>'s hull is automatically created and is always a Tk frame,
  a <b>snit::widgetadaptor</b> can be based on any Tk widget--or on any Snit
  megawidget, or even (with luck) on megawidgets defined using some other
  package.
<p class="Pp">It's called a <i>widget adaptor</i> because it allows you to take
    an existing widget and customize its behavior.</p>

  DO I DEFINE A SNIT::WIDGETADAPTOR?</a></h2>
Use the <b>snit::widgetadaptor</b> command. The definition for a
  <b>snit::widgetadaptor</b> looks just like that for a <b>snit::type</b> or
  <b>snit::widget</b>, except that the constructor must create and install the
  hull component.
<p class="Pp">For example, the following code creates a read-only text widget by
    the simple device of turning its <b>insert</b> and <b>delete</b> methods
    into no-ops. Then, we define new methods, <b>ins</b> and <b>del</b>, which
    get delegated to the hull component as <b>insert</b> and <b>delete</b>.
    Thus, we've adapted the text widget and given it new behavior while still
    leaving it fundamentally a text widget.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
::snit::widgetadaptor rotext {
    constructor {args} {
        # Create the text widget; turn off its insert cursor
        installhull using text -insertwidth 0
        # Apply any options passed at creation time.
        $self configurelist $args
    }
    # Disable the text widget's insert and delete methods, to
    # make this readonly.
    method insert {args} {}
    method delete {args} {}
    # Enable ins and del as synonyms, so the program can insert and
    # delete.
    delegate method ins to hull as insert
    delegate method del to hull as delete
    # Pass all other methods and options to the real text widget, so
    # that the remaining behavior is as expected.
    delegate method * to hull
    delegate option * to hull
}
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The most important part is in the constructor. Whereas
    <b>snit::widget</b> creates the hull for you, <b>snit::widgetadaptor</b>
    cannot -- it doesn't know what kind of widget you want. So the first thing
    the constructor does is create the hull component (a Tk text widget in this
    case), and then installs it using the <b>installhull</b> command.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Note:</i> There is no instance command until you create one by
    installing a hull component. Any attempt to pass methods to <b>$self</b>
    prior to calling <b>installhull</b> will fail.</p>

  I ADAPT A WIDGET CREATED ELSEWHERE IN THE PROGRAM?</a></h2>
Yes.
<p class="Pp">At times, it can be convenient to adapt a pre-existing widget
    instead of creating your own. For example, the Bwidget <b>PagesManager</b>
    widget manages a set of <b>frame</b> widgets, only one of which is visible
    at a time. The application chooses which <b>frame</b> is visible. All of the
    These <b>frame</b>s are created by the <b>PagesManager</b> itself, using its
    <b>add</b> method. It's convenient to adapt these frames to do what we'd
    like them to do.</p>
<p class="Pp">In a case like this, the Tk widget will already exist when the
    <b>snit::widgetadaptor</b> is created. Snit provides an alternate form of
    the <b>installhull</b> command for this purpose:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
snit::widgetadaptor pageadaptor {
    constructor {args} {
        # The widget already exists; just install it.
        installhull $win
        # ...

Maybe. If the other megawidget is a <b>snit::widget</b> or
  <b>snit::widgetadaptor</b>, then yes. If it isn't then, again, maybe. You'll
  have to try it and see. You're most likely to have trouble with widget
  destruction--you have to make sure that your megawidget code receives the
  <b>&lt;Destroy&gt;</b> event before the megawidget you're adapting does.

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="WHAT_IS_THE_TK_OPTION_DATABASE?"><a class="permalink" href="#WHAT_IS_THE_TK_OPTION_DATABASE?">WHAT
  IS THE TK OPTION DATABASE?</a></h2>
The Tk option database is a database of default option values maintained by Tk
  itself; every Tk application has one. The concept of the option database
  derives from something called the X Windows resource database; however, the
  option database is available in every Tk implementation, including those which
  do not use the X Windows system (e.g., Microsoft Windows).
<p class="Pp">Full details about the Tk option database are beyond the scope of
    this document; both <i>Practical Programming in Tcl and Tk</i> by Welch,
    Jones, and Hobbs, and <i>Effective Tcl/Tk Programming</i> by Harrison and
    McClennan., have good introductions to it.</p>
<p class="Pp">Snit is implemented so that most of the time it will simply do the
    right thing with respect to the option database, provided that the widget
    developer does the right thing by Snit. The body of this section goes into
    great deal about what Snit requires. The following is a brief statement of
    the requirements, for reference.</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>If the widget's default widget class is not what is desired, set it
      explicitly using the <b>widgetclass</b> statement in the widget
      definition.</li>
  <li>When defining or delegating options, specify the resource and class names
      explicitly when necessary.</li>
  <li>Use the <b>installhull using</b> command to create and install the hull
      for <b>snit::widgetadaptor</b>s.</li>
  <li>Use the <b>install</b> command to create and install all components which
      are widgets.</li>
  <li>Use the <b>install</b> command to create and install components which
      aren't widgets if you'd like them to receive option values from the option
      database.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">The interaction of Tk widgets with the option database is a
    complex thing; the interaction of Snit with the option database is even more
    so, and repays attention to detail.</p>

No, they don't; querying the option database requires a Tk window name, and
  <b>snit::type</b>s don't have one.
<p class="Pp">If you create an instance of a <b>snit::type</b> as a component of
    a <b>snit::widget</b> or <b>snit::widgetadaptor</b>, on the other hand, and
    if any options are delegated to the component, and if you use <b>install</b>
    to create and install it, then the megawidget will query the option database
    on the <b>snit::type</b>'s behalf. This might or might not be what you want,
    so take care.</p>

  IS MY SNIT::WIDGET'S WIDGET CLASS?</a></h2>
Every Tk widget has a &quot;widget class&quot;: a name that is used when adding
  option settings to the database. For Tk widgets, the widget class is the same
  as the widget command name with an initial capital. For example, the widget
  class of the Tk <b>button</b> widget is <b>Button</b>.
<p class="Pp">Similarly, the widget class of a <b>snit::widget</b> defaults to
    the unqualified type name with the first letter capitalized. For example,
    the widget class of</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
snit::widget ::mylibrary::scrolledText { ... }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">is <b>ScrolledText</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The widget class can also be set explicitly using the
    <b>widgetclass</b> statement within the <b>snit::widget</b> definition:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
snit::widget ::mylibrary::scrolledText {
    widgetclass Text
    # ...
}
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The above definition says that a <b>scrolledText</b> megawidget
    has the same widget class as an ordinary <b>text</b> widget. This might or
    might not be a good idea, depending on how the rest of the megawidget is
    defined, and how its options are delegated.</p>

The widget class of a <b>snit::widgetadaptor</b> is just the widget class of its
  hull widget; Snit has no control over this.
<p class="Pp">Note that the widget class can be changed only for <b>frame</b>
    and <b>toplevel</b> widgets, which is why these are the valid hull types for
    <b>snit::widget</b>s.</p>
<p class="Pp">Try to use <b>snit::widgetadaptor</b>s only to make small
    modifications to another widget's behavior. Then, it will usually not make

<h2 class="Ss" id="WHAT_ARE_OPTION_RESOURCE_AND_CLASS_NAMES?"><a class="permalink" href="#WHAT_ARE_OPTION_RESOURCE_AND_CLASS_NAMES?">WHAT
  ARE OPTION RESOURCE AND CLASS NAMES?</a></h2>
Every Tk widget option has three names: the option name, the resource name, and
  the class name. The option name begins with a hyphen and is all lowercase;
  it's used when creating widgets, and with the <b>configure</b> and <b>cget</b>
  commands.
<p class="Pp">The resource and class names are used to initialize option default
    values by querying the option database. The resource name is usually just
    the option name minus the hyphen, but may contain uppercase letters at word
    boundaries; the class name is usually just the resource name with an initial
    capital, but not always. For example, here are the option, resource, and
    class names for several Tk <b>text</b> widget options:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    -background         background         Background
    -borderwidth        borderWidth        BorderWidth
    -insertborderwidth  insertBorderWidth  BorderWidth
    -padx               padX               Pad
</pre>
<p class="Pp">As is easily seen, sometimes the resource and class names can be
    inferred from the option name, but not always.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="WHAT_ARE_THE_RESOURCE_AND_CLASS_NAMES_FOR_MY_MEGAWIDGET'S_OPTIONS?"><a class="permalink" href="#WHAT_ARE_THE_RESOURCE_AND_CLASS_NAMES_FOR_MY_MEGAWIDGET'S_OPTIONS?">WHAT
  ARE THE RESOURCE AND CLASS NAMES FOR MY MEGAWIDGET'S OPTIONS?</a></h2>
For options implicitly delegated to a component using <b>delegate option *</b>,
  the resource and class names will be exactly those defined by the component.
  The <b>configure</b> method returns these names, along with the option's
  default and current values:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
% snit::widget mytext {
    delegate option * to text
    constructor {args} {
        install text using text .text
        # ...
    }
    # ...
}
::mytext
% mytext .text
% .text configure -padx
-padx padX Pad 1 1
%
</pre>
<p class="Pp">For all other options (whether locally defined or explicitly
    delegated), the resource and class names can be defined explicitly, or they
    can be allowed to have default values.</p>
<p class="Pp">By default, the resource name is just the option name minus the
    hyphen; the the class name is just the option name with an initial capital
    letter. For example, suppose we explicitly delegate &quot;-padx&quot;:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
% snit::widget mytext {
    option -myvalue 5
    delegate option -padx to text
    delegate option * to text
    constructor {args} {
        install text using text .text
        # ...
    }
    # ...
}
::mytext
% mytext .text
% .text configure -myvalue
-myvalue myvalue Myvalue 5 5
% .text configure -padx
-padx padx Padx 1 1
%
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Here the resource and class names are chosen using the default
    rules. Often these rules are sufficient, but in the case of
    &quot;-padx&quot; we'd most likely prefer that the option's resource and
    class names are the same as for the built-in Tk widgets. This is easily
    done:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
% snit::widget mytext {
    delegate option {-padx padX Pad} to text
    # ...
}
::mytext
% mytext .text
% .text configure -padx
-padx padX Pad 1 1

  DOES SNIT INITIALIZE MY MEGAWIDGET'S LOCALLY-DEFINED OPTIONS?</a></h2>
The option database is queried for each of the megawidget's locally-defined
  options, using the option's resource and class name. If the result isn't
  &quot;&quot;, then it replaces the default value given in widget definition.
  In either case, the default can be overridden by the caller. For example,
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
option add *Mywidget.texture pebbled
snit::widget mywidget {
    option -texture smooth
    # ...
}
mywidget .mywidget -texture greasy
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Here, <b>-texture</b> would normally default to
    &quot;smooth&quot;, but because of the entry added to the option database it
    defaults to &quot;pebbled&quot;. However, the caller has explicitly
    overridden the default, and so the new widget will be
  &quot;greasy&quot;.</p>

That depends on whether the options are delegated to the hull, or to some other

  DOES SNIT INITIALIZE OPTIONS DELEGATED TO THE HULL?</a></h2>
A <b>snit::widget</b>'s hull is a widget, and given that its class has been set
  it is expected to query the option database for itself. The only exception
  concerns options that are delegated to it with a different name. Consider the
  following code:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
option add *Mywidget.borderWidth 5
option add *Mywidget.relief sunken
option add *Mywidget.hullbackground red
option add *Mywidget.background green
snit::widget mywidget {
    delegate option -borderwidth to hull
    delegate option -hullbackground to hull as -background
    delegate option * to hull
    # ...
}
mywidget .mywidget
set A [.mywidget cget -relief]
set B [.mywidget cget -hullbackground]
set C [.mywidget cget -background]
set D [.mywidget cget -borderwidth]
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The question is, what are the values of variables A, B, C and
  D?</p>
<p class="Pp">The value of A is &quot;sunken&quot;. The hull is a Tk frame which
    has been given the widget class <b>Mywidget</b>; it will automatically query
    the option database and pick up this value. Since the <b>-relief</b> option
    is implicitly delegated to the hull, Snit takes no action.</p>
<p class="Pp">The value of B is &quot;red&quot;. The hull will automatically
    pick up the value &quot;green&quot; for its <b>-background</b> option, just
    as it picked up the <b>-relief</b> value. However, Snit knows that
    <b>-hullbackground</b> is mapped to the hull's <b>-background</b> option;
    hence, it queries the option database for <b>-hullbackground</b> and gets
    &quot;red&quot; and updates the hull accordingly.</p>
<p class="Pp">The value of C is also &quot;red&quot;, because <b>-background</b>
    is implicitly delegated to the hull; thus, retrieving it is the same as
    retrieving <b>-hullbackground</b>. Note that this case is unusual; the
    <b>-background</b> option should probably have been excluded using the
    delegate statement's <b>except</b> clause, or (more likely) delegated to
    some other component.</p>
<p class="Pp">The value of D is &quot;5&quot;, but not for the reason you think.
    Note that as it is defined above, the resource name for <b>-borderwidth</b>
    defaults to <b>borderwidth</b>, whereas the option database entry is
    <b>borderWidth</b>, in accordance with the standard Tk naming for this
    option. As with <b>-relief</b>, the hull picks up its own
    <b>-borderwidth</b> option before Snit does anything. Because the option is
    delegated under its own name, Snit assumes that the correct thing has
    happened, and doesn't worry about it any further. To avoid confusion, the
    <b>-borderwidth</b> option should have been delegated like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    delegate option {-borderwidth borderWidth BorderWidth} to hull
</pre>
<p class="Pp">For <b>snit::widgetadaptor</b>s, the case is somewhat altered.
    Widget adaptors retain the widget class of their hull, and the hull is not
    created automatically by Snit. Instead, the <b>snit::widgetadaptor</b> must
    call <b>installhull</b> in its constructor. The normal way to do this is as
    follows:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
snit::widgetadaptor mywidget {
    # ...
    constructor {args} {
        # ...
        installhull using text -foreground white
        # ...
    }
    # ...
}
</pre>
<p class="Pp">In this case, the <b>installhull</b> command will create the hull
    using a command like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    set hull [text $win -foreground white]
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The hull is a <b>text</b> widget, so its widget class is
    <b>Text</b>. Just as with <b>snit::widget</b> hulls, Snit assumes that it
    will pick up all of its normal option values automatically, without help
    from Snit. Options delegated from a different name are initialized from the
    option database in the same way as described above.</p>
<p class="Pp">In earlier versions of Snit, <b>snit::widgetadaptor</b>s were
    expected to call <b>installhull</b> like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    installhull [text $win -foreground white]
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This form still works--but Snit will not query the option database
    as described above.</p>

  DOES SNIT INITIALIZE OPTIONS DELEGATED TO OTHER COMPONENTS?</a></h2>
For hull components, Snit assumes that Tk will do most of the work
  automatically. Non-hull components are somewhat more complicated, because they
  are matched against the option database twice.
<p class="Pp">A component widget remains a widget still, and is therefore
    initialized from the option database in the usual way. A <b>text</b> widget
    remains a <b>text</b> widget whether it is a component of a megawidget or
    not, and will be created as such.</p>
<p class="Pp">But then, the option database is queried for all options delegated
    to the component, and the component is initialized accordingly--provided
    that the <b>install</b> command is used to create it.</p>
<p class="Pp">Before option database support was added to Snit, the usual way to
    create a component was to simply create it in the constructor and assign its
    command name to the component variable:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
snit::widget mywidget {
    delegate option -background to myComp
    constructor {args} {
        set myComp [text $win.text -foreground black]
    }
}
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The drawback of this method is that Snit has no opportunity to
    initialize the component properly. Hence, the following approach is now
    used:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
snit::widget mywidget {
    delegate option -background to myComp
    constructor {args} {
        install myComp using text $win.text -foreground black
    }
}
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The <b>install</b> command does the following:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Builds a list of the options explicitly included in the <b>install</b>
      command--in this case, <b>-foreground</b>.</li>
  <li>Queries the option database for all options delegated explicitly to the
      named component.</li>
  <li>Creates the component using the specified command, after inserting into it
      a list of options and values read from the option database. Thus, the
      explicitly included options (like <b>-foreground</b>) will override
      anything read from the option database.</li>
  <li>If the widget definition implicitly delegated options to the component
      using <b>delegate option *</b>, then Snit calls the newly created
      component's <b>configure</b> method to receive a list of all of the
      component's options. From this Snit builds a list of options implicitly
      delegated to the component which were not explicitly included in the
      <b>install</b> command. For all such options, Snit queries the option
      database and configures the component accordingly.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">You don't really need to know all of this; just use <b>install</b>
    to install your components, and Snit will try to do the right thing.</p>

A <b>snit::type</b> never queries the option database. However, a
  <b>snit::widget</b> can have non-widget components. And if options are

  install those components, then they will be initialized from the option
  database just as widget components are.

An ensemble command is a command with subcommands. Snit objects are all ensemble

  Tcl commands <b>string</b>, <b>file</b>, and <b>clock</b>. In a sense, these
  are singleton objects--there's only one instance of them.

  CAN I CREATE AN ENSEMBLE COMMAND USING SNIT?</a></h2>
There are two ways--as a <b>snit::type</b>, or as an instance of a
  <b>snit::type</b>.

<h2 class="Ss" id="HOW_CAN_I_CREATE_AN_ENSEMBLE_COMMAND_USING_AN_INSTANCE_OF_A_SNIT::TYPE?"><a class="permalink" href="#HOW_CAN_I_CREATE_AN_ENSEMBLE_COMMAND_USING_AN_INSTANCE_OF_A_SNIT::TYPE?">HOW
  CAN I CREATE AN ENSEMBLE COMMAND USING AN INSTANCE OF A SNIT::TYPE?</a></h2>
Define a type whose <b>INSTANCE METHODS</b> are the subcommands of your ensemble
  command. Then, create an instance of the type with the desired name.
<p class="Pp">For example, the following code uses <b>DELEGATION</b> to create a
    work-alike for the standard <b>string</b> command:</p>
<pre>
snit::type ::mynamespace::mystringtype {
    delegate method * to stringhandler
    constructor {} {
        set stringhandler string
    }
}
::mynamespace::mystringtype mystring
</pre>
We create the type in a namespace, so that the type command is hidden; then we
  create a single instance with the desired name-- <b>mystring</b>, in this
  case.
<p class="Pp">This method has two drawbacks. First, it leaves the type command
    floating about. More seriously, your shiny new ensemble command will have
    <b>info</b> and <b>destroy</b> subcommands that you probably have no use
    for. But read on.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="HOW_CAN_I_CREATE_AN_ENSEMBLE_COMMAND_USING_A_SNIT::TYPE?"><a class="permalink" href="#HOW_CAN_I_CREATE_AN_ENSEMBLE_COMMAND_USING_A_SNIT::TYPE?">HOW
  CAN I CREATE AN ENSEMBLE COMMAND USING A SNIT::TYPE?</a></h2>
Define a type whose <b>TYPE METHODS</b> are the subcommands of your ensemble
  command.
<p class="Pp">For example, the following code uses <b>DELEGATION</b> to create a
    work-alike for the standard <b>string</b> command:</p>
<pre>
snit::type mystring {
    delegate typemethod * to stringhandler
    typeconstructor {
        set stringhandler string
    }
}
</pre>
Now the type command itself is your ensemble command.
<p class="Pp">This method has only one drawback, and though it's major, it's
    also surmountable. Your new ensemble command will have <b>create</b>,
    <b>info</b> and <b>destroy</b> subcommands you don't want. And worse yet,
    since the <b>create</b> method can be implicit, users of your command will
    accidentally be creating instances of your <b>mystring</b> type if they
    should mispell one of the subcommands. The command will succeed--the first
    time--but won't do what's wanted. This is very bad.</p>
<p class="Pp">The work around is to set some <b>PRAGMAS</b>, as shown here:</p>
<pre>
snit::type mystring {
    pragma -hastypeinfo    no
    pragma -hastypedestroy no
    pragma -hasinstances   no
    delegate typemethod * to stringhandler
    typeconstructor {
        set stringhandler string
    }
}
</pre>
Here we've used the <b>pragma</b> statement to tell Snit that we don't want the
  <b>info</b> typemethod or the <b>destroy</b> typemethod, and that our type has
  no instances; this eliminates the <b>create</b> typemethod and all related
  code. As a result, our ensemble command will be well-behaved, with no
  unexpected subcommands.

Set the <b>-hastypeinfo</b> pragma to <b>no</b>:

Set the <b>-hasinstances</b> pragma to <b>no</b>:
<pre>
snit::type dog {
    pragma -hasinstances no
    # ...
}
</pre>
Snit will refrain from defining the <b>create</b> type method; if you call the
  type command with an unknown method name, you'll get an error instead of a new
  instance of the type.
<p class="Pp">This is useful if you wish to use a <b>snit::type</b> to define an
    ensemble command rather than a type with instances.</p>
<p class="Pp">Pragmas <b>-hastypemethods</b> and <b>-hasinstances</b> cannot
    both be false (or there'd be nothing left).</p>

Normal Tk widget type commands don't have subcommands; all they do is create
  widgets--in Snit terms, the type command calls the <b>create</b> type method
  directly. To get the same behavior from Snit, set the <b>-hastypemethods</b>
  pragma to <b>no</b>:
<pre>
snit::type dog {
    pragma -hastypemethods no
    #...
}
# Creates ::spot
dog spot
# Tries to create an instance called ::create
dog create spot
</pre>
Pragmas <b>-hastypemethods</b> and <b>-hasinstances</b> cannot both be false (or
  there'd be nothing left).

Up until Snit 0.95, you could use any name for an instance of a
  <b>snit::type</b>, even if the name was already in use by some other object or
  command. You could do the following, for example:
<pre>
snit::type dog { ... }
dog proc
</pre>
You now have a new dog named &quot;proc&quot;, which is probably not something
  that you really wanted to do. As a result, Snit now throws an error if your
  chosen instance name names an existing command. To restore the old behavior,
  set the <b>-canreplace</b> pragma to <b>yes</b>:
<pre>
snit::type dog {
    pragma -canreplace yes
    # ...
}

In Snit 1.x, you can set the <b>-simpledispatch</b> pragma to <b>yes</b>.
<p class="Pp">Snit 1.x method dispatch is both flexible and fast, but the
    flexibility comes with a price. If your type doesn't require the
    flexibility, the <b>-simpledispatch</b> pragma allows you to substitute a
    simpler dispatch mechanism that runs quite a bit faster. The limitations are
    these:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Methods cannot be delegated.</li>
  <li><b>uplevel</b> and <b>upvar</b> do not work as expected: the caller's
      scope is two levels up rather than one.</li>
  <li>The option-handling methods (<b>cget</b>, <b>configure</b>, and
      <b>configurelist</b>) are very slightly slower.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">In Snit 2.2, the <b>-simpledispatch</b> macro is obsolete, and
    ignored; all Snit 2.2 method dispatch is faster than Snit 1.x's
    <b>-simpledispatch</b>.</p>

A Snit macro is nothing more than a Tcl proc that's defined in the Tcl
  interpreter used to compile Snit type definitions.

You can use Snit macros to define new type definition syntax, and to support
  conditional compilation.

Suppose you want your type to use a fast C extension if it's available;
  otherwise, you'll fallback to a slower Tcl implementation. You want to define
  one set of methods in the first case, and another set in the second case. But
  how can your type definition know whether the fast C extension is available or
  not?
<p class="Pp">It's easily done. Outside of any type definition, define a macro
    that returns 1 if the extension is available, and 0 otherwise:</p>
<pre>
if {$gotFastExtension} {
    snit::macro fastcode {} {return 1}
} else {
    snit::macro fastcode {} {return 0}
}
</pre>
Then, use your macro in your type definition:
<pre>
snit::type dog {
    if {[fastcode]} {
        # Fast methods
        method bark {} {...}
        method wagtail {} {...}
    } else {
        # Slow methods
        method bark {} {...}
        method wagtail {} {...}
    }
}

Use a macro. For example, your <b>snit::widget</b>'s <b>-background</b> option
  should be propagated to a number of component widgets. You could implement
  that like this:
<pre>
snit::widget mywidget {
    option -background -default white -configuremethod PropagateBackground
    method PropagateBackground {option value} {
        $comp1 configure $option $value
        $comp2 configure $option $value
        $comp3 configure $option $value
    }
}
</pre>
For one option, this is fine; if you've got a number of options, it becomes
  tedious and error prone. So package it as a macro:
<pre>
snit::macro propagate {option &quot;to&quot; components} {
    option $option -configuremethod Propagate$option
    set body &quot;\n&quot;
    foreach comp $components {
        append body &quot;\$$comp configure $option \$value\n&quot;
    }
    method Propagate$option {option value} $body
}
</pre>
Then you can use it like this:
<pre>
snit::widget mywidget {
    option -background default -white
    option -foreground default -black
    propagate -background to {comp1 comp2 comp3}
    propagate -foreground to {comp1 comp2 comp3}
}
</pre>

Yes, there are. You can't redefine any standard Tcl commands or Snit type
  definition statements. You can use any other command name, including the name
  of a previously defined macro.
<p class="Pp">If you're using Snit macros in your application, go ahead and name
    them in the global namespace, as shown above. But if you're using them to
    define types or widgets for use by others, you should define your macros in
    the same namespace as your types or widgets. That way, they won't conflict
    with other people's macros.</p>
<p class="Pp">If my fancy <b>snit::widget</b> is called
    <b>::mylib::mywidget</b>, for example, then I should define my
    <b>propagate</b> macro as <b>::mylib::propagate</b>:</p>
<pre>
snit::macro mylib::propagate {option &quot;to&quot; components} { ... }
snit::widget ::mylib::mywidget {
    option -background default -white
    option -foreground default -black
    mylib::propagate -background to {comp1 comp2 comp3}
    mylib::propagate -foreground to {comp1 comp2 comp3}
