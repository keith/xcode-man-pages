One line invocation - option hints are processed while the module is loaded:
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  # load module and process option file hints in @ARGV
  use Getopt::ArgvFile default=&gt;1;
   
  # load another module to evaluate the options, e.g.:
  use Getopt::Long;
  ...

  # evaluate options, e.g. this common way:
  GetOptions(\%options, 'any');    # this function is defined in Getopt::Long
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Or suppress option hint processing when the module is loaded, to
    perform it later on:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  # load module, do *not* process option file hints
  use Getopt::ArgvFile justload=&gt;1;
   
  # load another module to evaluate the options, e.g.:
  use Getopt::Long;
  ...

  # *now*, solve option file hints
  Getopt::ArgvFile::argvFile(default=&gt;1);

  # evaluate options, e.g. this common way:
  GetOptions(\%options, 'any');    # this function is defined in Getopt::Long
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Or use the traditional two step invocation of module loading with
    <i>symbol import</i> and <i>explicit</i> option file handling:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  # Load the module and import the &amp;argvFile symbol
  # - this will *not* process option hints.
  # Use *this* syntax to do so, *exactly*.
  use Getopt::ArgvFile qw(argvFile);

  # load another module to evaluate the options, e.g.:
  use Getopt::Long;
  ...

  # *now*, solve option file hints
  argvFile(default=&gt;1);

  # evaluate options, e.g. this common way:
  GetOptions(\%options, 'any');    # this function is defined in Getopt::Long
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If options should be processed into another array, this can be
    done this way:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  # prepare target array
  my @options=('@options1', '@options2', '@options3');

  ...

  # replace file hints by the options stored in the files
  argvFile(array=&gt;\@options);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">In case you do not like the &quot;@&quot; prefix it is possible to
    define an option to be used instead:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  # prepare target array
  my @options=('-options', 'options1', '-options', 'options2');

<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
This module simply interpolates option file hints in
  <span class="Li">@ARGV</span> by the contents of the pointed files. This
  enables option reading from <i>files</i> instead of or additional to the usual
  reading from the command line.
<p class="Pp">Alternatively, you can process any array instead of
    <span class="Li">@ARGV</span> which is used by default and mentioned mostly
    in this manual.</p>
<p class="Pp">The interpolated <span class="Li">@ARGV</span> could be
    subsequently processed by the usual option handling, e.g. by a Getopt::xxx
    module. Getopt::ArgvFile does <i>not</i> perform any option handling itself,
    it only prepares the array <span class="Li">@ARGV</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Option files can significantly simplify the call of a script.
    Imagine the following:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>Breaking command line limits</dt>
  <dd>A script may offer a lot of options, with possibly a few of them even
      taking parameters. If these options and their parameters are passed onto
      the program call directly, the number of characters accepted by your
      shells command line may be exceeded.
    <p class="Pp">Perl itself does <i>not</i> limit the number of characters
        passed to a script by parameters, but the shell or command interpreter
        often <i>sets</i> a limit here. The same problem may occur if you want
        to store a long call in a system file like crontab.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If such a limit restricts you, options and parameters may be
        moved into option files, which will result in a shorter command line
        call.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Script calls prepared by scripts</dt>
  <dd>Sometimes a script calls another script. The options passed onto the
      nested script could depend on variable situations, such as a users input
      or the detected environment. In such a case, it <i>can</i> be easier to
      generate an intermediate option file which is then passed to the nested
      script.
    <p class="Pp">Or imagine two cron jobs one preparing the other: the first
        may generate an option file which is then used by the second.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Simple access to typical calling scenarios</dt>
  <dd>If several options need to be set, but in certain circumstances are always
      the same, it could become sligthly nerveracking to type them in again and
      again. With an option file, they can be stored <i>once</i> and recalled
      easily as often as necessary.
    <p class="Pp">Further more, option files may be used to group options.
        Several settings may set up one certain behaviour of the program, while
        others influence another. Or a certain set of options may be useful in
        one typical situation, while another one should be used elsewhere. Or
        there is a common set of options which has to be used in every call,
        while other options are added depending on the current needs. Or there
        are a few user groups with different but typical ways to call your
        script. In all these cases, option files may collect options belonging
        together, and may be combined by the script users to set up a certain
        call. In conjunction with the possiblity to <i>nest</i> such
        collections, this is perhaps the most powerful feature provided by this
        method.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Individual and installationwide default options</dt>
  <dd>The module allows the programmer to enable user setups of default options;
      for both individual users or generally <i>all</i> callers of a script.
      This is especially useful for administrators who can configure the
      <i>default</i> behaviour of a script by setting up its installationwide
      startup option file. All script users are free then to completely forget
      every already configured setup option. And if one of them regularly adds
      certain options to every call, he could store them in his
      <i>individual</i> startup option file.
    <p class="Pp">For example, I use this feature to make my scripts both
        flexible <i>and</i> usable. I have several scripts accessing a database
        via DBI. The database account parameters as well as the DBI startup
        settings should not be coded inside the scripts because this is not very
        flexible, so I implemented them by options. But on the other hand, there
        should be no need for a normal user to pass all these settings to every
        script call. My solution for this is to use <i>default</i> option files
        set up and maintained by an administrator. This is very transparent,
        most of the users know nothing of these (documented ;-) configuration
        settings ... and if anything changes, only the option files have to be
        adapted.</p>

No symbol is exported by default, but you may explicitly import the
  &quot;<b>argvFile()</b>&quot; function <i>using the exact syntax of the
  following example</i>:
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  use Getopt::ArgvFile qw(argvFile);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Please note that this interface is provided for backwards
    compatibility with versions up to 1.06. By loading the module this way, the
    traditional import mechanisms take affect and
    <i></i><i>&quot;argvFile()&quot;</i><i> is not called implicitly</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">This means that while option file hints are usually processed
    implicitly when <span class="Li">&quot;Getopt::ArgvFile&quot;</span> is
    loaded, the syntax</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  use Getopt::ArgvFile qw(argvFile);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">requires an <i>extra</i> call of
    <i></i><b><i>argvFile()</i></b><i></i> to process option files.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="FUNCTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#FUNCTIONS">FUNCTIONS</a></h1>
There is only one function, <i></i><b><i>argvFile()</i></b><i></i>, which does
  all the work of option file hint processing.
<p class="Pp">Please note that with version 1.07 and above
    <span class="Li">&quot;argvFile()&quot;</span> is called <i>implicitly</i>
    when the module is loaded, except this is done in one of the following
  ways:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  # the traditional interface - provided for
  # backwards compatibility - this loads the
  # module and imports the &amp;argvFile symbol
  use Getopt::ArgvFile qw(argvFile);

  --

  # option file processing is explicitly suppressed
  use Getopt::ArgvFile justload=&gt;1;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Except for the traditional loading, the complete interface of
    <span class="Li">&quot;argvFile()&quot;</span> is available via
    <span class="Li">&quot;use&quot;</span>, but in the typical
    <span class="Li">&quot;use&quot;</span> syntax without parantheses.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  # implicit call of argvFile(default=&gt;1, home=&gt;1)
  use Getopt::ArgvFile default=&gt;1, home=&gt;1;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">See <i>ONE LINE INVOCATION</i> for further details.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="_fBargvFile()_fP"><a class="permalink" href="#_fBargvFile()_fP"><b>argvFile()</b></a></h2>
Scans the command line parameters (stored in <span class="Li">@ARGV</span> or an
  alternatively passed array) for option file hints (see <i>Basics</i> below),
  reads the pointed files and makes their contents part of the source array
  (@ARGV by default) replacing the hints.
<p class="Pp">Because the function was intentionally designed to work on
    <span class="Li">@ARGV</span> and this is still the default behaviour, this
    manual mostly speaks about <span class="Li">@ARGV</span>. Please note that
    it is possible to process <i>any</i> other array as well.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Basics</b></p>
<p class="Pp">An option file hint is simply the filename preceeded by (at least)
    one &quot;@&quot; character:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  &gt; script -optA argA -optB @optionFile -optC argC
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This will cause <b>argvFile()</b> to scan &quot;optionFile&quot;
    for options. The element &quot;@optionFile&quot; will be removed from the
    <span class="Li">@ARGV</span> array and will be replaced by the options
    found.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note: you can choose another prefix by using the
    &quot;prefix&quot; parameter, see below.</p>
<p class="Pp">An option file which cannot be found is quietly skipped.</p>
<p class="Pp">Well, what is <i>within</i> an option file? It is intended to
    store <i>command line arguments</i> which should be passed to the called
    script. They can be stored exactly as they would be written in the command
    line, but may be spread to multiple lines. To make the file more readable,
    space and comment lines (starting with a &quot;#&quot;) are allowed
    additionally. POD comments are supported as well. For example, the call</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  &gt; script -optA argA -optB -optC cArg par1 par2
</pre>
<p class="Pp">could be transformed into</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  &gt; script @scriptOptions par1 par2
</pre>
<p class="Pp">where the file &quot;scriptOptions&quot; may look like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  # option a
  -optA argA
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;&quot;</span></p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  =pod
  option b
  =cut
  -optB
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;&quot;</span></p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  # option c
  -optC cArg
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><b>Nested option files</b></p>
<p class="Pp">Option files can be nested. Recursion is avoided globally, that
    means that every file will be opened only <i>once</i> (the first time
    <b>argvFile()</b> finds a hint pointing to it). This is the simplest
    implementation, indeed, but should be suitable. (Unfortunately, there are
    <i>LIMITS</i>.)</p>
<p class="Pp">By using this feature, you may combine groups of typical options
    into a top level option file, e.g.:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  File ab:
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;&quot;</span></p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  # option a
  -optA argA
  # option b
  -optB
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;&quot;</span></p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  File c:
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;&quot;</span></p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  # option c
  -optC cArg
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;&quot;</span></p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  File abc:
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;&quot;</span></p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  # combine ab and c
  @ab @c
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If anyone provides these files, a user can use a very short
  call:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  &gt; script @abc
</pre>
<p class="Pp">and <b>argvFile()</b> will recursively move all the filed program
    parameters into <span class="Li">@ARGV</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Relative pathes</b></p>
<p class="Pp">Pathes in option files might be relative, as in</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  -file ../file @../../configs/nested
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If written with the (prepared) start directory in mind, that will
    work, but it can fail when it was written relatively to the option file
    location because by default those pathes will not be resolved when written
    from an option file.</p>
<p class="Pp">Use parameter
    <span class="Li">&quot;resolveRelativePathes&quot;</span> to switch to path
    resolution:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
   argvFile(resolveRelativePathes=&gt;1);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">will cause <span class="Li">&quot;argvFile()&quot;</span> to
    expand those pathes, both in standard strings and nested option files.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
   With resolveRelativePathes, both pathes
   will be resolved:

   -file ../file @../../configs/nested
</pre>
<p class="Pp">A path is resolved <i>relative to the option file</i> it is found
    in.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Environment variables</b></p>
<p class="Pp">Similar to relative pathes, environment variables are handled
    differently depending if the option is specified at the commandline or from
    an option file, due to bypassed shell processing. By default,
    <span class="Li">&quot;argvFile()&quot;</span> does not resolve environment
    variables. But if required it can be commanded to do so via parameter
    <span class="Li">&quot;resolveEnvVars&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  argvFile(resolveEnvVars=&gt;1);
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><b>Startup support</b></p>
<p class="Pp">By setting several named parameters, you can enable automatic
    processing of <i>startup option files</i>. There are three of them:</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>default option file</i> is searched in the installation
    path of the calling script, the <i>home option file</i> is searched in the
    users home (evaluated via environment variable &quot;HOME&quot;), and the
    <i>current option script</i> is searched in the current directory.</p>
<p class="Pp">By default, all startup option files are expected to be named like
    the script, preceeded by a dot, but this can be adapted to individual needs
    if preferred, see below.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
 Examples:
  If a script located in &quot;/path/script&quot; is invoked in directory
  /the/current/dir by a user &quot;user&quot; whoms &quot;HOME&quot; variable points
  to &quot;/homes/user&quot;, the following happens:
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;&quot;</span></p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  argvFile()                    # ignores all startup option files;
  argvFile(default=&gt;1)          # searches and expands &quot;/path/.script&quot;,
                                # if available (the &quot;default&quot; settings);
  argvFile(home=&gt;1)             # searches and expands &quot;/homes/user/.script&quot;,
                                # if available (the &quot;home&quot; settings);
  argvFile(current=&gt;1)          # searches and expands &quot;/the/current/dir/.script&quot;,
                                # if available (the &quot;current&quot; settings);
  argvFile(
           default =&gt; 1,
           home    =&gt; 1,
           current =&gt; 1
          )                     # tries to handle all startups.
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Any true value will activate the setting it is assigned to.</p>
<p class="Pp">In case the &quot;.script&quot; name rule does not meet your needs
    or does not fit into a certain policy, the expected startup filenames can be
    set up by an option <span class="Li">&quot;startupFilename&quot;</span>. The
    option value may be a scalar used as the expected filename, or a reference
    to an array of accepted choices, or a reference to code returning the name -
    plainly or as a reference to an array of names. Such callback code will be
    called <i>once</i> and will receive the name of the script.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  # use &quot;.config&quot;
  argvFile(startupFilename =&gt; '.config');

  # use &quot;.config&quot; or &quot;config&quot;
  argvFile(startupFilename =&gt; [qw(.config config)]);

  # emulate the default behaviour,
  # but use an extra dot postfix
  my $nameBuilder=sub {join('', '.', basename($_[0]), '.');};
  argvFile(startupFilename =&gt; $nameBuilder);

  # use .(script)rc or .(script)/config
  my $nameBuilder=sub
                   {
                    my $sname=basename($_[0]);
                    [&quot;.${sname}rc&quot;, &quot;.${sname}/config&quot;];
                   };
  argvFile(startupFilename =&gt; $nameBuilder);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Note that the list variants will use the first matching filename
    in each possible startup-file path. For example if your array is
    <span class="Li">&quot;['.scriptrc',</span>
    <span class="Li">'.script.config']&quot;</span> and you have both a
    <span class="Li">&quot;.scriptrc&quot;</span> and a
    <span class="Li">&quot;.script.config&quot;</span> file in (say) your
    current directory, only the <span class="Li">&quot;.scriptrc&quot;</span>
    file will be used, as it is the first found.</p>
<p class="Pp">The contents found in a startup file is placed <i>before</i> all
    explicitly set command line arguments. This enables to overwrite a default
    setting by an explicit option. If all startup files are read, <i>current</i>
    startup files can overwrite <i>home</i> files which have preceedence over
    <i>default</i> ones, so that the <i>default</i> startups are most common. In
    other words, if the module would not support startup files, you could get
    the same result with &quot;script @/path/.script @/homes/user/.script
    @/the/current/dir/.script&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note: There is one certain case when overwriting will <i>not</i>
    work completely because duplicates are sorted out: if all three types of
    startup files are used and the script is started in the installation
    directory, the default file will be identical to the current file. The
    default file is processed, but the current file is skipped as a duplicate
    later on and will <i>not</i> overwrite settings made caused by the
    intermediately processed home file. If started in another directory, it
    <i>will</i> overwrite the home settings. But the alternative seems to be
    even more confusing: the script would behave differently if just started in
    its installation path. Because a user might be more aware of configuration
    editing then of the current path, I choose the current implementation, but
    this preceedence might become configurable in a future version.</p>
<p class="Pp">If there is no <i>HOME</i> environment variable, the <i>home</i>
    setting takes no effect to avoid trouble accessing the root directory.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Cascades</b></p>
<p class="Pp">The function supports multi-level (or so called <i>cascaded</i>)
    option files. If a filename in an option file hint starts with a
    &quot;@&quot; again, this complete name is the resolution written back to
    <span class="Li">@ARGV</span> - assuming there will be another utility
    reading option files.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
 Examples:
  @rfile          rfile will be opened, its contents is
                  made part of @ARGV.
  @@rfile         cascade: &quot;@rfile&quot; is written back to
                  @ARGV assuming that there is a subsequent
                  tool called by the script to which this
                  hint will be passed to solve it by an own
                  call of argvFile().
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The number of cascaded hints is unlimited.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Processing an alternative array</b></p>
<p class="Pp">Although the function was designed to process
    <span class="Li">@ARGV</span>, it is possible to process another array as
    well if you prefer. To do this, simply pass a <i>reference</i> to this array
    by parameter <b>array</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
 Examples:
  argvFile()                    # processes @ARGV;
  argvFile(array=&gt;\@options);   # processes @options;
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><b>Choosing an alternative hint prefix</b></p>
<p class="Pp">By default, &quot;@&quot; is the prefix used to mark an option
    file. This can be changed by using the optional parameter <b>prefix</b>:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
 Examples:
  argvFile();                   # use &quot;@&quot;;
  argvFile(prefix=&gt;'~');        # use &quot;~&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Note that the strings &quot;#&quot;, &quot;=&quot;, &quot;-&quot;
    and &quot;+&quot; are reserved and <i>cannot</i> be chosen here because they
    are used to start plain or POD comments or are typically option
  prefixes.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Using an option instead of a hint prefix</b></p>
<p class="Pp">People not familiar with option files might be confused by file
    prefixes. This can be avoided by offering an <i>option</i> that can be used
    instead of a prefix, using the optional parameter <b>fileOption</b>:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  # install a file option
  # (all lines are equivalent)
  argvFile(fileOption=&gt;'options');
  argvFile(fileOption=&gt;'-options');
  argvFile(fileOption=&gt;'+options');
  argvFile(fileOption=&gt;'--options');
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The name of the option can be specified with or without the usual
    option prefixes <span class="Li">&quot;-&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;--&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;+&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Once an option is declared, it <i>can</i> replace a prefix.
    (Prefixes remain in action as well.)</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
   # with -options declared to be a file option,
   # these sequences are equivalent
   @file
   -options file

   # five equivalent cascades
   @@@@file
   -options @@@file
   -options -options @@file
   -options -options -options @file
   -options -options -options -options file
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Please note that prefixes are attached to the filename with no
    spaces in between, while the option declared via -fileOption is separated
    from the filename by whitespace, as for normal options.</p>

If a script calling <span class="Li">&quot;argvFile()&quot;</span> with the
  <span class="Li">&quot;default&quot;</span> switch is invoked using a relative
  path, it is strongly recommended to perform the call of
  <span class="Li">&quot;argvFile()&quot;</span> in the startup directory
  because <span class="Li">&quot;argvFile()&quot;</span> then uses the
  <i>relative</i> script path as well.

If an option file does not exist, <b>argvFile()</b> simply ignores it. No
  message will be displayed, no special return code will be set.
