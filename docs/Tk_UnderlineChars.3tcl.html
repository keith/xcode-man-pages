   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

  	# Set up traps and other miscellaneous stuff for Tcl/Tk man pages.
  	# Start an argument description
  .b
  	# define tabbing values for .AP
  
  	# BS - start boxed text
  	# ^y = starting y location
  	# ^b = 1
  	# BE - end boxed text (draw box now)
  	Draw four-sided box normally, but don't draw top of
  	box if the box started on an earlier page.
  	# VS - start vertical sidebar
  	# ^Y = starting y location
  	# ^v = 1 (for troff;  for nroff this doesn't matter)
  	# VE - end of vertical sidebar
  	# Special macro to handle page bottom:  finish off current
  	# box/sidebar if in box/sidebar mode, then invoked standard
  	# page bottom macro.
  	Draw three-sided box if this is the box's first page,
  	draw two sides but no top otherwise.

  <dt>const char <i>*string</i> (in)</dt>
  <dd>Text to be measured or displayed. Need not be null terminated. Any

      other control characters) will be measured or displayed in a
      platform-dependent manner.</dd>
  <dt>int <i>numBytes</i> (in)</dt>
  <dd>The maximum number of bytes to consider when measuring or drawing
      <i>string</i>. Must be greater than or equal to 0.</dd>
  <dt>int <i>maxPixels</i> (in)</dt>
  <dd>If <i>maxPixels</i> is &gt;= 0, it specifies the longest permissible line
      length in pixels. Characters from <i>string</i> are processed only until
      this many pixels have been covered. If <i>maxPixels</i> is &lt; 0, then
      the line length is unbounded and the <i>flags</i> argument is
    ignored.</dd>
  <dt>int <i>flags</i> (in)</dt>
  <dd>Various flag bits OR-ed together: <b>TK_PARTIAL_OK</b> means include a
      character as long as any part of it fits in the length given by
      <i>maxPixels</i>; otherwise, a character must fit completely to be
      considered. <b>TK_WHOLE_WORDS</b> means stop on a word boundary, if
      possible. If <b>TK_AT_LEAST_ONE</b> is set, it means return at least one
      character even if no characters could fit in the length given by
      <i>maxPixels</i>. If <b>TK_AT_LEAST_ONE</b> is set and
      <b>TK_WHOLE_WORDS</b> is also set, it means that if not even one word fits
      on the line, return the first few letters of the word that did fit; if not
      even one letter of the word fit, then the first letter will still be
      returned.</dd>

These routines are for measuring and displaying simple single-font, single-line
  strings. To measure and display single-font, multi-line, justified text, refer
  to the documentation for <b>Tk_ComputeTextLayout</b>. There is no programming
  interface in the core of Tk that supports multi-font, multi-line text; support
  for that behavior must be built on top of simpler layers. Note that the
  interfaces described here are byte-oriented not character-oriented, so index
  values coming from Tcl scripts need to be converted to byte offsets using the
  <b>Tcl_UtfAtIndex</b> and related routines.
<p class="Pp">A glyph is the displayable picture of a letter, number, or some
    other symbol. Not all character codes in a given font have a glyph.
    Characters such as tabs, newlines/returns, and control characters that have
    no glyph are measured and displayed by these procedures in a
    platform-dependent manner; under X, they are replaced with backslashed
    escape sequences, while under Windows and Macintosh hollow or solid boxes
    may be substituted. Refer to the documentation for
    <b>Tk_ComputeTextLayout</b> for a programming interface that supports the
    platform-independent expansion of tab characters into columns and
    newlines/returns into multi-line text.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tk_MeasureChars</b> is used both to compute the length of a
    given string and to compute how many characters from a string fit in a given
    amount of space. The return value is the number of bytes from <i>string</i>
    that fit in the space specified by <i>maxPixels</i> subject to the
    conditions described by <i>flags</i>. If all characters fit, the return
    value will be <i>numBytes</i>. <i>*lengthPtr</i> is filled with the computed
    width, in pixels, of the portion of the string that was measured. For
    example, if the return value is 5, then <i>*lengthPtr</i> is filled with the
    distance between the left edge of <i>string</i>[0] and the right edge of
    <i>string</i>[4].</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tk_TextWidth</b> is a wrapper function that provides a simpler
    interface to the <b>Tk_MeasureChars</b> function. The return value is how
    much space in pixels the given <i>string</i> needs.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tk_DrawChars</b> draws the <i>string</i> at the given location
    in the given <i>drawable</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tk_UnderlineChars</b> underlines the given range of characters
    in the given <i>string</i>. It does not draw the characters (which are
    assumed to have been displayed previously by <b>Tk_DrawChars</b>); it just
    draws the underline. This procedure is used to underline a few characters
    without having to construct an underlined font. To produce natively
    underlined text, the appropriate underlined font should be constructed and
    used.</p>
