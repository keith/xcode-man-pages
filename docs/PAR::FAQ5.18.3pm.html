<h2 class="Ss" id="Where_is_the_Windows_binary_version?"><a class="permalink" href="#Where_is_the_Windows_binary_version?">Where
  is the Windows binary version?</a></h2>
You can find windows binaries here:
<p class="Pp">&lt;http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/S/SM/SMUELLER/&gt;</p>
<p class="Pp">There are three ways to install them. Sorted in order of
    preference:</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>cpan</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Run the <i>cpan</i> command line tool that comes with Perl. In the
    <i>cpan</i> shell, type</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  install PAR
</pre>
<p class="Pp">and wait for the script to download and extract PAR and its
    dependencies. If you have a C compiler installed, PAR will be built on your
    computer for your specific version of Perl. If you do not have a C compiler,
    the installer will look at the site referenced above for a compatible binary
    release and ask you whether you would like to install it.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>ppm</i></p>
<p class="Pp">If you are using ActivePerl from ActiveState, you can use the
    'ppm' program that comes with the ActiveState Perl. Instructions can be
    found below. PAR is availlable from various PPM repositories and some
    packages are compatible with some versions of ActivePerl and not with
    others. There is an incomplete PAR-Win32 Binary Compatibility List at
    &lt;http://par.wikia.com/wiki/PAR_PPM_Compatibility_List&gt; There are at
    least three relevant PPM repositories: The default ActiveState one, the
    bribes repository which is used in the example below and Randy Kobes'
    repository at &lt;http://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/ppms/&gt;.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    C:\&gt; ppm3
    # activestate was out of date compared to this one
    % rep add bribes http://www.bribes.org/perl/ppm
    # move it to first place on list of repositories
    % rep up bribes
    CPAN&gt;upgrade -install PAR
</pre>
<p class="Pp">And finally, 'q' to quit and that's all :-) You have access to pp
    and so on...</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>manual</i></p>
<p class="Pp">For reference, here's the old explanation of how to install it by
    hand: The file you need will be called
    PAR-X.XX-MSWin32-x86-multi-thread-Y.Y.Y.par where X.XX is the version of PAR
    you will use and Y.Y.Y is the version of Perl you have. Unzip this file (you
    may need to rename it to end with .zip instead of .par first) and copy all
    the files in the script directory into a directory in your PATH. Now you
    should be able to use PAR.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Can__s-1PAR_s0_bundle_all_its_prerequisites?"><a class="permalink" href="#Can__s-1PAR_s0_bundle_all_its_prerequisites?">Can
  PAR bundle all its prerequisites?</a></h2>
<i>Note:</i> This entry needs serious attention.
<p class="Pp">Yes and no.</p>
<p class="Pp">It would be possible to do this but it would also introduce a
    maintenance nightmare. A new version of PAR would have to be released
    whenever a new version of any of the dependencies came out. This is already
    painful with the included Module::Install.</p>
<p class="Pp">The original proposal which led to this FAQ entry considered the
    case where you want to install PAR without a working CPAN.pm/CPAN shell
    installation or without internet connectivity. By default, PAR will try to
    install its dependencies from CPAN using the CPAN.pm module.</p>
<p class="Pp">Given that you have a development machine with PAR installed and
    with a working CPAN.pm, it is reasonably simple to create one or more .par
    distributions of PAR's dependencies. Install PAR::Dist::FromCPAN. Then you
    can create .par distributions (read: binaries installable with the pure-perl
    PAR::Dist on the same architecture) for the PAR dependencies as follows:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  mkdir par_files
  cpan2par --pattern PAR --follow --out par_files/ --merge --skip File::.*
           --skip Getopt::Std --skip Carp --skip Data::Dumper --skip Time::Local
           --skip 'Test\b.*' --skip Text::ParseWords --skip ExtUtils::.*
           --skip Getopt::Long --skip Text::Abbrev --skip DirHandle --skip Pod::.*
</pre>
<p class="Pp">(Line breaks inserted for readability.) What happens here?
    cpan2par uses the API of the CPAN.pm module to fetch the PAR distribution
    from CPAN, unpacks it, builds it, creates a .par archive from its compiled
    state and then does the same for any of its dependencies. And then for its
    dependencies dependencies and... You get the idea. This is what the --follow
    option does. We add a couple of --skip options to skip core modules which we
    need not include and any Test::* modules. The --merge option merges all of
    the .par distributions into the original PAR one. Voila! (Future versions of
    PAR::Dist::FromCPAN might include an option --skip-core which would skip any
    modules contained in the core distribution.)</p>
<p class="Pp">After this command worked its magic, you should have a single file
    PAR-VERSION-ARCHNAME-PERLVERSION.par in the subdirectory 'par_files/'. You
    can now install PAR and its non-core dependencies on any machine that has
    the architecture of your development system (and a binary compatible perl
    version) using PAR::Dist as follows:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  perl -MPAR::Dist -einstall_par
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Provided that you run the command from within the directory
    containing the aforementioned .par file (and no other .par file).</p>
<p class="Pp">Since you might not even have PAR::Dist on the target machine, you
    can do this simple hack to get a basic installer:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  perl -MPAR::Dist -e'open my $fh, &quot;&lt;&quot;, $INC{&quot;PAR/Dist.pm&quot;}; print &lt;$fh&gt;;
       print &quot;\npackage main;\nPAR::Dist::install_par(\@ARGV ? shift(\@ARGV)
       : ());\n\n&quot;'
       &gt; installer.pl
</pre>
<p class="Pp">(Again: Line breaks inserted for readability.) This looks for your
    installed copy of PAR::Dist, reads it, writes it to STDOUT and appends two
    lines of code: &quot;package main;&quot; and a call to
    PAR::Dist::install_par. By default, it will install any (single) .par file
    in the current directory. If supplied with a file name as first argument, it
    will install the specified file. It should have no non-core dependencies! So
    shipping the generated PAR-....par file and the installer.pl file to the
    target machine and running &quot;perl installer.pl&quot; should just
    magically install PAR and its dependencies for you.</p>
<p class="Pp">Now, this whole trick works equally well for any other modules. In
    fact, if you have PAR on the target machine, you needn't even install the
    modules in the .par file in order to use them! You can just add &quot;use
    PAR 'foo-bar.par';&quot; to your code and any modules will be loaded from
    the .par file as necessary. (&quot;perl -MPAR=foo-bar.par
    your_script.pl&quot; works, too.) The documentation of the PAR module has
    details on this.</p>
<p class="Pp">Finally, note that you can install PAR::Repository::Client on the
    target machines and subsequently use PAR 0.951 and later to automatically
    fetch any unfulfilled dependencies from a (remote or local) repository:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  use PAR { repository =&gt; 'http://my_local_secure_host/repository' };
</pre>
<p class="Pp">or:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  use PAR { repository =&gt; 'file:///path/to/repository' };
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Details, again, in the PAR documentation and in the
    PAR::Repository::Client documentation.</p>

Unlike Perl2EXE, which can use a standard 16-color bitmap as an application
  icon, PAR requires a true Windows icon file. Download a trial version of
  Microangelo and use that to create your .ico file. The latest Netpbm tools at
  &lt;http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/&gt; has ppmtowinicon, which can tack a pbm
  and convert it to a windows icon. It is open source and has win32 ports.

As pointed out by Alan Stewart, zip adds a directory entry for the new
  directory, and it causes the PAR executable to fail. Just use :
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  zip -r -D hello.par my_dir/

In other words, &quot;I did a `pp foo.pl' and I lost foo.pl, how do I get it

<p class="Pp">The answer is to just use unzip/winzip/winrar/whatever to

  PAR completely hide my source code?</a></h2>
Not completely, but possible to a degree. Starting from version 0.76, PAR
  supports an input filter mechanism, which can be used to implement source
  obfuscators (or even product activation schemes).
<p class="Pp">But if you are looking for 100% bulletproof way of hiding source
    code, it is not possible with any language. Learning Perl, 3rd Edition has
    this answer to offer (quoted with permission from Randal Schwartz):</p>
<p class="Pp">If you're wishing for an opaque binary, though, we have to tell
    you that they don't exist. If someone can install and run your program, they
    can turn it back into source code. Granted, this won't necessarily be the
    same source that you started with, but it will be some kind of source code.
    The real way to keep your secret algorithm a secret is, alas, to apply the
    proper number of attorneys; they can write a license that says &quot;you can
    do this with the code, but you can't do that. And if you break our rules,
    we've got the proper number of attorneys to ensure that you'll regret
    it.&quot;</p>
<p class="Pp">Other than that, I would point you at PAR::Filter::Crypto. Be sure
    to read the CAVEATS and WARNINGS sections of the documentation.</p>

  Windows XP, pp crashes saying that &quot;par.exe has encountered a
  problem&quot;</a></h2>
This is believed to be fixed by PAR 0.76_99. The following answer applies to PAR
  0.76 and earlier:
<p class="Pp">You may be able to escape this problem by setting some executables
    to Windows 95 compatibility mode. Specifically, find &quot;parl.exe&quot;
    (probably in &quot;C:\perl\5.8.0\bin&quot;) using Windows Explorer, and
    right-click on it and choose &quot;Properties&quot;. Choose the
    &quot;Compatibility&quot; tab and tick the box for &quot;Run this program
    with compatibility mode for&quot; and check that the dropdown shows
    &quot;Windows 95&quot;. Then click OK.</p>
<p class="Pp">Now you can hopefully run pp as normal to generate an EXE. Before
    you can run the generated EXE, you'll need to set its compatibility mode
    too, in the same way as you did for parl.exe.</p>
<p class="Pp">This workaround is known not to work in all cases, and the
    developers are working on a solution to the problem. See these posts for
    more info:</p>

  Win32, a pp packed executable has trouble executing other perl scripts or pp
  packed executable</a></h2>
<i>Note:</i> Is this still current?
<p class="Pp">When running on a Win32 system, if a perl script is packed with pp
    and invokes another Perl script or pp packed executable, either with
    <i>system()</i> or backticks, the invoked program runs with the copy of
    perl5x.dll already loaded into memory. If the calling executable was packed
    with &quot;pp -d&quot;, the perl5x.dll is the one from the installed perl
    bin directory. Otherwise, it is the one packed with the executable. The
    perl5x.dll from the bin dir knows the <span class="Li">@INC</span> paths for
    the installed libraries; the one in the executable does not. Because of
    this, a program packed without &quot;-d&quot; calling a program with packed
    with &quot;-d&quot; or calling perl.exe to run a plain Perl script may fail.
    This is a Win32 limitation.</p>

  want to include a pp-ed binary in an RPM package. How can I make this
  work?</a></h2>
The binary executables outputted by pp (on Linux) are not valid ELF binaries
  because it basically attaches a zip archive to the binary loader and does not
  modify the ELF headers to reflect that. When building an RPM archive, the
  validity of the ELF headers is checked by default. This can result in problems
  when packaging pp-ed binaries in RPM archives.
<p class="Pp">Scott McBrien helped track down what can be done to get this to
    work:</p>

<pre>
  [I]t appears that the RPM archive that is generated gets a list of
  the MD5 sums for components of the executable file calculated by
  prelink.  By disabling prelink, it fixed the problem; in my RPM .spec
  file:
  %define         __prelink_undo_cmd     %{nil}
</pre>
<p class="Pp">After quite some time, it seems like the smart folks at Redhat
    found the culprit. I'm glad *they* did, because I wouldn't have:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  It appears that we found a solution that works. It like the pp
  executables are already stripped, so we don't want rpm stripping them
  again, which, of course, renders them useless.
  
  In this case, we added the following lines to the spec file to keep rpm
  from running the strip process and not produce debuginfo packages:
  
  %define __spec_install_post :
  %define debug_package %{nil}
  
  Don't forget to add the &quot;:&quot; character to __spec_install_post as above or
  this won't work.

The executables generated by pp generally contain a copy of your Perl shared
  libraries, the Perl core modules and any module dependencies your packaged
  application may have. That is a lot. Sometimes, PAR packages too much. It
  adheres to the philosophy of rather making the application work than
  generating a streamlined executable. If you want to optimize this, you will
  have to do so by excluding specific modules.
<p class="Pp">Chris Dolan's recent post to the PAR mailing list explains this
    well. Quoting Chris:
  (&lt;http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.par/2490&gt;)</p>

  I've found a few tricks that can help a lot:

  * If you know the target platform has Perl pre-installed (e.g. Mac OS X)
    then use the &quot;--dependent&quot; flag. This skips all of the core modules,
    yielding a much smaller executable.
    
    One significant caveat is moving to older systems.  For example,
    Mac OS X 10.2 had Perl 5.6.0 which has 146 fewer core modules than
    Perl 5.8.6 which shipped with Mac OS X 10.4, and (even more significantly)
    is binary-incompatible with any extra XS modules added from CPAN.
    Other platforms can be even harder to predict.
  
  * Watch for modules that pull in lots of dependencies
    
    A good example is DBI.  If your program uses DBI, then Module::ScanDeps
    pulls in ALL of the DBD::* modules (some of which are large) installed on
    your system, because it cannot realistically parse the DBI-&gt;connect()
    arguments which specify which database drivers are actually needed.
    In one of my MySQL-based applications, I use this invocation of PAR:
    
      pp -X DBD::SQLite -X DBD::CSV -X DBD::File -X DBD::Excel
    
    which saves quite a few bytes, because both DBD::SQLite and DBD::Excel
    have lots of CPAN dependencies.  The actual list if DBD::* modules you
    need to exclude depends on your system.  Here's a short command that will
    reveal all DBD::* modules on a unix-like system:
    
      perl -MModule::ScanDeps -le'print for map {&quot;DBD/&quot;.$_-&gt;{name}} Module::ScanDeps::_glob_in_inc(&quot;DBD&quot;)'
    
    Another smaller example is SOAP::Transport::* where most installations
    only need SOAP::Transport::HTTP.
    [...]

<p class="Pp">Similar techniques can be applied when a module makes use of
    Module::Pluggable for plugins.</p>
<p class="Pp">Finally, there is a PAR filter available as a separate
    distribution on CPAN which compresses the source code as much as possible by
    first parsing it using PPI and then spitting out a reduced functional
    equivalent: PAR::Filter::Squish.</p>

It is not possible to create stand-alone binaries for different platform than
  what you are currently running on. This is a generally hard problem since you
  would have to cross-compile all XS modules and perl itself. Not nice.
<p class="Pp">For example, if you would like to develop an application on Linux
    and ship it for both Linux/x86 and Win32/x86, it works well to set up a
    Virtual Machine with a Windows (XP or 2000 or whatever) and a Perl
    installation. On that machine, use PAR/pp to package your application for
    Win32.</p>

    what platforms will the resulting executable run?&quot;.</p>
