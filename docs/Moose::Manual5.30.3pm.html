   give a nicer C++.  Capital omega is used to do unbreakable dashes and

  IS MOOSE?</a></h1>
Moose is a <i>complete</i> object system for Perl 5. Consider any modern
  object-oriented language (which Perl 5 definitely isn't). It provides keywords
  for attribute declaration, object construction, inheritance, and maybe more.
  These keywords are part of the language, and you don't care how they are
  implemented.
<p class="Pp">Moose aims to do the same thing for Perl 5 OO. We can't actually
    create new keywords, but we do offer &quot;sugar&quot; that looks a lot like
    them. More importantly, with Moose, you <i>define your class</i>
    <i>declaratively</i>, without needing to know about blessed hashrefs,
    accessor methods, and so on.</p>
<p class="Pp">With Moose, you can concentrate on the <i>logical</i> structure of
    your classes, focusing on &quot;what&quot; rather than &quot;how&quot;. A
    class definition with Moose reads like a list of very concise English
    sentences.</p>
<p class="Pp">Moose is built on top of
    <span class="Li">&quot;Class::MOP&quot;</span>, a meta-object protocol (aka
    MOP). Using the MOP, Moose provides complete introspection for all
    Moose-using classes. This means you can ask classes about their attributes,
    parents, children, methods, etc., all using a well-defined API. The MOP
    abstracts away the symbol table, looking at <span class="Li">@ISA</span>
    vars, and all the other crufty Perl tricks we know and love(?).</p>
<p class="Pp">Moose is based in large part on the Perl 6 object system, as well
    as drawing on the best ideas from CLOS, Smalltalk, and many other
  languages.</p>

  MOOSE?</a></h1>
Moose makes Perl 5 OO both simpler and more powerful. It encapsulates Perl 5
  power tools in high-level declarative APIs which are easy to use. Best of all,
  you don't need to be a wizard to use it.
<p class="Pp">But if you want to dig about in the guts, Moose lets you do that
    too, by using and extending its powerful introspection API.</p>

  say $user-&gt;date_of_last_login;

<p class="Pp">We'll leave the line-by-line explanation of this code to other

    declarative constructs.</p>

  OF CONTENTS</a></h1>
This manual consists of a number of documents.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>Moose::Manual::Concepts</dt>
  <dd>Introduces Moose concepts, and contrasts them against &quot;old
      school&quot; Perl 5 OO.</dd>
  <dt>Moose::Manual::Unsweetened</dt>
  <dd>Shows two example classes, each written first with Moose and then with
      &quot;plain old Perl 5&quot;.</dd>
  <dt>Moose::Manual::Classes</dt>
  <dd>How do you make use of Moose in your classes? Now that I'm a Moose, how do
      I subclass something?</dd>
  <dt>Moose::Manual::Attributes</dt>
  <dd>Attributes are a core part of the Moose OO system. An attribute is a piece
      of data that an object has. Moose has a lot of attribute-related
    features!</dd>
  <dt>Moose::Manual::Delegation</dt>
  <dd>Delegation is a powerful way to make use of attributes which are
      themselves objects.</dd>
  <dt>Moose::Manual::Construction</dt>
  <dd>Learn how objects are built in Moose, and in particular about the
      <span class="Li">&quot;BUILD&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;BUILDARGS&quot;</span> methods. Also covers object
      destruction with <span class="Li">&quot;DEMOLISH&quot;</span>.</dd>
  <dt>Moose::Manual::MethodModifiers</dt>
  <dd>A method modifier lets you say &quot;before calling method X, do this
      first&quot;, or &quot;wrap method X in this code&quot;. Method modifiers
      are particularly handy in roles and with attribute accessors.</dd>
  <dt>Moose::Manual::Roles</dt>
  <dd>A role is something a class does (like &quot;Debuggable&quot; or
      &quot;Printable&quot;). Roles provide a way of adding behavior to classes
      that is orthogonal to inheritance.</dd>
  <dt>Moose::Manual::Types</dt>
  <dd>Moose's type system lets you strictly define what values an attribute can
      contain.</dd>
  <dt>Moose::Manual::MOP</dt>
  <dd>Moose's meta API system lets you ask classes about their parents,
      children, methods, attributes, etc.</dd>
  <dt>Moose::Manual::MooseX</dt>
  <dd>This document describes a few of the most useful Moose extensions on
    CPAN.</dd>
  <dt>Moose::Manual::BestPractices</dt>
  <dd>Moose has a lot of features, and there's definitely more than one way to
      do it. However, we think that picking a subset of these features and using
      them consistently makes everyone's life easier.</dd>
  <dt>Moose::Manual::FAQ</dt>
  <dd>Frequently asked questions about Moose.</dd>
  <dt>Moose::Manual::Resources</dt>
  <dd>Links to various tutorials, videos, blogs, presentations, interviews,
      etc...</dd>
  <dt>Moose::Manual::Contributing</dt>
  <dd>Interested in hacking on Moose? Read this.</dd>
  <dt>Moose::Manual::Delta</dt>
  <dd>This document details backwards-incompatibilities and other major changes
      to Moose.</dd>

<h1 class="Sh" id="JUSTIFICATION"><a class="permalink" href="#JUSTIFICATION">JUSTIFICATION</a></h1>
If you're still asking yourself &quot;Why do I need this?&quot;, then this
  section is for you.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>Another object system!?!?</dt>
  <dd>Yes, we know there are many, many ways to build objects in Perl 5, many of
      them based on inside-out objects and other such things. Moose is different
      because it is not a new object system for Perl 5, but instead an extension
      of the existing object system.
    <p class="Pp">Moose is built on top of Class::MOP, which is a metaclass
        system for Perl 5. This means that Moose not only makes building normal
        Perl 5 objects better, but it also provides the power of metaclass
        programming.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Is this for real? Or is this just an experiment?</dt>
  <dd>Moose is <i>based</i> on the prototypes and experiments Stevan did for the
      Perl 6 meta-model. However, Moose is <b>NOT</b> an experiment or
      prototype; it is for <b>real</b>.</dd>
  <dt>Is this ready for use in production?</dt>
  <dd>Yes.
    <p class="Pp">Moose has been used successfully in production environments by
        many people and companies. There are Moose applications which have been
        in production with little or no issue now for years. We consider it
        highly stable and we are committed to keeping it stable.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Of course, in the end, you need to make this call yourself. If
        you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to email Stevan or
        the moose@perl.org list, or just stop by irc.perl.org#moose and ask
        away.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Is Moose just Perl 6 in Perl 5?</dt>
  <dd>No. While Moose is very much inspired by Perl 6, it is not itself Perl 6.
      Instead, it is an OO system for Perl 5. Stevan built Moose because he was
      tired of writing the same old boring Perl 5 OO code, and drooling over
      Perl 6 OO. So instead of switching to Ruby, he wrote Moose :)</dd>
  <dt>Wait, <i>post</i> modern, I thought it was just <i>modern</i>?</dt>
  <dd>Stevan read Larry Wall's talk from the 1999 Linux World entitled
      &quot;Perl, the first postmodern computer language&quot; in which he talks
      about how he picked the features for Perl because he thought they were
      cool and he threw out the ones that he thought sucked. This got him
      thinking about how we have done the same thing in Moose. For Moose, we
      have &quot;borrowed&quot; features from Perl 6, CLOS (LISP), Smalltalk,
      Java, BETA, OCaml, Ruby and more, and the bits we didn't like (cause they
      sucked) we tossed aside. So for this reason (and a few others) Stevan has
      re-dubbed Moose a <i>postmodern</i> object system.
    <p class="Pp">Nuff Said.</p>
