<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>In-place operation means that the same texture is used both to hold the input
image and the results. Operating in-place can be an excellent way to reduce
resource utilization, and save time and energy. While simple Metal kernels can
not operate in place because textures can not be readable and writable at the
same time, some MPSKernels can operate in place because they use
multi-pass algorithms. Whether a MPSKernel can operate in-place can
depend on current hardware, operating system revision and the parameters
and properties passed to it. You should never assume that a MPSKernel will
continue to work in place, even if you have observed it doing so before.
</pre>
<p class="Pp">
  <br/>
   If the operation succeeds in-place, YES is returned. If the in-place
    operation fails and no copyAllocator is provided, then NO is returned. In
    neither case is the pointer held at *texture modified.</p>
<p class="Pp">Failure during in-place operation is common. You may find it
    simplifies your code to provide a copyAllocator. When an in-place filter
    fails, your copyAllocator will be invoked to create a new texture in which
    to write the results, allowing the filter to proceed reliably out-of-place.
    The original texture will be released, replaced with a pointer to the new
    texture and YES will be returned. If the allocator returns an invalid
    texture, it is released, *texture remains unmodified and NO is returned.
    Please see the MPSCopyAllocator definition for a sample allocator
    implementation.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note: Image filters that look at neighboring pixel values may
    actually consume more memory when operating in place than out of place. Many
    such operations are tiled internally to save intermediate texture storage,
    but can not tile when operating in place. The memory savings for tiling is
    however very short term, typically the lifetime of the MTLCommandBuffer.</p>
