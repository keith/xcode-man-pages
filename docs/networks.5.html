<p class="Pp">The <a class="Xr">networks</a> file contains information regarding
    the known networks which comprise the DARPA Internet. For each network a
    single line should be present with the following information:</p>
<div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent">
<pre>official network name
network number
aliases</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Items are separated by any number of blanks and/or tab characters.
    A ``#'' indicates the beginning of a comment; characters up to the end of
    the line are not interpreted by routines which search the file. This file is
    normally created from the official network data base maintained at the
    Network Information Control Center (NIC), though local changes may be
    required to bring it up to date regarding unofficial aliases and/or unknown
    networks.</p>
<p class="Pp">Network number may be specified in the conventional ``.'' (dot)
    notation using the <a class="Xr">inet_network(3)</a> routine from the
    Internet address manipulation library, <a class="Xr">inet(3)</a>. Network
    names may contain any printable character other than a field delimiter,
    newline, or comment character.</p>

<p class="Pp">Processes generally find network records using one of the
    <a class="Xr">getnetent(3)</a> family of functions. On Mac OS X, these
    functions interact with the <a class="Xr">DirectoryService(8)</a> daemon,
    which reads the /etc/networks file as well as searching other directory
    information services to determine network name and address information.</p>
