   Set up some character translations and predefined strings.  \*(-- will
   give an unbreakable dash, \*(PI will give pi, \*(L" will give a left
   double quote, and \*(R" will give a right double quote.  \*(C+ will
   give a nicer C++.  Capital omega is used to do unbreakable dashes and
   therefore won't be available.  \*(C` and \*(C' expand to `' in nroff,
   nothing in troff, for use with C<>.

Extremely similar to <b>open2()</b>, <b>open3()</b> spawns the given
  <span class="Li">$cmd</span> and connects CHLD_OUT for reading from the child,
  CHLD_IN for writing to the child, and CHLD_ERR for errors. If CHLD_ERR is
  false, or the same file descriptor as CHLD_OUT, then STDOUT and STDERR of the
  child are on the same filehandle (this means that an autovivified lexical
  cannot be used for the STDERR filehandle, see SYNOPSIS). The CHLD_IN will have
  autoflush turned on.
<p class="Pp">If CHLD_IN begins with
    <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;&amp;&quot;</span>, then CHLD_IN will be closed
    in the parent, and the child will read from it directly. If CHLD_OUT or
    CHLD_ERR begins with <span class="Li">&quot;&gt;&amp;&quot;</span>, then the
    child will send output directly to that filehandle. In both cases, there
    will be a <b>dup</b>(2) instead of a <b>pipe</b>(2) made.</p>
<p class="Pp">If either reader or writer is the null string, this will be
    replaced by an autogenerated filehandle. If so, you must pass a valid lvalue
    in the parameter slot so it can be overwritten in the caller, or an
    exception will be raised.</p>
<p class="Pp">The filehandles may also be integers, in which case they are
    understood as file descriptors.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>open3()</b> returns the process ID of the child process. It
    doesn't return on failure: it just raises an exception matching
    <span class="Li">&quot;/^open3:/&quot;</span>. However,
    <span class="Li">&quot;exec&quot;</span> failures in the child (such as no
    such file or permission denied), are just reported to CHLD_ERR under Windows
    and OS/2, as it is not possible to trap them.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the child process dies for any reason, the next write to
    CHLD_IN is likely to generate a SIGPIPE in the parent, which is fatal by
    default. So you may wish to handle this signal.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note if you specify <span class="Li">&quot;-&quot;</span> as the
    command, in an analogous fashion to <span class="Li">&quot;open(FOO,
    &quot;-|&quot;)&quot;</span> the child process will just be the forked Perl
    process rather than an external command. This feature isn't yet supported on
    Win32 platforms.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>open3()</b> does not wait for and reap the child process after
    it exits. Except for short programs where it's acceptable to let the
    operating system take care of this, you need to do this yourself. This is
    normally as simple as calling <span class="Li">&quot;waitpid $pid,
    0&quot;</span> when you're done with the process. Failing to do this can
    result in an accumulation of defunct or &quot;zombie&quot; processes. See
    &quot;waitpid&quot; in perlfunc for more information.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you try to read from the child's stdout writer and their stderr
    writer, you'll have problems with blocking, which means you'll want to use
    <b>select()</b> or the IO::Select, which means you'd best use
    <b>sysread()</b> instead of <b>readline()</b> for normal stuff.</p>
<p class="Pp">This is very dangerous, as you may block forever. It assumes it's
    going to talk to something like <b>bc</b>, both writing to it and reading
    from it. This is presumably safe because you &quot;know&quot; that commands
    like <b>bc</b> will read a line at a time and output a line at a time.
    Programs like <b>sort</b> that read their entire input stream first,
    however, are quite apt to cause deadlock.</p>
<p class="Pp">The big problem with this approach is that if you don't have
    control over source code being run in the child process, you can't control
    what it does with pipe buffering. Thus you can't just open a pipe to
    <span class="Li">&quot;cat -v&quot;</span> and continually read and write a
    line from it.</p>
