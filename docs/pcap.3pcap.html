<p class="Pp">The Packet Capture library provides a high level interface to
    packet capture systems. All packets on the network, even those destined for
    other hosts, are accessible through this mechanism. It also supports saving
    captured packets to a ``savefile'', and reading packets from a
  ``savefile''.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Opening_a_capture_handle_for_reading"><a class="permalink" href="#Opening_a_capture_handle_for_reading">Opening
  a capture handle for reading</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">To open a handle for a live capture, given the name of the network
    or other interface on which the capture should be done, call
    <b>pcap_create</b>(), set the appropriate options on the handle, and then
    activate it with <b>pcap_activate</b>().</p>
<p class="Pp">To obtain a list of devices that can be opened for a live capture,
    call <b>pcap_findalldevs</b>(); to free the list returned by
    <b>pcap_findalldevs</b>(), call <b>pcap_freealldevs</b>().
    <b>pcap_lookupdev</b>() will return the first device on that list that is
    not a ``loopback`` network interface.</p>
<p class="Pp">To open a handle for a ``savefile'' from which to read packets,
    given the pathname of the ``savefile'', call <b>pcap_open_offline</b>(); to
    set up a handle for a ``savefile'', given a <b>FILE&#x00A0;*</b> referring
    to a file already opened for reading, call <b>pcap_fopen_offline</b>().</p>
<p class="Pp">In order to get a ``fake'' <b>pcap_t</b> for use in routines that
    require a <b>pcap_t</b> as an argument, such as routines to open a
    ``savefile'' for writing and to compile a filter expression, call
    <b>pcap_open_dead</b>().</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>pcap_create</b>(), <b>pcap_open_offline</b>(),
    <b>pcap_fopen_offline</b>(), and <b>pcap_open_dead</b>() return a pointer to
    a <b>pcap_t</b>, which is the handle used for reading packets from the
    capture stream or the ``savefile'', and for finding out information about
    the capture stream or ``savefile''. To close a handle, use
    <b>pcap_close</b>().</p>
<p class="Pp">The options that can be set on a capture handle include</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="snapshot"><a class="permalink" href="#snapshot">snapshot
    length</a></dt>
  <dd>If, when capturing, you capture the entire contents of the packet, that
      requires more CPU time to copy the packet to your application, more disk
      and possibly network bandwidth to write the packet data to a file, and
      more disk space to save the packet. If you don't need the entire contents
      of the packet - for example, if you are only interested in the TCP headers
      of packets - you can set the &quot;snapshot length&quot; for the capture
      to an appropriate value. If the snapshot length is set to <i>snaplen</i>,
      and <i>snaplen</i> is less than the size of a packet that is captured,
      only the first <i>snaplen</i> bytes of that packet will be captured and
      provided as packet data.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>A snapshot length of 65535 should be sufficient, on most if not all
      networks, to capture all the data available from the packet.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>The snapshot length is set with <b>pcap_set_snaplen</b>().</dd>
  <dt id="promiscuous"><a class="permalink" href="#promiscuous">promiscuous
    mode</a></dt>
  <dd>On broadcast LANs such as Ethernet, if the network isn't switched, or if
      the adapter is connected to a &quot;mirror port&quot; on a switch to which
      all packets passing through the switch are sent, a network adapter
      receives all packets on the LAN, including unicast or multicast packets
      not sent to a network address that the network adapter isn't configured to
      recognize.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Normally, the adapter will discard those packets; however, many network
      adapters support &quot;promiscuous mode&quot;, which is a mode in which
      all packets, even if they are not sent to an address that the adapter
      recognizes, are provided to the host. This is useful for passively
      capturing traffic between two or more other hosts for analysis.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Note that even if an application does not set promiscuous mode, the
      adapter could well be in promiscuous mode for some other reason.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>For now, this doesn't work on the &quot;any&quot; device; if an argument
      of &quot;any&quot; or NULL is supplied, the setting of promiscuous mode is
      ignored.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Promiscuous mode is set with <b>pcap_set_promisc</b>().</dd>
  <dt id="monitor"><a class="permalink" href="#monitor">monitor mode</a></dt>
  <dd>On IEEE 802.11 wireless LANs, even if an adapter is in promiscuous mode,
      it will supply to the host only frames for the network with which it's
      associated. It might also supply only data frames, not management or
      control frames, and might not provide the 802.11 header or radio
      information pseudo-header for those frames.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>In &quot;monitor mode&quot;, sometimes also called &quot;rfmon mode&quot;
      (for &quot;Radio Frequency MONitor&quot;), the adapter will supply all
      frames that it receives, with 802.11 headers, and might supply a
      pseudo-header with radio information about the frame as well.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Note that in monitor mode the adapter might disassociate from the network
      with which it's associated, so that you will not be able to use any
      wireless networks with that adapter. This could prevent accessing files on
      a network server, or resolving host names or network addresses, if you are
      capturing in monitor mode and are not connected to another network with
      another adapter.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Monitor mode is set with <b>pcap_set_rfmon</b>(), and
      <b>pcap_can_set_rfmon</b>() can be used to determine whether an adapter
      can be put into monitor mode.</dd>
  <dt id="packet"><a class="permalink" href="#packet">packet buffer
    timeout</a></dt>
  <dd>If, when capturing, packets are delivered as soon as they arrive, the
      application capturing the packets will be woken up for each packet as it
      arrives, and might have to make one or more calls to the operating system
      to fetch each packet.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>If, instead, packets are not delivered as soon as they arrive, but are
      delivered after a short delay (called a &quot;packet buffer
      timeout&quot;), more than one packet can be accumulated before the packets
      are delivered, so that a single wakeup would be done for multiple packets,
      and each set of calls made to the operating system would supply multiple
      packets, rather than a single packet. This reduces the per-packet CPU
      overhead if packets are arriving at a high rate, increasing the number of
      packets per second that can be captured.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>The packet buffer timeout is required so that an application won't wait
      for the operating system's capture buffer to fill up before packets are
      delivered; if packets are arriving slowly, that wait could take an
      arbitrarily long period of time.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Not all platforms support a packet buffer timeout; on platforms that
      don't, the packet buffer timeout is ignored. A zero value for the timeout,
      on platforms that support a packet buffer timeout, will cause a read to
      wait forever to allow enough packets to arrive, with no timeout. A
      negative value is invalid; the result of setting the timeout to a negative
      value is unpredictable.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd><b>NOTE</b>: the packet buffer timeout cannot be used to cause calls that
      read packets to return within a limited period of time, because, on some
      platforms, the packet buffer timeout isn't supported, and, on other
      platforms, the timer doesn't start until at least one packet arrives. This
      means that the packet buffer timeout should <b>NOT</b> be used, for
      example, in an interactive application to allow the packet capture loop to
      ``poll'' for user input periodically, as there's no guarantee that a call
      reading packets will return after the timeout expires even if no packets
      have arrived.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>The packet buffer timeout is set with <b>pcap_set_timeout</b>().</dd>
  <dt id="immediate"><a class="permalink" href="#immediate">immediate
    mode</a></dt>
  <dd>In immediate mode, packets are always delivered as soon as they arrive,
      with no buffering. Immediate mode is set with
      <b>pcap_set_immediate_mode</b>().</dd>
  <dt id="buffer"><a class="permalink" href="#buffer">buffer size</a></dt>
  <dd>Packets that arrive for a capture are stored in a buffer, so that they do
      not have to be read by the application as soon as they arrive. On some
      platforms, the buffer's size can be set; a size that's too small could
      mean that, if too many packets are being captured and the snapshot length
      doesn't limit the amount of data that's buffered, packets could be dropped
      if the buffer fills up before the application can read packets from it,
      while a size that's too large could use more non-pageable operating system
      memory than is necessary to prevent packets from being dropped.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>The buffer size is set with <b>pcap_set_buffer_size</b>().</dd>
  <dt id="timestamp"><a class="permalink" href="#timestamp">timestamp
    type</a></dt>
  <dd>On some platforms, the time stamp given to packets on live captures can
      come from different sources that can have different resolutions or that
      can have different relationships to the time values for the current time
      supplied by routines on the native operating system. See
      <b>pcap-tstamp</b>(7) for a list of time stamp types.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>The time stamp type is set with <b>pcap_set_tstamp_type</b>().</dd>

<p class="Pp">Reading packets from a network interface may require that you have

  <dd>You must have read/write access to the network pseudo device, e.g.
      <i>/dev/le</i>. On at least some versions of Solaris, however, this is not
      sufficient to allow <i>tcpdump</i> to capture in promiscuous mode; on
      those versions of Solaris, you must be root, or the application capturing
      packets must be installed setuid to root, in order to capture in
      promiscuous mode. Note that, on many (perhaps all) interfaces, if you
      don't capture in promiscuous mode, you will not see any outgoing packets,
      so a capture not done in promiscuous mode may not be very useful.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>In newer versions of Solaris, you must have been given the
      <b>net_rawaccess</b> privilege; this is both necessary and sufficient to
      give you access to the network pseudo-device - there is no need to change
      the privileges on that device. A user can be given that privilege by, for
      example, adding that privilege to the user's <b>defaultpriv</b> key with

  <dt id="Under~6"><a class="permalink" href="#Under~6"><b>Under ULTRIX and

  <dd>Any user may capture network traffic. However, no user (not even the
      super-user) can capture in promiscuous mode on an interface unless the
      super-user has enabled promiscuous-mode operation on that interface using
      <i>pfconfig</i>(8), and no user (not even the super-user) can capture
      unicast traffic received by or sent by the machine on an interface unless
      the super-user has enabled copy-all-mode operation on that interface using
      <i>pfconfig</i>, so <i>useful</i> packet capture on an interface probably
      requires that either promiscuous-mode or copy-all-mode operation, or both
      modes of operation, be enabled on that interface.</dd>
  <dt id="Under~7"><a class="permalink" href="#Under~7"><b>Under BSD (this
    includes macOS):</b></a></dt>
  <dd>You must have read access to <i>/dev/bpf*</i> on systems that don't have a
      cloning BPF device, or to <i>/dev/bpf</i> on systems that do. On BSDs with
      a devfs (this includes macOS), this might involve more than just having
      somebody with super-user access setting the ownership or permissions on
      the BPF devices - it might involve configuring devfs to set the ownership
      or permissions every time the system is booted, if the system even

      other way to make that happen at boot time.</dd>

<p class="Pp">Reading a saved packet file doesn't require special

<p class="Pp">The packets read from the handle may include a ``pseudo-header''

<h2 class="Ss" id="Reading_packets"><a class="permalink" href="#Reading_packets">Reading
  packets</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Packets are read with <b>pcap_dispatch</b>() or
    <b>pcap_loop</b>(), which process one or more packets, calling a callback
    routine for each packet, or with <b>pcap_next</b>() or
    <b>pcap_next_ex</b>(), which return the next packet. The callback for
    <b>pcap_dispatch</b>() and <b>pcap_loop</b>() is supplied a pointer to a
    <i>struct pcap_pkthdr</i>, which includes the following members:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="ts"><a class="permalink" href="#ts"><b>ts</b></a></dt>
  <dd>a <i>struct timeval</i> containing the time when the packet was
    captured</dd>
  <dt id="caplen"><a class="permalink" href="#caplen"><b>caplen</b></a></dt>
  <dd>a <i>bpf_u_int32</i> giving the number of bytes of the packet that are
      available from the capture</dd>
  <dt id="len"><a class="permalink" href="#len"><b>len</b></a></dt>
  <dd>a <i>bpf_u_int32</i> giving the length of the packet, in bytes (which
      might be more than the number of bytes available from the capture, if the
      length of the packet is larger than the maximum number of bytes to
      capture).</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The callback is also supplied a <i>const u_char</i> pointer to the
    first <b>caplen</b> (as given in the <i>struct pcap_pkthdr</i> mentioned
    above) bytes of data from the packet. This won't necessarily be the entire
    packet; to capture the entire packet, you will have to provide a value for
    <i>snaplen</i> in your call to <b>pcap_set_snaplen</b>() that is
    sufficiently large to get all of the packet's data - a value of 65535 should
    be sufficient on most if not all networks). When reading from a
    ``savefile'', the snapshot length specified when the capture was performed
    will limit the amount of packet data available.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>pcap_next</b>() is passed an argument that points to a
    <i>struct pcap_pkthdr</i> structure, and fills it in with the time stamp and
    length values for the packet. It returns a <i>const u_char</i> to the first
    <b>caplen</b> bytes of the packet on success, and NULL on error.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>pcap_next_ex</b>() is passed two pointer arguments, one of
    which points to a <i>struct</i>pcap_pkthdr<i>*</i> and one of which points
    to a <i>const u_char</i>*. It sets the first pointer to point to a <i>struct
    pcap_pkthdr</i> structure with the time stamp and length values for the
    packet, and sets the second pointer to point to the first <b>caplen</b>
    bytes of the packet.</p>
<p class="Pp">To force the loop in <b>pcap_dispatch</b>() or <b>pcap_loop</b>()
    to terminate, call <b>pcap_breakloop</b>().</p>
<p class="Pp">By default, when reading packets from an interface opened for a
    live capture, <b>pcap_dispatch</b>(), <b>pcap_next</b>(), and
    <b>pcap_next_ex</b>() will, if no packets are currently available to be
    read, block waiting for packets to become available. On some, but <i>not</i>
    all, platforms, if a packet buffer timeout was specified, the wait will
    terminate after the packet buffer timeout expires; applications should be
    prepared for this, as it happens on some platforms, but should not rely on
    it, as it does not happen on other platforms. Note that the wait might, or
    might not, terminate even if no packets are available; applications should
    be prepared for this to happen, but must not rely on it happening.</p>
<p class="Pp">A handle can be put into ``non-blocking mode'', so that those
    routines will, rather than blocking, return an indication that no packets
    are available to read. Call <b>pcap_setnonblock</b>() to put a handle into
    non-blocking mode or to take it out of non-blocking mode; call
    <b>pcap_getnonblock</b>() to determine whether a handle is in non-blocking
    mode. Note that non-blocking mode does not work correctly in Mac OS X
  10.6.</p>
<p class="Pp">Non-blocking mode is often combined with routines such as
    <b>select</b>(2) or <b>poll</b>(2) or other routines a platform offers to
    wait for any of a set of descriptors to be ready to read. To obtain, for a
    handle, a descriptor that can be used in those routines, call
    <b>pcap_get_selectable_fd</b>(). If the routine indicates that data is
    available to read on the descriptor, an attempt should be made to read from
    the device.</p>
<p class="Pp">Not all handles have such a descriptor available;
    <b>pcap_get_selectable_fd</b>() will return <b>PCAP_ERROR</b> if no such
    descriptor is available. If no such descriptor is available, this may be
    because the device must be polled periodically for packets; in that case,
    <b>pcap_get_required_select_timeout</b>() will return a pointer to a
    <b>struct timeval</b> whose value can be used as a timeout in those
    routines. When the routine returns, an attmept should be made to read
    packets from the device. If <b>pcap_get_required_select_timeout</b>()
    returns NULL, no such timeout is available, and those routines cannot be
    used with the device.</p>
<p class="Pp">In addition, for various reasons, one or more of those routines
    will not work properly with the descriptor; the documentation for
    <b>pcap_get_selectable_fd</b>() gives details. Note that, just as an attempt
    to read packets from a <b>pcap_t</b> may not return any packets if the
    packet buffer timeout expires, a <b>select</b>(), <b>poll</b>(), or other
    such call may, if the packet buffer timeout expires, indicate that a
    descriptor is ready to read even if there are no packets available to
  read.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Filters"><a class="permalink" href="#Filters">Filters</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">In order to cause only certain packets to be returned when reading
    packets, a filter can be set on a handle. For a live capture, the filtering
    will be performed in kernel mode, if possible, to avoid copying
    ``uninteresting'' packets from the kernel to user mode.</p>
<p class="Pp">A filter can be specified as a text string; the syntax and
    semantics of the string are as described by <b>pcap-filter</b>(7). A filter
    string is compiled into a program in a pseudo-machine-language by
    <b>pcap_compile</b>() and the resulting program can be made a filter for a
    handle with <b>pcap_setfilter</b>(). The result of <b>pcap_compile</b>() can
    be freed with a call to <b>pcap_freecode</b>(). <b>pcap_compile</b>() may
    require a network mask for certain expressions in the filter string;
    <b>pcap_lookupnet</b>() can be used to find the network address and network
    mask for a given capture device.</p>
<p class="Pp">A compiled filter can also be applied directly to a packet that
    has been read using <b>pcap_offline_filter</b>().</p>
