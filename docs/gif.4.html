The <code class="Nm">gif</code> interface is a generic tunneling pseudo device
  for IPv4 and IPv6. It can tunnel IPv[46] traffic over IPv[46]. Therefore,
  there can be four possible configurations. The behavior of
  <code class="Nm">gif</code> is mainly based on RFC2893 IPv6-over-IPv4
  configured tunnel. On <span class="Ux">NetBSD</span>,
  <code class="Nm">gif</code> can also tunnel ISO traffic over IPv[46] using EON
  encapsulation.
<p class="Pp">Each <code class="Nm">gif</code> interface is created at runtime
    using interface cloning. This is most easily done with the
    <a class="Xr">ifconfig(8)</a> <code class="Cm">create</code> command or
    using the
    <var class="Va">gifconfig_</var>&#x27E8;<var class="Ar">interface</var>&#x27E9;
    variable in <a class="Xr">rc.conf(5)</a>.</p>
<p class="Pp">To use <code class="Nm">gif</code>, administrator needs to
    configure protocol and addresses used for the outer header. This can be done
    by using <a class="Xr">gifconfig(8)</a>, or
    <code class="Dv">SIOCSIFPHYADDR</code> ioctl. Also, administrator needs to
    configure protocol and addresses used for the inner header, by using
    <a class="Xr">ifconfig(8)</a>. Note that IPv6 link-local address (those
    start with <code class="Li">fe80::</code>) will be automatically configured
    whenever possible. You may need to remove IPv6 link-local address manually
    using <a class="Xr">ifconfig(8)</a>, when you would like to disable the use
    of IPv6 as inner header (like when you need pure IPv4-over-IPv6 tunnel).
    Finally, use routing table to route the packets toward
    <code class="Nm">gif</code> interface.</p>
<p class="Pp"><code class="Nm">gif</code> can be configured to be ECN friendly.
    This can be configured by <code class="Dv">IFF_LINK1</code>.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="ECN_friendly_behavior"><a class="permalink" href="#ECN_friendly_behavior">ECN

<code class="Nm">gif</code> can be configured to be ECN friendly, as described
  in <code class="Dv">draft-ietf-ipsec-ecn-02.txt</code>. This is turned off by
  default, and can be turned on by <code class="Dv">IFF_LINK1</code> interface
  flag.
<p class="Pp">Without <code class="Dv">IFF_LINK1</code>,
    <code class="Nm">gif</code> will show a normal behavior, like described in
    RFC2893. This can be summarized as follows:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>Ingress</dt>
  <dd>Set outer TOS bit to <code class="Dv">0</code>.</dd>
  <dt>Egress</dt>
  <dd>Drop outer TOS bit.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p class="Pp">With <code class="Dv">IFF_LINK1</code>,
    <code class="Nm">gif</code> will copy ECN bits (<code class="Dv">0x02</code>
    and <code class="Dv">0x01</code> on IPv4 TOS byte or IPv6 traffic class
    byte) on egress and ingress, as follows:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>Ingress</dt>
  <dd>Copy TOS bits except for ECN CE (masked with <code class="Dv">0xfe</code>)
      from inner to outer. Set ECN CE bit to <code class="Dv">0</code>.</dd>
  <dt>Egress</dt>
  <dd>Use inner TOS bits with some change. If outer ECN CE bit is
      <code class="Dv">1</code>, enable ECN CE bit on the inner.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Note that the ECN friendly behavior violates RFC2893. This should
    be used in mutual agreement with the peer.</p>

Malicious party may try to circumvent security filters by using tunnelled
  packets. For better protection, <code class="Nm">gif</code> performs martian
  filter and ingress filter against outer source address, on egress. Note that
  martian/ingress filters are no way complete. You may want to secure your node
  by using packet filters. Ingress filter can be turned off by
  <code class="Dv">IFF_LINK2</code> bit.

<h2 class="Ss" id="Miscellaneous"><a class="permalink" href="#Miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</a></h2>
By default, <code class="Nm">gif</code> tunnels may not be nested. This behavior
  may be modified at runtime by setting the <a class="Xr">sysctl(8)</a> variable
  <var class="Va">net.link.gif.max_nesting</var> to the desired level of
  nesting. Additionally, <code class="Nm">gif</code> tunnels are restricted to
  one per pair of end points. Parallel tunnels may be enabled by setting the
  <a class="Xr">sysctl(8)</a> variable
  <var class="Va">net.link.gif.parallel_tunnels</var> to 1.

The <code class="Nm">gif</code> device first appeared in WIDE hydrangea IPv6
  kit.

<h1 class="Sh" id="BUGS"><a class="permalink" href="#BUGS">BUGS</a></h1>
There are many tunneling protocol specifications, defined differently from each
  other. <code class="Nm">gif</code> may not interoperate with peers which are
  based on different specifications, and are picky about outer header fields.
  For example, you cannot usually use <code class="Nm">gif</code> to talk with
  IPsec devices that use IPsec tunnel mode.
<p class="Pp">The current code does not check if the ingress address (outer
    source address) configured to <code class="Nm">gif</code> makes sense. Make
    sure to configure an address which belongs to your node. Otherwise, your
    node will not be able to receive packets from the peer, and your node will
    generate packets with a spoofed source address.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the outer protocol is IPv4, <code class="Nm">gif</code> does
    not try to perform path MTU discovery for the encapsulated packet (DF bit is
    set to 0).</p>
<p class="Pp">If the outer protocol is IPv6, path MTU discovery for encapsulated
    packet may affect communication over the interface. The first
    bigger-than-pmtu packet may be lost. To avoid the problem, you may want to
    set the interface MTU for <code class="Nm">gif</code> to 1240 or smaller,
    when outer header is IPv6 and inner header is IPv4.</p>
<p class="Pp"><code class="Nm">gif</code> does not translate ICMP messages for
    outer header into inner header.</p>
<p class="Pp">In the past, <code class="Nm">gif</code> had a multi-destination
    behavior, configurable via <code class="Dv">IFF_LINK0</code> flag. The
    behavior was obsoleted and is no longer supported.</p>
<p class="Pp">It is thought that this is not actually a bug in gif, but rather
    lies somewhere around a manipulation of an IPv6 routing table.</p>
