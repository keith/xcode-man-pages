<p class="Pp">This utility is not meant for normal users or even sysadmins. It
    provides unabstracted access to capabilities which are normally handled for
    the user automatically when changing the security policy through GUIs such
    as the Startup Security Utility in macOS Recovery
    (&#x201C;recoveryOS&#x201D;). It is possible to make your system security
    much weaker and therefore easier to compromise using this tool. This tool is
    not to be used in production environments. It is possible to render your
    system unbootable with this tool. It should only be used to understand how
    the security of Apple Silicon Macs works. Use at your own risk!</p>
<p class="Pp"><code class="Nm">bputil</code> performs actions by calling the
    BootPolicy library. This modifies the security configuration of the system,
    which is stored in a file called the LocalPolicy. This file is digitally
    signed by the Secure Enclave Processor (SEP). The private key which is used
    to sign the LocalPolicy is protected by a separate key which is only
    accessible when a user has put in their password as part of a successful
    authentication. This is why this tool must either have a username and
    password specified on the command line, or via the interactive prompt.</p>
<p class="Pp">macOS 12 Monterey introduced a new concept of &#x201C;paired
    recoveryOS&#x201D;, and a new set of restrictions related to it. Every
    installation of macOS 12 has its own paired recoveryOS with matching version
    stored on the same APFS volume group. Installations of macOS 11 Big Sur are
    paired to a single recoveryOS stored on a separate APFS volume group called
    &#x201C;system recoveryOS&#x201D;.</p>
<p class="Pp">By design, the SEP application which is responsible for making
    changes to the LocalPolicy will inspect the boot state of the main
    Application Processor (AP), and the pairing status between the booted OS and
    the target LocalPolicy. It will only allow the below security-downgrading
    operations if it detects that the AP is in the intended boot state, and the
    OS pairing status is valid. When System Integrity Protection (SIP) was first
    introduced to Macs, it was decided that requiring a reboot to recoveryOS
    would provide intentional friction which would make it harder for malicious
    software to downgrade the system. That precedent is extended here to detect
    the special boot to recoveryOS via holding the power key at boot time. We
    refer to this as One True Recovery (1TR), and most of the below downgrade
    options will only work when booted into 1TR, not when called from normal
    macOS or any other OS environment. This helps ensure that only a
    physically-present user, not malicious software running in macOS, can
    permanently downgrade the security settings. The below CLI options specify
    what boot environments a downgrade can be performed from.</p>
<p class="Pp">The pairing restrictions are enforced as follows:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>- All installations of macOS 11 are paired to the system recoveryOS. If a
    macOS 11 installation is selected to boot by default, then the system
    recoveryOS will be booted by holding down the power key at boot time. The
    system recoveryOS can downgrade security settings of any macOS 11
    installations, but not any installations of macOS 12.</dt>
  <dd style="width: auto;">&#x00A0;</dd>
  <dt>- Every installation of macOS 12 is paired to a recoveryOS stored on the
    corresponding APFS volume group. If a macOS 12 installation is selected to
    boot by default, then its paired recoveryOS will be booted by holding down
    the power key at boot time. The paired recoveryOS can downgrade security
    settings for the paired macOS installation, but not any other macOS
    installation.</dt>
  <dd style="width: auto;">&#x00A0;</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The SEP-signed LocalPolicy is evaluated at boot time by iBoot.
    Configurations within the LocalPolicy change iBoot's behavior, such as
    whether it will require that all boot objects must be signed with metadata
    specific to the particular machine (a &#x201C;personalized&#x201D;
    signature, which is the default, and the always-required policy on iOS), or
    whether it will accept &#x201C;global&#x201D; signatures which are valid for
    all units of a specific hardware model. The LocalPolicy can also influence
    other boot or OS security behavior as described in the below options.</p>

    <p class="Pp">Changes security mode to Full Security. This option is
        mutually exclusive with all options below which cause security
        downgrades. Full Security is effectively a LocalPolicy which is in its
        default state, lacking all available security downgrades. Full Security
        also performs an online check at software install and upgrade time to
        ensure that only the latest version of software can be installed. This
        prevents accidentally installing old software which has known
        vulnerabilities in it. If the security is downgraded away from Full
        Security, and then re-upgraded to Full Security, the online check will
        be performed, and if the software is no longer the latest available, it
        will not be possible to set it to Full Security again. Because online
        checks are only performed at software installation, upgrade, and Full
        Security policy setting time, it is possible for an OS to report that it
        is Full Security despite not being the latest software version. Full
        Security only indicates the state as of the latest install or
      upgrade.</p>

  <dd>
    <p class="Pp">Selecting this option will make your system easier to
        compromise!</p>
    <p class="Pp">This changes the security mode to Reduced Security. Reduced
        Security will use the &#x201C;global&#x201D; digital signature for
        macOS, in order to allow running software which is not the latest
        version. Thus anything other than the latest software therefore may have
        security vulnerabilities. At a high level, Reduced Security does not
        necessarily require the latest software, but it does still require all
        software be digitally signed by Apple or 3rd party software developers.
        Passing this option will explicitly recreate the LocalPolicy from
        scratch, (i.e. it does not preserve any existing security policy
        options) and only the options specified via this tool will exist in the
        output local policy.</p>

  <dd>
    <p class="Pp">Selecting this option will make your system easier to

    <p class="Pp">This changes the security mode to Permissive Security.
        Permissive Security uses the same &#x201C;global&#x201D; digital
        signature for macOS as the above Reduced Security option, in order to
        allow running software which is not the latest version. Thus anything
        other than the latest software therefore may have security
        vulnerabilities. At a high level, Permissive Security allows
        configuration options to be set to not require all software to be
        digitally signed. This can allow users who are not part of the Apple
        Developer program to still be able to introduce their own software into
        their system. Additionally, especially dangerous security downgrades may
        be restricted to Permissive Security, and only available via CLI tools
        for power users rather than GUIs. Passing this option will explicitly
        recreate the LocalPolicy from scratch, (i.e. it does not preserve any
        existing security policy options) and only the options specified via
        this tool will exist in the output local policy.</p>

        kernel extensions can introduce architectural or implementation flaws
        into the kernel, which can lead to system compromise. In order to
        achieve iOS-like security properties, 3rd party kexts must be denied by
        default, and only loadable if the customer consciously opts in to
        lowering their security from 1TR.</p>

        actions such as using dynamic DTrace code hooks to profile kernel
        behavior or perform 3rd party kernel extension debugging. However, the
        lack of CTRR enforcement makes it much easier for an attacker to modify

        manipulate the data stored there in order to try to exploit programs.
