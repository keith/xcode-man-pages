   The definitions below are for supplemental macros used in Tcl/Tk
   manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget.  The
  	options follow on successive lines, in four columns separated
  	by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.

  	# Set up traps and other miscellaneous stuff for Tcl/Tk man pages.
  	# Start an argument description
  .b
  	# define tabbing values for .AP
  
  	# BS - start boxed text
  	# ^y = starting y location
  	# ^b = 1
  	# BE - end boxed text (draw box now)
  	Draw four-sided box normally, but don't draw top of
  	box if the box started on an earlier page.
  	# VS - start vertical sidebar
  	# ^Y = starting y location
  	# ^v = 1 (for troff;  for nroff this doesn't matter)
  	# VE - end of vertical sidebar
  	# Special macro to handle page bottom:  finish off current
  	# box/sidebar if in box/sidebar mode, then invoked standard
  	# page bottom macro.
  	Draw three-sided box if this is the box's first page,
  	draw two sides but no top otherwise.
  	# DS - begin display
  	# DE - end display
  	# SO - start of list of standard options
  	# SE - end of list of standard options
  	# OP - start of full description for a single option
  	# CS - begin code excerpt
  	# CE - end code excerpt

This package provides commands and objects for the generic management of plugins
  which can be loaded into an application.
<p class="Pp">To avoid the implementation of yet another system to locate Tcl
    code the system provides by this package is built on top of the regular
    package management system. Each plugin is considered as a package and a
    simple invokation of <b>package require</b> is enough to locate and load it,
    if it exists. The only time we will need additional paths is when a plugin
    manager is part of a wrapped application and has to be able to search for
    plugins existing outside of that application. For this situation the package
    provides a command to create a general set of such paths based on names for
    the plugin manager and/or application in question.</p>
<p class="Pp">The main contribution of this package is a generic framework which
    allows the easy declaration of</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>[1]</dt>
  <dd>How to translate a plugin name to the name of the package implementing it,
      and vice versa.</dd>
  <dt>[2]</dt>
  <dd>The list of commands a plugin has to provide as API, and also of more
      complex checks as code.</dd>
  <dt>[3]</dt>
  <dd>The list of commands expected by the plugin from the environment.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">This then allows the easy generation of plugin managers customized
    to particular types of plugins for an application.</p>
<p class="Pp">It should be noted that all plugin code is considered untrusted
    and will always be executed within a safe interpreter. The interpreter is
    enabled enough to allow plugins the loading of all additional packages they
    may need.</p>

All commands created by the command <b>::pluginmgr</b> (See section <b>PACKAGE
  COMMANDS</b>) have the following general form and may be used to invoke
  various operations on their plugin manager object.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>objectName</b> <b>method</b> ?<i>arg arg ...</i>?</dt>

<h2 class="Ss" id="OBJECT_METHODS"><a class="permalink" href="#OBJECT_METHODS">OBJECT
  METHODS</a></h2>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><i>objectName</i> <b>clone</b></dt>
  <dd>This method creates a new plugin management object and returns the
      associated object command. The generated object is a clone of the object
      the method was invoked on. I.e. the new object will have the same
      configuration as the current object. With regard to state, if the current
      object has a plugin loaded then this plugin and all associated state is
      moved to the generated clone and the current object is reset into the base
      state (no plugin loaded). In this manner a configured plugin manager is
      also a factory for loaded plugins.</dd>
  <dt><i>objectName</i> <b>configure</b></dt>
  <dd>The method returns a list of all known options and their current values
      when called without any arguments.</dd>
  <dt><i>objectName</i> <b>configure</b> <i>option</i></dt>
  <dd>The method behaves like the method <b>cget</b> when called with a single
      argument and returns the value of the option specified by said
    argument.</dd>
  <dt><i>objectName</i> <b>configure</b> <b>-option</b> <i>value</i>...</dt>
  <dd>The method reconfigures the specified <b>option</b>s of the object,
      setting them to the associated <i>value</i>s, when called with an even
      number of arguments, at least two.
    <p class="Pp">The legal options are described in the section <b>OBJECT
        CONFIGURATION</b>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><i>objectName</i> <b>cget</b> <b>-option</b></dt>
  <dd>This method expects a legal configuration option as argument and will
      return the current value of that option for the object the method was
      invoked for.
    <p class="Pp">The legal configuration options are described in section
        <b>OBJECT CONFIGURATION</b>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><i>objectName</i> <b>destroy</b></dt>
  <dd>This method destroys the object it is invoked for.</dd>
  <dt><i>objectName</i> <b>do</b> <i>arg</i>...</dt>
  <dd>This method interprets its list of arguments as the words of a command and
      invokes this command in the execution context of the plugin. The result of
      the invoked command is made the result of the method. The call will fail
      with an error if no valid plugin has been loaded into the manager
    object.</dd>
  <dt><i>objectName</i> <b>interpreter</b></dt>
  <dd>This method returns the handle of the safe interpreter the current plugin
      is loaded into. An empty string as return value signals that the manager
      currently has no valid plugin loaded.</dd>
  <dt><i>objectName</i> <b>plugin</b></dt>
  <dd>This method returns the name of the plugin currently loaded. An empty
      string as return value signals that the manager currently has no valid
      plugin loaded.</dd>
  <dt><i>objectName</i> <b>load</b> <i>string</i></dt>
  <dd>This method loads, validates, and initializes a named plugin into the
      manager object.
    <p class="Pp">The algorithm to locate and load the plugin employed is:</p>

</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">

  <dd>If the <i>string</i> contains the path to an existing file then this file
      is taken as the implementation of the plugin.</dd>

  <dd>Otherwise the plugin name is translated into a package name via the value
      of the option <b>-pattern</b> and then loaded through the regular package
      management.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><i>objectName</i> <b>unload</b></dt>

      string. The call will be silently ignored if no plugin is loaded at
    all.</dd>
  <dt><i>objectName</i> <b>list</b></dt>
  <dd>This method uses the contents of the option <b>-pattern</b> to find all
      packages which can be plugins under the purview of this manager object. It
      translates their names into plugin names and returns a list containing
      them.</dd>
  <dt><i>objectName</i> <b>path</b> <i>path</i></dt>
  <dd>This methods adds the specified <i>path</i> to the list of additional
      package paths to look at when searching for a plugin. It returns the empty
      string. Duplicate paths are ignored, i.e. each path is added only once.
      Paths are made absolute, but are not normalized.</dd>
  <dt><i>objectName</i> <b>paths</b></dt>
  <dd>This method returns a list containing all additional paths which have been
      added to the plugin manager object since its creation.</dd>
</dl>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="OBJECT_CONFIGURATION"><a class="permalink" href="#OBJECT_CONFIGURATION">OBJECT
  CONFIGURATION</a></h2>
All plugin manager objects understand the following configuration options:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>-pattern</b> <i>string</i></dt>
  <dd>The value of this option is a glob pattern which has to contain exactly
      one '*'-operator. All packages whose names match this pattern are the
      plugins recognized by the manager object. And vice versa, the replacement
      of the '*'-operator with a plugin name will yield the name of the package
      implementing that plugin.
    <p class="Pp">This option has no default, except if option <b>-name</b> was
        set. It has to be set before attempting to load a plugin, either
        directly, or through option <b>-name</b>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>-api</b> <i>list</i></dt>
  <dd>The value of this option is a list of command names, and any plugin loaded
      has to provide these commands. Names which are not fully qualified are
      considered to be rooted in the global namespace. If empty no expectations
      are made on the plugin. The default value is the empty list.</dd>
  <dt><b>-check</b> <i>cmdprefix</i></dt>
  <dd>The value of this option is interpreted as a command prefix. Its purpose
      is to perform complex checks on a loaded plugin package to validate it,
      which go beyond a simple list of provided commands.
    <p class="Pp">It is called with the manager object command as the only
        argument and has to return a boolean value. A value of <b>true</b> will
        be interpreted to mean that the candidate plugin passed the test. The
        call will happen if and only if the candidate plugin already passed the
        basic API check specified through the option <b>-api</b>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The default value is the empty list, which causes the manager
        object to suppress the call and to assume the candidate plugin
      passes.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>-cmds</b> <i>dict</i></dt>
  <dd>The value of this option is a dictionary. It specifies the commands which
      will be made available to the plugin (as keys), and the trusted commands
      in the environment which implement them (as values). The trusted commands
      will be executed in the interpreter specified by the option <b>-cmdip</b>.
      The default value is the empty dictionary.</dd>
  <dt><b>-cmdip</b> <i>ipspec</i></dt>
  <dd>The value of this option is the path of the interpreter where the trusted
      commands given to the plugin will be executed in. The default is the empty
      string, referring to the current interpreter.</dd>
  <dt><b>-setup</b> <i>cmdprefix</i></dt>
  <dd>The value of this option is interpreted as a command prefix.
    <p class="Pp">It is called whenever a new safe interpreter for a plugin has
        been created, but before a plugin is loaded. It is provided with the
        manager object command and the interpreter handle as its only arguments.
        Any return value will be ignored.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Its purpose is give a user of the plugin management the
        ability to define commands, packages, etc. a chosen plugin may need
        while being loaded.</p>
