<p class="Pp">The <code class="Nm">ping6</code> utility uses the ICMPv6
    protocol's mandatory ICMP6_ECHO_REQUEST datagram to elicit an
    ICMP6_ECHO_REPLY from a host or gateway. ICMP6_ECHO_REQUEST datagrams
    (``pings'') have an IPv6 header, and ICMPv6 header formatted as documented
    in RFC2463. The options are as follows:</p>

      option will suppress the behavior in the following two levels: when the
      option is specified once, the behavior will be disabled for unicast

<p class="Pp">When using <code class="Nm">ping6</code> for fault isolation, it
    should first be run on the local host, to verify that the local network
    interface is up and running. Then, hosts and gateways further and further
    away should be &#x201C;pinged&#x201D;. Round-trip times and packet loss
    statistics are computed. If duplicate packets are received, they are not
    included in the packet loss calculation, although the round trip time of
    these packets is used in calculating the round-trip time statistics. When
    the specified number of packets have been sent (and received) or if the
    program is terminated with a <code class="Dv">SIGINT</code>, a brief summary
    is displayed, showing the number of packets sent and received, and the
    minimum, mean, maximum, and standard deviation of the round-trip times.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <code class="Nm">ping6</code> receives a
    <code class="Dv">SIGINFO</code> (see the <code class="Cm">status</code>
    argument for <a class="Xr">stty(1)</a>) signal, the current number of
    packets sent and received, and the minimum, mean, maximum, and standard
    deviation of the round-trip times will be written to the standard output in
    the same format as the standard completion message.</p>
<p class="Pp">This program is intended for use in network testing, measurement
    and management. Because of the load it can impose on the network, it is
    unwise to use <code class="Nm">ping6</code> during normal operations or from
    automated scripts.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="DUPLICATE_AND_DAMAGED_PACKETS"><a class="permalink" href="#DUPLICATE_AND_DAMAGED_PACKETS">DUPLICATE
  AND DAMAGED PACKETS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The <code class="Nm">ping6</code> utility will report duplicate
    and damaged packets. Duplicate packets should never occur when pinging a
    unicast address, and seem to be caused by inappropriate link-level
    retransmissions. Duplicates may occur in many situations and are rarely (if
    ever) a good sign, although the presence of low levels of duplicates may not
    always be cause for alarm. Duplicates are expected when pinging a broadcast
    or multicast address, since they are not really duplicates but replies from
    different hosts to the same request.</p>
<p class="Pp">Damaged packets are obviously serious cause for alarm and often
    indicate broken hardware somewhere in the <code class="Nm">ping6</code>
    packet's path (in the network or in the hosts).</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="TRYING_DIFFERENT_DATA_PATTERNS"><a class="permalink" href="#TRYING_DIFFERENT_DATA_PATTERNS">TRYING
  DIFFERENT DATA PATTERNS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The (inter)network layer should never treat packets differently
    depending on the data contained in the data portion. Unfortunately,
    data-dependent problems have been known to sneak into networks and remain
    undetected for long periods of time. In many cases the particular pattern
    that will have problems is something that does not have sufficient
    &#x201C;transitions&#x201D;, such as all ones or all zeros, or a pattern
    right at the edge, such as almost all zeros. It is not necessarily enough to
    specify a data pattern of all zeros (for example) on the command line
    because the pattern that is of interest is at the data link level, and the
    relationship between what you type and what the controllers transmit can be
    complicated.</p>
<p class="Pp">This means that if you have a data-dependent problem you will
    probably have to do a lot of testing to find it. If you are lucky, you may
    manage to find a file that either cannot be sent across your network or that
    takes much longer to transfer than other similar length files. You can then
    examine this file for repeated patterns that you can test using the
    <code class="Fl">-p</code> option of <code class="Nm">ping6</code>.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="EXIT_STATUS"><a class="permalink" href="#EXIT_STATUS">EXIT

<p class="Pp">The <code class="Nm">ping6</code> utility returns 0 on success

<p class="Pp">The <code class="Nm">ping6</code> utility is intentionally
    separate from <a class="Xr">ping(8)</a>.</p>
<p class="Pp">There have been many discussions on why we separate
    <code class="Nm">ping6</code> and <a class="Xr">ping(8)</a>. Some people
    argued that it would be more convenient to uniform the ping command for both
    IPv4 and IPv6.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following are an answer to the request:</p>
<p class="Pp">From a developer's point of view: since the underling raw sockets
    API is totally different between IPv4 and IPv6, we would end up having two
    types of code base. There would actually be less benefit to uniform the two
    commands into a single command from the developer's standpoint.</p>
<p class="Pp">From an operator's point of view: unlike ordinary network
    applications like remote login tools, we are usually aware of address family
    when using network management tools. We do not just want to know the
    reachability to the host, but want to know the reachability to the host via
    a particular network protocol such as IPv6. Thus, even if we had a unified
    <a class="Xr">ping(8)</a> command for both IPv4 and IPv6, we would usually
    type a <code class="Fl">-6</code> or <code class="Fl">-4</code> option (or
    something like those) to specify the particular address family. This
    essentially means that we have two different commands.</p>
