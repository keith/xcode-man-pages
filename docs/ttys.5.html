<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The file <code class="Nm">ttys</code> contains information that is
    used by various routines to initialize and control the use of terminal
    special files. This information is read with the
    <a class="Xr">getttyent(3)</a> library routines. There is one line in the
    <code class="Nm">ttys</code> file per special device file. Fields are
    separated by tabs and/or spaces. Fields comprised of more than one word
    should be enclosed in double quotes (``&quot;''). Blank lines and comments
    may appear anywhere in the file; comments are delimited by hash marks
    (``#'') and new lines. Any unspecified fields will default to null.</p>
<p class="Pp">The first field is normally the name of the terminal special file
    as it is found in <span class="Pa">/dev</span>. However, it can be any
    arbitrary string when the associated command is not related to a tty.</p>
<p class="Pp">The second field of the file is the command to execute for the
    line, usually <a class="Xr">getty(8)</a>, which initializes and opens the
    line, setting the speed, waiting for a user name and executing the
    <a class="Xr">login(1)</a> program. It can be, however, any desired command,
    for example the start up for a window system terminal emulator or some other
    daemon process, and can contain multiple words if quoted.</p>
<p class="Pp">The third field is the type of terminal usually connected to that
    tty line, normally the one found in the <a class="Xr">termcap(5)</a> data
    base file. The environment variable <code class="Ev">TERM</code> is
    initialized with the value by either <a class="Xr">getty(8)</a> or
    <a class="Xr">login(1)</a>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The remaining fields set flags in the
    <var class="Fa">ty_status</var> entry (see <a class="Xr">getttyent(3)</a>),
    specify a window system process that <a class="Xr">launchd(8)</a> will
    maintain for the terminal line, optionally determine the type of tty
    (whether dialin, network or otherwise), or specify a tty group name that
    allows the login class database (see <a class="Xr">login.conf(5)</a>) to
    refer to many ttys as a group, to selectively allow or deny access or enable
    or disable accounting facilities for ttys as a group.</p>
<p class="Pp" id="before">As flag values, the strings ``on'' and ``off'' specify
    that <a class="Xr">launchd(8)</a> should (should not) execute the command
    given in the second field. ``onifconsole'' will cause this line to be
    enabled if and only if it is an active kernel console device (it is
    equivalent to ``on'' in this case). The flag ``onifexists'' will cause this
    line to be enabled if and only if the name exists. If the name starts with a
    ``/'', it will be considered an absolute path. Otherwise, it is considered a
    path relative to <span class="Pa">/dev</span>. The flag ``secure'' (if the
    console is enabled) allows users with a uid of 0 to login on this line. The
    flag ``dialup'' indicates that a tty entry describes a dialin line, and
    ``network'' is obsolete and does nothing. Either of these strings may also
    be specified in the terminal type field. The string ``window='' may be
    followed by a quoted command string which <a class="Xr">launchd(8)</a> will
    execute <a class="permalink" href="#before"><i class="Em">before</i></a>
    starting the command specified by the second field.</p>
<p class="Pp">The string ``group='' may be followed by a group name comprised of
    alphanumeric characters that can be used by <a class="Xr">login.conf(5)</a>
    to refer to many tty lines as a group to enable or disable access and
    accounting facilities. If no group is specified, then the tty becomes a
    member of the group &quot;none&quot;. For backwards compatibility, the
    ``group='' should appear last on the line, immediately before the optional
    comment.</p>
<p class="Pp">Both the second field and any command specified with ``window=''
    will be split into words and executed using <a class="Xr">execve(2)</a>.
    Words are separated by any combinations of tabs and spaces. Arguments
    containing whitespace should be enclosed in single quotes
    (<code class="Li">'</code>). Note that no shell-style globbing or other
    variable substitution occurs.</p>

  SEQUENCES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Numeric sequences of terminals can be represented in a more
    compact format. A matching pair of square bracket may enclose two numbers
    (the start and stop values), separated by a hyphen. The numbers are assumed
    to be decimal, unless prefixed with ``0x'', in which case they are
    interpreted as hexadecimal. The number of characters (not including any
    ``0x'') in the starting value gives the minimum width; sequence values are
    zero padded up to this width. Thus ``tty[00-07]'' represents the eight
    terminals ``tty00'' through ``tty07''.</p>
