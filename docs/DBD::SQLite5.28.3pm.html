SQLite is a public domain file-based relational database engine that you can
  find at &lt;https://www.sqlite.org/&gt;.
<p class="Pp"><b>DBD::SQLite</b> is a Perl DBI driver for SQLite, that includes
    the entire thing in the distribution. So in order to get a fast transaction
    capable RDBMS working for your perl project you simply have to install this
    module, and <b>nothing</b> else.</p>
<p class="Pp">SQLite supports the following features:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>Implements a large subset of SQL92</dt>
  <dd>See &lt;https://www.sqlite.org/lang.html&gt; for details.</dd>
  <dt>A complete DB in a single disk file</dt>
  <dd>Everything for your database is stored in a single disk file, making it
      easier to move things around than with DBD::CSV.</dd>
  <dt>Atomic commit and rollback</dt>
  <dd>Yes, <b>DBD::SQLite</b> is small and light, but it supports full
      transactions!</dd>
  <dt>Extensible</dt>
  <dd>User-defined aggregate or regular functions can be registered with the SQL
      parser.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">There's lots more to it, so please refer to the docs on the SQLite
    web page, listed above, for SQL details. Also refer to DBI for details on
    how to use DBI itself. The API works like every DBI module does. However,
    currently many statement attributes are not implemented or are limited by
    the typeless nature of the SQLite database.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="SQLITE_VERSION"><a class="permalink" href="#SQLITE_VERSION">SQLITE
  VERSION</a></h1>
DBD::SQLite is usually compiled with a bundled SQLite library (SQLite version
  3.29.0 as of this release) for consistency. However, a different version of
  SQLite may sometimes be used for some reasons like security, or some new
  experimental features.
<p class="Pp">You can look at
    <span class="Li">$DBD::SQLite::sqlite_version</span>
    (<span class="Li">&quot;3.x.y&quot;</span> format) or
    <span class="Li">$DBD::SQLite::sqlite_version_number</span>
    (<span class="Li">&quot;3xxxyyy&quot;</span> format) to find which version
    of SQLite is actually used. You can also check
    <span class="Li">&quot;DBD::SQLite::Constants::SQLITE_VERSION_NUMBER()&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can also find how the library is compiled by calling
    <span class="Li">&quot;DBD::SQLite::compile_options()&quot;</span> (see
    below).</p>

SQLite creates a file per a database. You should pass the
  <span class="Li">&quot;path&quot;</span> of the database file (with or without
  a parent directory) in the DBI connection string (as a database
  <span class="Li">&quot;name&quot;</span>):
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  my $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect(&quot;dbi:SQLite:dbname=$dbfile&quot;,&quot;&quot;,&quot;&quot;);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The file is opened in read/write mode, and will be created if it
    does not exist yet.</p>
<p class="Pp">Although the database is stored in a single file, the directory
    containing the database file must be writable by SQLite because the library
    will create several temporary files there.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the filename <span class="Li">$dbfile</span> is
    &quot;:memory:&quot;, then a private, temporary in-memory database is
    created for the connection. This in-memory database will vanish when the
    database connection is closed. It is handy for your library tests.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that future versions of SQLite might make use of additional
    special filenames that begin with the &quot;:&quot; character. It is
    recommended that when a database filename actually does begin with a
    &quot;:&quot; character you should prefix the filename with a pathname such
    as &quot;./&quot; to avoid ambiguity.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the filename <span class="Li">$dbfile</span> is an empty
    string, then a private, temporary on-disk database will be created. This
    private database will be automatically deleted as soon as the database
    connection is closed.</p>
<p class="Pp">As of 1.41_01, you can pass URI filename (see
    &lt;https://www.sqlite.org/uri.html&gt;) as well for finer control:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  my $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect(&quot;dbi:SQLite:uri=file:$path_to_dbfile?mode=rwc&quot;);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Note that this is not for remote SQLite database connection. You
    can only connect to a local database.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Read-Only_Database"><a class="permalink" href="#Read-Only_Database">Read-Only
  Database</a></h2>
You can set sqlite_open_flags (only) when you connect to a database:
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  use DBD::SQLite::Constants qw/:file_open/;
  my $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect(&quot;dbi:SQLite:$dbfile&quot;, undef, undef, {
    sqlite_open_flags =&gt; SQLITE_OPEN_READONLY,
  });
</pre>
<p class="Pp">See &lt;https://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/open.html&gt; for
  details.</p>
<p class="Pp">As of 1.49_05, you can also make a database read-only by setting
    <span class="Li">&quot;ReadOnly&quot;</span> attribute to true (only) when
    you connect to a database. Actually you can set it after you connect, but in
    that case, it can't make the database read-only, and you'll see a warning
    (which you can hide by turning <span class="Li">&quot;PrintWarn&quot;</span>
    off).</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="DBD::SQLite_And_File::Temp"><a class="permalink" href="#DBD::SQLite_And_File::Temp">DBD::SQLite
  And File::Temp</a></h2>
When you use File::Temp to create a temporary file/directory for SQLite
  databases, you need to remember:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>tempfile may be locked exclusively</dt>
  <dd>You may want to use <span class="Li">&quot;tempfile()&quot;</span> to
      create a temporary database filename for DBD::SQLite, but as noted in
      File::Temp's POD, this file may have an exclusive lock under some
      operating systems (notably Mac OSX), and result in a &quot;database is
      locked&quot; error. To avoid this, set EXLOCK option to false when you
      call <b>tempfile()</b>.
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
  ($fh, $filename) = tempfile($template, EXLOCK =&gt; 0);
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>CLEANUP may not work unless a database is disconnected</dt>
  <dd>When you set CLEANUP option to true when you create a temporary directory
      with <span class="Li">&quot;tempdir()&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;newdir()&quot;</span>, you may have to disconnect
      databases explicitly before the temporary directory is gone (notably under
      MS Windows).</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">(The above is quoted from the pod of File::Temp.)</p>
<p class="Pp">If you don't need to keep or share a temporary database, use
    &quot;:memory:&quot; database instead. It's much handier and cleaner for
    ordinary testing.</p>

Follow the advice in the SQLite FAQ (&lt;https://sqlite.org/faq.html&gt;).
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Under Unix, you should not carry an open SQLite database
  across a <b>fork()</b> system call into the child process. Problems will
  result if you do.</div>
<p class="Pp">You shouldn't (re)use a database handle you created (probably to
    set up a database schema etc) before you <b>fork()</b>. Otherwise, you might
    see a database corruption in the worst case.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you need to <b>fork()</b>, (re)open a database after you
    <b>fork()</b>. You might also want to tweak
    <span class="Li">&quot;sqlite_busy_timeout&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;sqlite_use_immediate_transaction&quot;</span> (see

<h2 class="Ss" id="Blobs"><a class="permalink" href="#Blobs">Blobs</a></h2>
As of version 1.11, blobs should &quot;just work&quot; in SQLite as text
  columns. However this will cause the data to be treated as a string, so SQL
  statements such as length(x) will return the length of the column as a NUL
  terminated string, rather than the size of the blob in bytes. In order to
  store natively as a BLOB use the following code:
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  use DBI qw(:sql_types);
  my $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect(&quot;dbi:SQLite:dbfile&quot;,&quot;&quot;,&quot;&quot;);

<h2 class="Ss" id="Functions_And_Bind_Parameters"><a class="permalink" href="#Functions_And_Bind_Parameters">Functions

As of this writing, a SQL that compares a return value of a function with a
  numeric bind value like this doesn't work as you might expect.
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  my $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare(q{
    SELECT bar FROM foo GROUP BY bar HAVING count(*) &gt; ?;
  });
  $sth-&gt;execute(5);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This is because DBD::SQLite assumes that all the bind values are
    text (and should be quoted) by default. Thus the above statement becomes
    like this while executing:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  SELECT bar FROM foo GROUP BY bar HAVING count(*) &gt; &quot;5&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">There are four workarounds for this.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>Use <b>bind_param()</b> explicitly</dt>
  <dd>As shown above in the <span class="Li">&quot;BLOB&quot;</span> section,
      you can always use <span class="Li">&quot;bind_param()&quot;</span> to

    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This is the most straightforward solution, but as noted above,

<h2 class="Ss" id="Pragma"><a class="permalink" href="#Pragma">Pragma</a></h2>
SQLite has a set of &quot;Pragma&quot;s to modify its operation or to query for
  its internal data. These are specific to SQLite and are not likely to work
  with other DBD libraries, but you may find some of these are quite useful,
  including:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>journal_mode</dt>
  <dd>You can use this pragma to change the journal mode for SQLite databases,
      maybe for better performance, or for compatibility.
    <p class="Pp">Its default mode is
        <span class="Li">&quot;DELETE&quot;</span>, which means SQLite uses a
        rollback journal to implement transactions, and the journal is deleted
        at the conclusion of each transaction. If you use
        <span class="Li">&quot;TRUNCATE&quot;</span> instead of
        <span class="Li">&quot;DELETE&quot;</span>, the journal will be
        truncated, which is usually much faster.</p>
    <p class="Pp">A <span class="Li">&quot;WAL&quot;</span> (write-ahead log)
        mode is introduced as of SQLite 3.7.0. This mode is persistent, and it
        stays in effect even after closing and reopening the database. In other
        words, once the <span class="Li">&quot;WAL&quot;</span> mode is set in
        an application or in a test script, the database becomes inaccessible by
        older clients. This tends to be an issue when you use a system
        <span class="Li">&quot;sqlite3&quot;</span> executable under a
        conservative operating system.</p>
    <p class="Pp">To fix this, You need to issue <span class="Li">&quot;PRAGMA
        journal_mode = DELETE&quot;</span> (or
        <span class="Li">&quot;TRUNCATE&quot;</span>) beforehand, or install a
        newer version of <span class="Li">&quot;sqlite3&quot;</span>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>legacy_file_format</dt>
  <dd>If you happen to need to create a SQLite database that will also be
      accessed by a very old SQLite client (prior to 3.3.0 released in Jan.
      2006), you need to set this pragma to ON before you create a
    database.</dd>
  <dt>reverse_unordered_selects</dt>
  <dd>You can set this pragma to ON to reverse the order of results of SELECT
      statements without an ORDER BY clause so that you can see if applications
      are making invalid assumptions about the result order.
    <p class="Pp">Note that SQLite 3.7.15 (bundled with DBD::SQLite 1.38_02)
        enhanced its query optimizer and the order of results of a SELECT
        statement without an ORDER BY clause may be different from the one of
        the previous versions.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>synchronous</dt>
  <dd>You can set set this pragma to OFF to make some of the operations in
      SQLite faster with a possible risk of database corruption in the worst
      case. See also &quot;Performance&quot; section below.</dd>

SQLite has started supporting foreign key constraints since 3.6.19 (released on
  Oct 14, 2009; bundled in DBD::SQLite 1.26_05). To be exact, SQLite has long
  been able to parse a schema with foreign keys, but the constraints has not
  been enforced. Now you can issue a

<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  $dbh-&gt;do(&quot;PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON&quot;);

<pre>
  $dbh-&gt;do(&quot;PRAGMA foreign_keys = OFF&quot;);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">As of this writing, this feature is disabled by default by the

    may break your applications, and actually broke some for us. If you have
    used a schema with foreign key constraints but haven't cared them much and
    supposed they're always ignored for SQLite, be prepared, and please do
    extensive testing to ensure that your applications will continue to work

  and Database Locking</a></h2>
The default transaction behavior of SQLite is
  <span class="Li">&quot;deferred&quot;</span>, that means, locks are not
  acquired until the first read or write operation, and thus it is possible that
  another thread or process could create a separate transaction and write to the
  database after the <span class="Li">&quot;BEGIN&quot;</span> on the current
  thread has executed, and eventually cause a &quot;deadlock&quot;. To avoid
  this, DBD::SQLite internally issues a <span class="Li">&quot;BEGIN
  IMMEDIATE&quot;</span> if you begin a transaction by calling
  <span class="Li">&quot;begin_work&quot;</span> or by turning off
  <span class="Li">&quot;AutoCommit&quot;</span> (since 1.38_01).
<p class="Pp">If you really need to turn off this feature for some reasons, set
    <span class="Li">&quot;sqlite_use_immediate_transaction&quot;</span>
    database handle attribute to false, and the default
    <span class="Li">&quot;deferred&quot;</span> transaction will be used.</p>

As the DBI doc says, you almost certainly do <b>not</b> need to call
  &quot;finish&quot; in DBI method if you fetch all rows (probably in a loop).
  However, there are several exceptions to this rule, and rolling-back of an
  unfinished <span class="Li">&quot;SELECT&quot;</span> statement is one of such
  exceptional cases.
<p class="Pp">SQLite prohibits <span class="Li">&quot;ROLLBACK&quot;</span> of
    unfinished <span class="Li">&quot;SELECT&quot;</span> statements in a
    transaction (See &lt;http://sqlite.org/lang_transaction.html&gt; for

    before you issue a rollback.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Processing_Multiple_Statements_At_A_Time"><a class="permalink" href="#Processing_Multiple_Statements_At_A_Time">Processing
  Multiple Statements At A Time</a></h2>
DBI's statement handle is not supposed to process multiple statements at a time.
  So if you pass a string that contains multiple statements (a
  <span class="Li">&quot;dump&quot;</span>) to a statement handle (via
  <span class="Li">&quot;prepare&quot;</span> or
  <span class="Li">&quot;do&quot;</span>), DBD::SQLite only processes the first
  statement, and discards the rest.
<p class="Pp">If you need to process multiple statements at a time, set a
    <span class="Li">&quot;sqlite_allow_multiple_statements&quot;</span>
    attribute of a database handle to true when you connect to a database, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;do&quot;</span> method takes care of the rest (since
    1.30_01, and without creating DBI's statement handles internally since
    1.47_01). If you do need to use <span class="Li">&quot;prepare&quot;</span>
    or <span class="Li">&quot;prepare_cached&quot;</span> (which I don't
    recommend in this case, because typically there's no placeholder nor
    reusable part in a dump), you can look at
    <span class="Li">&quot;$sth-&gt;{sqlite_unprepared_statements}&quot;</span>

Because of historical reasons, DBD::SQLite's
  <span class="Li">&quot;TYPE&quot;</span> statement handle attribute returns an
  array ref of string values, contrary to the DBI specification. This value is
  also less useful for SQLite users because SQLite uses dynamic type system
  (that means, the datatype of a value is associated with the value itself, not
  with its container).
<p class="Pp">As of version 1.61_02, if you set
    <span class="Li">&quot;sqlite_prefer_numeric_type&quot;</span> database
    handle attribute to true, <span class="Li">&quot;TYPE&quot;</span> statement
    handle attribute returns an array of integer, as an experiment.</p>

SQLite is fast, very fast. Matt processed his 72MB log file with it, inserting
  the data (400,000+ rows) by using transactions and only committing every 1000
  rows (otherwise the insertion is quite slow), and then performing queries on
  the data.
<p class="Pp">Queries like count(*) and avg(bytes) took fractions of a second to
    return, but what surprised him most of all was:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  SELECT url, count(*) as count
  FROM access_log
  GROUP BY url
  ORDER BY count desc
  LIMIT 20
</pre>
<p class="Pp">To discover the top 20 hit URLs on the site
    (&lt;http://axkit.org&gt;), and it returned within 2 seconds. He was
    seriously considering switching his log analysis code to use this little
    speed demon!</p>
<p class="Pp">Oh yeah, and that was with no indexes on the table, on a 400MHz
    PIII.</p>
<p class="Pp">For best performance be sure to tune your hdparm settings if you
    are using linux. Also you might want to set:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  PRAGMA synchronous = OFF
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Which will prevent SQLite from doing fsync's when writing (which
    slows down non-transactional writes significantly) at the expense of some
    peace of mind. Also try playing with the cache_size pragma.</p>
<p class="Pp">The memory usage of SQLite can also be tuned using the cache_size
    pragma.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  $dbh-&gt;do(&quot;PRAGMA cache_size = 800000&quot;);

<p class="Pp">SQLite includes syntactic support for an infix operator 'REGEXP',
    but without any implementation. The
    <span class="Li">&quot;DBD::SQLite&quot;</span> driver automatically
    registers an implementation that performs standard perl regular expression
    matching, using current locale. So for example you can search for words
    starting with an 'A' with a query like</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  SELECT * from table WHERE column REGEXP '\bA\w+'
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If you want case-insensitive searching, use perl regex flags, like
    this :</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  SELECT * from table WHERE column REGEXP '(?i:\bA\w+)'
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The default REGEXP implementation can be overridden through the
    <span class="Li">&quot;create_function&quot;</span> API described above.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that regexp matching will <b>not</b> use SQLite indices, but
    will iterate over all rows, so it could be quite costly in terms of
    performance.</p>

This method manually registers a new function which will be usable in an SQL

  automatically on demand: see section &quot;COLLATION FUNCTIONS&quot; below.
<p class="Pp">The method's parameters are:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>$name</dt>
  <dd>The name of the function exposed to SQL.</dd>

This method manually registers a callback function that will be invoked whenever

  callback is invoked as
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  $code_ref-&gt;($dbh, $collation_name)

<p class="Pp">An initial callback is already registered by

This method will register a new aggregate function which can then be used from
  SQL. The method's parameters are:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>$name</dt>
  <dd>The name of the aggregate function, this is the name under which the
      function will be available from SQL.</dd>
  <dt>$argc</dt>
  <dd>This is an integer which tells the SQL parser how many arguments the
      function takes. If that number is -1, the function can take any number of
      arguments.</dd>
  <dt>$pkg</dt>
  <dd>This is the package which implements the aggregator interface.</dd>
  <dt>$flags</dt>
  <dd>You can optionally pass an extra flag bit to create_aggregate, which then
      would be ORed with SQLITE_UTF8 (default). As of 1.47_02 (SQLite 3.8.9),
      only meaning bit is SQLITE_DETERMINISTIC (introduced at SQLite 3.8.3),
      which can make the function perform better. See C API documentation at
      &lt;http://sqlite.org/c3ref/create_function.html&gt; for details.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The aggregator interface consists of defining three methods:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>new()</b></dt>
  <dd>This method will be called once to create an object which should be used
      to aggregate the rows in a particular group. The <b>step()</b> and
      <b>finalize()</b> methods will be called upon the reference return by the
      method.</dd>
  <dt>step(@_)</dt>
  <dd>This method will be called once for each row in the aggregate.</dd>
  <dt><b>finalize()</b></dt>
  <dd>This method will be called once all rows in the aggregate were processed
      and it should return the aggregate function's result. When there is no
      rows in the aggregate, <b>finalize()</b> will be called right after
      <b>new()</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Here is a simple aggregate function which returns the variance
    (example adapted from pysqlite):</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  package variance;
  
  sub new { bless [], shift; }
  
  sub step {

      return $sigma;
  }
  
  $dbh-&gt;sqlite_create_aggregate( &quot;variance&quot;, 1, 'variance' );

This method registers an authorizer callback to be invoked whenever SQL

  specific action but allow the SQL statement to continue to be compiled, or

  statement to be rejected with an error. If the authorizer callback returns any
  other value, then <span class="Li">&quot;prepare&quot;</span> call that
  triggered the authorizer will fail with an error message.
<p class="Pp">An authorizer is used when preparing SQL statements from an
    untrusted source, to ensure that the SQL statements do not try to access
    data they are not allowed to see, or that they do not try to execute
    malicious statements that damage the database. For example, an application
    may allow a user to enter arbitrary SQL queries for evaluation by a
    database. But the application does not want the user to be able to make
    arbitrary changes to the database. An authorizer could then be put in place
    while the user-entered SQL is being prepared that disallows everything

  explicitly <span class="Li">&quot;use&quot;</span>d at compile time. For
  example, an authorizer that forbids any DELETE operation would be written as
  follows :
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  use DBD::SQLite;
  $dbh-&gt;sqlite_set_authorizer(sub {
    my $action_code = shift;
    return $action_code == DBD::SQLite::DELETE ? DBD::SQLite::DENY
                                               : DBD::SQLite::OK;
  });
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The list of constants implemented in
    <span class="Li">&quot;DBD::SQLite&quot;</span> is given below; more

The &quot;set_authorizer&quot; method registers a callback function that is
  invoked to authorize certain SQL statement actions. The first parameter to the
  callback is an integer code that specifies what action is being authorized.
  The second and third parameters to the callback are strings, the meaning of
  which varies according to the action code. Below is the list of action codes,
  together with their associated strings.

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Definition"><a class="permalink" href="#Definition">Definition</a></h2>
SQLite v3 provides the ability for users to supply arbitrary comparison
  functions, known as user-defined &quot;collation sequences&quot; or
  &quot;collating functions&quot;, to be used for comparing two text values.
  &lt;https://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html#collation&gt; explains how
  collations are used in various SQL expressions.
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Builtin_collation_sequences"><a class="permalink" href="#Builtin_collation_sequences">Builtin
  collation sequences</a></h2>
The following collation sequences are builtin within SQLite :
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>BINARY</b></dt>
  <dd>Compares string data using <b>memcmp()</b>, regardless of text
    encoding.</dd>
  <dt><b>NOCASE</b></dt>
  <dd>The same as binary, except the 26 upper case characters of ASCII are
      folded to their lower case equivalents before the comparison is performed.
      Note that only ASCII characters are case folded. SQLite does not attempt
      to do full UTF case folding due to the size of the tables required.</dd>
  <dt><b>RTRIM</b></dt>
  <dd>The same as binary, except that trailing space characters are
    ignored.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">In addition, <span class="Li">&quot;DBD::SQLite&quot;</span>
    automatically installs the following collation sequences :</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>perl</b></dt>
  <dd>corresponds to the Perl <span class="Li">&quot;cmp&quot;</span>
    operator</dd>
  <dt><b>perllocale</b></dt>
  <dd>Perl <span class="Li">&quot;cmp&quot;</span> operator, in a context where
      <span class="Li">&quot;use locale&quot;</span> is activated.</dd>
</dl>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Usage"><a class="permalink" href="#Usage">Usage</a></h2>
You can write for example
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  CREATE TABLE foo(
      txt1 COLLATE perl,
      txt2 COLLATE perllocale,
      txt3 COLLATE nocase
  )
</pre>
<p class="Pp">or</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  SELECT * FROM foo ORDER BY name COLLATE perllocale
</pre>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Unicode_handling"><a class="permalink" href="#Unicode_handling">Unicode
  handling</a></h2>
If the attribute <span class="Li">&quot;$dbh-&gt;{sqlite_unicode}&quot;</span>
  is set, strings coming from the database and passed to the collation function
  will be properly tagged with the utf8 flag; but this only works if the
  <span class="Li">&quot;sqlite_unicode&quot;</span> attribute is set
  <b>before</b> the first call to a perl collation sequence . The recommended
  way to activate unicode is to set the parameter at connection time :
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  my $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect(
      &quot;dbi:SQLite:dbname=foo&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;,
      {
          RaiseError     =&gt; 1,
          sqlite_unicode =&gt; 1,
      }
  );
</pre>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Adding_user-defined_collations"><a class="permalink" href="#Adding_user-defined_collations">Adding
  user-defined collations</a></h2>
The native SQLite API for adding user-defined collations is exposed through
  methods &quot;sqlite_create_collation&quot; and
  &quot;sqlite_collation_needed&quot;.
<p class="Pp">To avoid calling these functions every time a
    <span class="Li">$dbh</span> handle is created,
    <span class="Li">&quot;DBD::SQLite&quot;</span> offers a simpler interface
    through the <span class="Li">%DBD::SQLite::COLLATION</span> hash : just
    insert your own collation functions in that hash, and whenever an unknown
    collation name is encountered in SQL, the appropriate collation function
    will be loaded on demand from the hash. For example, here is a way to sort
    text values regardless of their accented characters :</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  use DBD::SQLite;
  $DBD::SQLite::COLLATION{no_accents} = sub {
    my ( $a, $b ) = map lc, @_;
    tr[&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;]
      [aaaaaacdeeeeiiiinoooooouuuuy] for $a, $b;
    $a cmp $b;
  };
  my $dbh  = DBI-&gt;connect(&quot;dbi:SQLite:dbname=dbfile&quot;);
  my $sql  = &quot;SELECT ... FROM ... ORDER BY ... COLLATE no_accents&quot;);
  my $rows = $dbh-&gt;selectall_arrayref($sql);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The builtin <span class="Li">&quot;perl&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;perllocale&quot;</span> collations are predefined in
    that same hash.</p>
<p class="Pp">The COLLATION hash is a global registry within the current
    process; hence there is a risk of undesired side-effects. Therefore, to
    prevent action at distance, the hash is implemented as a
    &quot;write-only&quot; hash, that will happily accept new entries, but will
    raise an exception if any attempt is made to override or delete a existing
    entry (including the builtin <span class="Li">&quot;perl&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;perllocale&quot;</span>).</p>
<p class="Pp">If you really, really need to change or delete an entry, you can
    always grab the tied object underneath
    <span class="Li">%DBD::SQLite::COLLATION</span> --- but don't do that unless
    you really know what you are doing. Also observe that changes in the global
    hash will not modify existing collations in existing database handles: it
    will only affect new <i>requests</i> for collations. In other words, if you
    want to change the behaviour of a collation within an existing
    <span class="Li">$dbh</span>, you need to call the
    &quot;create_collation&quot; method directly.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="FULLTEXT_SEARCH"><a class="permalink" href="#FULLTEXT_SEARCH">FULLTEXT

SQLite is bundled with an extension module for full-text indexing. Tables with
  this feature enabled can be efficiently queried to find rows that contain one
  or more instances of some specified words, in any column, even if the table
  contains many large documents.
<p class="Pp">Explanations for using this feature are provided in a separate

<h1 class="Sh" id="R*_TREE_SUPPORT"><a class="permalink" href="#R*_TREE_SUPPORT">R*
  TREE SUPPORT</a></h1>
The RTREE extension module within SQLite adds support for creating a R-Tree, a
  special index for range and multidimensional queries. This allows users to
  create tables that can be loaded with (as an example) geospatial data such as
  latitude/longitude coordinates for buildings within a city :
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE city_buildings USING rtree(
     id,               -- Integer primary key
     minLong, maxLong, -- Minimum and maximum longitude
     minLat, maxLat    -- Minimum and maximum latitude
  );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">then query which buildings overlap or are contained within a
    specified region:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  # IDs that are contained within query coordinates
  my $contained_sql = &lt;&lt;&quot;&quot;;
  SELECT id FROM city_buildings
     WHERE  minLong &gt;= ? AND maxLong &lt;= ?
     AND    minLat  &gt;= ? AND maxLat  &lt;= ?
  
  # ... and those that overlap query coordinates
  my $overlap_sql = &lt;&lt;&quot;&quot;;
  SELECT id FROM city_buildings
     WHERE    maxLong &gt;= ? AND minLong &lt;= ?
     AND      maxLat  &gt;= ? AND minLat  &lt;= ?
  
  my $contained = $dbh-&gt;selectcol_arrayref($contained_sql,undef,
                        $minLong, $maxLong, $minLat, $maxLat);
  
  my $overlapping = $dbh-&gt;selectcol_arrayref($overlap_sql,undef,
                        $minLong, $maxLong, $minLat, $maxLat);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">For more detail, please see the SQLite R-Tree page
    (&lt;https://www.sqlite.org/rtree.html&gt;). Note that custom R-Tree queries

<h1 class="Sh" id="VIRTUAL_TABLES_IMPLEMENTED_IN_PERL"><a class="permalink" href="#VIRTUAL_TABLES_IMPLEMENTED_IN_PERL">VIRTUAL
  TABLES IMPLEMENTED IN PERL</a></h1>
SQLite has a concept of &quot;virtual tables&quot; which look like regular
  tables but are implemented internally through specific functions. The fulltext
  or R* tree features described in the previous chapters are examples of such
  virtual tables, implemented in C code.
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;DBD::SQLite&quot;</span> also supports
    virtual tables implemented in <i>Perl code</i>: see
    DBD::SQLite::VirtualTable for using or implementing such virtual tables.
    These can have many interesting uses for joining regular DBMS data with some
    other kind of data within your Perl programs. Bundled with the present
    distribution are :</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>DBD::SQLite::VirtualTable::FileContent : implements a virtual column that
      exposes file contents. This is especially useful in conjunction with a
      fulltext index; see DBD::SQLite::Fulltext_search.</li>
  <li>DBD::SQLite::VirtualTable::PerlData : binds to a Perl array within the
      Perl program. This can be used for simple import/export operations, for
      debugging purposes, for joining data from different sources, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">Other Perl virtual tables may also be published separately on
    CPAN.</p>

Since 1.30_01, you can retrieve the bundled SQLite C source and/or header like
  this:
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  use File::ShareDir 'dist_dir';
  use File::Spec::Functions 'catfile';
  
  # the whole sqlite3.h header
  my $sqlite3_h = catfile(dist_dir('DBD-SQLite'), 'sqlite3.h');
  
  # or only a particular header, amalgamated in sqlite3.c
  my $what_i_want = 'parse.h';
  my $sqlite3_c = catfile(dist_dir('DBD-SQLite'), 'sqlite3.c');
  open my $fh, '&lt;', $sqlite3_c or die $!;
  my $code = do { local $/; &lt;$fh&gt; };
  my ($parse_h) = $code =~ m{(
    /\*+[ ]Begin[ ]file[ ]$what_i_want[ ]\*+
    .+?
    /\*+[ ]End[ ]of[ ]$what_i_want[ ]\*+/
  )}sx;
  open my $out, '&gt;', $what_i_want or die $!;
  print $out $parse_h;
  close $out;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">You usually want to use this in your extension's
    <span class="Li">&quot;Makefile.PL&quot;</span>, and you may want to add
    DBD::SQLite to your extension's
    <span class="Li">&quot;CONFIGURE_REQUIRES&quot;</span> to ensure your
    extension users use the same C source/header they use to build DBD::SQLite
    itself (instead of the ones installed in their system).</p>

Custom queries of a R-Tree index using a callback are possible with the SQLite C

  a callback that narrowed the result set down based on a specific need, such as
