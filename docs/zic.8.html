<p class="Pp">Input lines are made up of fields. Fields are separated from one
    another by any number of white space characters. Leading and trailing white
    space on input lines is ignored. An unquoted sharp character (#) in the
    input introduces a comment which extends to the end of the line the sharp
    character appears on. White space characters and sharp characters may be
    enclosed in double quotes (&quot;) if they are to be used as part of a
    field. Any line that is blank (after comment stripping) is ignored.
    Non-blank lines are expected to be of one of three types: rule lines, zone
    lines, and link lines.</p>
<p class="Pp">Names (such as month names) must be in English and are case
    insensitive. Abbreviations, if used, must be unambiguous in context.</p>
<p class="Pp">A rule line has the form:</p>
<div class="Bd
  Bd-indent"><code class="Li">Rule	NAME	FROM	TO	TYPE	IN	ON		AT	SAVE	LETTER/S</code></div>
For example:
<div class="Bd
  Bd-indent"><code class="Li">Rule	US	1967	1973	-	Apr	lastSun	2:00	1:00	D</code></div>
<p class="Pp">The fields that make up a rule line are:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>NAME</dt>
  <dd>Give the (arbitrary) name of the set of rules this rule is part of.</dd>
  <dt>FROM</dt>
  <dd>Give the first year in which the rule applies. Any integer year can be
      supplied; the Gregorian calendar is assumed. The word
      <i class="Em">minimum</i> (or an abbreviation) means the minimum year
      representable as an integer. The word <i class="Em">maximum</i> (or an
      abbreviation) means the maximum year representable as an integer. Rules
      can describe times that are not representable as time values, with the
      unrepresentable times ignored; this allows rules to be portable among
      hosts with differing time value types.</dd>
  <dt>TO</dt>
  <dd>Give the final year in which the rule applies. In addition to
      <i class="Em">minimum</i> and <i class="Em">maximum</i> (as above), the
      word <i class="Em">only</i> (or an abbreviation) may be used to repeat the
      value of the <i class="Em">FROM</i> field.</dd>
  <dt>TYPE</dt>
  <dd>Give the type of year in which the rule applies. If <i class="Em">TYPE</i>
      is <i class="Em">-</i> then the rule applies in all years between
      <i class="Em">FROM</i> and <i class="Em">TO</i> inclusive. If
      <i class="Em">TYPE</i> is something else, then <code class="Nm">zic</code>
      executes the command <code class="Li">yearistype</code>
      <var class="Ar">year</var> <var class="Ar">type</var> to check the type of
      a year: an exit status of zero is taken to mean that the year is of the
      given type; an exit status of one is taken to mean that the year is not of
      the given type.</dd>
  <dt>IN</dt>
  <dd>Name the month in which the rule takes effect. Month names may be
      abbreviated.</dd>

      time zone abbreviations to be used when this rule is in effect. If this
      field is <i class="Em">-</i>, the variable part is null.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p class="Pp">A zone line has the form:</p>
<div class="Bd
  Bd-indent"><code class="Li">Zone	NAME	GMTOFF	RULES/SAVE	FORMAT	[UNTILYEAR
  [MONTH [DAY [TIME]]]]</code></div>
For example:
<div class="Bd
  Bd-indent"><code class="Li">Zone	Australia/Adelaide	9:30	Aus	CST	1971 Oct 31
  2:00</code></div>
The fields that make up a zone line are:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>NAME</dt>
  <dd>The name of the time zone. This is the name used in creating the time
      conversion information file for the zone.</dd>
  <dt>GMTOFF</dt>
  <dd>The amount of time to add to UTC to get standard time in this zone. This
      field has the same format as the <i class="Em">AT</i> and
      <i class="Em">SAVE</i> fields of rule lines; begin the field with a minus
      sign if time must be subtracted from UTC.</dd>
  <dt>RULES/SAVE</dt>
  <dd>The name of the rule(s) that apply in the time zone or, alternately, an
      amount of time to add to local standard time. If this field is
      <i class="Em">-</i> then standard time always applies in the time
    zone.</dd>
  <dt>FORMAT</dt>
  <dd>The format for time zone abbreviations in this time zone. The pair of
      characters <i class="Em">%s</i> is used to show where the &#x201C;variable
      part&#x201D; of the time zone abbreviation goes. Alternately, a slash (/)
      separates standard and daylight abbreviations.</dd>
  <dt>UNTILYEAR [MONTH [DAY [TIME]]]</dt>
  <dd>The time at which the UTC offset or the rule(s) change for a location. It
      is specified as a year, a month, a day, and a time of day. If this is
      specified, the time zone information is generated from the given UTC
      offset and rule change until the time specified. The month, day, and time
      of day have the same format as the IN, ON, and AT fields of a rule;
      trailing fields can be omitted, and default to the earliest possible value
      for the missing fields.
    <p class="Pp">The next line must be a &#x201C;continuation&#x201D; line;
        this has the same form as a zone line except that the string
        &#x201C;Zone&#x201D; and the name are omitted, as the continuation line
        will place information starting at the time specified as the
        <i class="Em">until</i> information in the previous line in the file
        used by the previous line. Continuation lines may contain
        <i class="Em">until</i> information, just as zone lines do, indicating
        that the next line is a further continuation.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">A link line has the form</p>
<div class="Bd Bd-indent"><code class="Li">Link	LINK-FROM	LINK-TO</code></div>
For example:
<div class="Bd
  Bd-indent"><code class="Li">Link	Europe/Istanbul	Asia/Istanbul</code></div>
The <i class="Em">LINK-FROM</i> field should appear as the
  <i class="Em">NAME</i> field in some zone line; the <i class="Em">LINK-TO</i>
  field is used as an alternate name for that zone.
<p class="Pp">Except for continuation lines, lines may appear in any order in
    the input.</p>
<p class="Pp">Lines in the file that describes leap seconds have the following
    form:</p>
<div class="Bd
  Bd-indent"><code class="Li">Leap	YEAR	MONTH	DAY	HH:MM:SS	CORR	R/S</code></div>
For example:
<div class="Bd
  Bd-indent"><code class="Li">Leap	1974	Dec	31	23:59:60	+	S</code></div>
The <i class="Em">YEAR</i>, <i class="Em">MONTH</i>, <i class="Em">DAY</i>, and
  <i class="Em">HH:MM:SS</i> fields tell when the leap second happened. The
  <i class="Em">CORR</i> field should be &#x201C;+&#x201D; if a second was added
  or &#x201C;-&#x201D; if a second was skipped. The <i class="Em">R/S</i> field
  should be (an abbreviation of) &#x201C;Stationary&#x201D; if the leap second
  time given by the other fields should be interpreted as UTC or (an
  abbreviation of) &#x201C;Rolling&#x201D; if the leap second time given by the
  other fields should be interpreted as local wall clock time.

</pre>
In this example, the zone is named Europe/Zurich but it has an alias as
  Switzerland. Zurich was 34 minutes and 8 seconds west of GMT until 1848-09-12
  at 00:00, when the offset changed to 29 minutes and 44 seconds. After
  1894-06-01 at 00:00 Swiss daylight saving rules (defined with lines beginning
  with &quot;Rule Swiss&quot;) apply, and the GMT offset became one hour. From
  1981 to the present, EU daylight saving rules have applied, and the UTC offset
  has remained at one hour.
<p class="Pp">In 1940, daylight saving time applied from November 2 at 00:00 to
    December 31 at 00:00. In 1941 and 1942, daylight saving time applied from
    the first Sunday in May at 02:00 to the first Sunday in October at 00:00.
    The pre-1981 EU daylight-saving rules have no effect here, but are included
    for completeness. Since 1981, daylight saving has begun on the last Sunday
    in March at 01:00 UTC. Until 1995 it ended the last Sunday in September at
    01:00 UTC, but this changed to the last Sunday in October starting in
  1996.</p>
<p class="Pp">For purposes of display, &quot;LMT&quot; and &quot;BMT&quot; were
    initially used, respectively. Since Swiss rules and later EU rules were
    applied, the display name for the timezone has been CET for standard time
    and CEST for daylight saving time.</p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="NOTES"><a class="permalink" href="#NOTES">NOTES</a></h1>
For areas with more than two types of local time, you may need to use local
  standard time in the <i class="Em">AT</i> field of the earliest transition
  time's rule to ensure that the earliest transition time recorded in the
  compiled file is correct.
<p class="Pp">If, for a particular zone, a clock advance caused by the start of
    daylight saving coincides with and is equal to a clock retreat caused by a
    change in UTC offset, <code class="Nm">zic</code> produces a single
    transition to daylight saving at the new UTC offset (without any change in
    wall clock time). To get separate transitions use multiple zone continuation
    lines specifying transition instants using universal time.</p>
