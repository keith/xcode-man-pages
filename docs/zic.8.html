  <dd>Limit the applicability of output files to timestamps in the range from

      (exclusive), where <var class="Ar">lo</var> and <var class="Ar">hi</var>
      are possibly signed decimal counts of seconds since the Epoch (1970-01-01
      00:00:00 UTC). Omitted counts default to extreme values. The output files
      use UT offset 0 and abbreviation &#x201C;-00&#x201D; in place of the
      omitted timestamp data. For example, <code class="Fl">-r</code>
      <code class="Fl">-@0</code> omits data intended for negative timestamps
      (i.e., before the Epoch), and <code class="Fl">-r</code>
      <code class="Fl">-@0/@2147483648</code> outputs data intended only for
      nonnegative timestamps that fit into 31-bit signed integers. Although this
      option typically reduces the output file's size, the size can increase due
      to the need to represent the timestamp range boundaries, particularly if
      <var class="Ar">hi</var> causes a TZif file to contain explicit entries
      for <a class="permalink" href="#pre-"><i class="Em" id="pre-">pre-</i></a>
      <var class="Ar">hi</var> transitions rather than concisely representing

    <ul class="Bl-bullet">
      <li>The input specifies a link to a link, something not supported by some
          older parsers, including <code class="Nm">zic</code> itself through
          release 2022e.</li>
      <li>A year that appears in a data file is outside the range of
          representable years.</li>
      <li>A time of 24:00 or more appears in the input. Pre-1998 versions of
          <code class="Nm">zic</code> prohibit 24:00, and pre-2007 versions
          prohibit times greater than 24:00.</li>
      <li>A rule goes past the start or end of the month. Pre-2004 versions of
          <code class="Nm">zic</code> prohibit this.</li>
      <li>A time zone abbreviation uses a
          &#x2018;<code class="Li">%z</code>&#x2019; format. Pre-2015 versions
          of <code class="Nm">zic</code> do not support this.</li>
      <li>A timestamp contains fractional seconds. Pre-2018 versions of
          <code class="Nm">zic</code> do not support this.</li>
      <li>The input contains abbreviations that are mishandled by pre-2018
          versions of <code class="Nm">zic</code> due to a longstanding coding
          bug. These abbreviations include &#x201C;L&#x201D; for
          &#x201C;Link&#x201D;, &#x201C;mi&#x201D; for &#x201C;min&#x201D;,
          &#x201C;Sa&#x201D; for &#x201C;Sat&#x201D;, and &#x201C;Su&#x201D; for
          &#x201C;Sun&#x201D;.</li>
      <li>The output file does not contain all the information about the
          long-term future of a timezone, because the future cannot be
          summarized as an extended POSIX TZ string. For example, as of 2023
          this problem occurs for Morocco's daylight-saving rules, as these
          rules are based on predictions for when Ramadan will be observed,
          something that an extended POSIX TZ string cannot represent.</li>
      <li>The output contains data that may not be handled properly by client
          code designed for older <code class="Nm">zic</code> output formats.
          These compatibility issues affect only timestamps before 1970 or after
          the start of 2038.</li>
      <li>The output contains a truncated leap second table, which can cause
          some older TZif readers to misbehave. This can occur if the
          <code class="Fl">-L</code> option is used, and either an Expires line
          is present or the <code class="Fl">-r</code> option is also used.</li>
      <li>The output file contains more than 1200 transitions, which may be
          mishandled by some clients. The current reference client supports at
          most 2000 transitions; pre-2014 versions of the reference client
          support at most 1200 transitions.</li>
      <li>A time zone abbreviation has fewer than 3 or more than 6 characters.
          POSIX requires at least 3, and requires implementations to support at
          least 6.</li>
      <li>An output file name contains a byte that is not an ASCII letter,
          &#x201C;-&#x201D;, &#x201C;/&#x201D;, or &#x201C;_&#x201D;; or it
          contains a file name component that contains more than 14 bytes or
          that starts with &#x201C;-&#x201D;.</li>

<p class="Pp">Input files use the format described in this section; output files
    use <a class="Xr">tzfile(5)</a> format.</p>
<p class="Pp">Input files should be text files, that is, they should be a series
    of zero or more lines, each ending in a newline byte and containing at most
    2048 bytes counting the newline, and without any NUL bytes. The input text's
    encoding is typically UTF-8 or ASCII; it should have a unibyte
    representation for the POSIX Portable Character Set (PPCS)
    https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap06.html and
    the encoding's non-unibyte characters should consist entirely of non-PPCS
    bytes. Non-PPCS characters typically occur only in comments: although output
    file names and time zone abbreviations can contain nearly any character,
    other software will work better if these are limited to the restricted
    syntax described under the <code class="Fl">-v</code> option.</p>
<p class="Pp">Input lines are made up of fields. Fields are separated from one
    another by one or more white space characters. The white space characters
    are space, form feed, carriage return, newline, tab, and vertical tab.
    Leading and trailing white space on input lines is ignored. An unquoted
    sharp character (#) in the input introduces a comment which extends to the
    end of the line the sharp character appears on. White space characters and
    sharp characters may be enclosed in double quotes (&quot;) if they're to be
    used as part of a field. Any line that is blank (after comment stripping) is
    ignored. Nonblank lines are expected to be of one of three types: rule
    lines, zone lines, and link lines.</p>
<p class="Pp">Names must be in English and are case insensitive. They appear in
    several contexts, and include month and weekday names and keywords such as
    &#x201C;maximum&#x201D;, &#x201C;only&#x201D;, &#x201C;Rolling&#x201D;, and
    &#x201C;Zone&#x201D;. A name can be abbreviated by omitting all but an
    initial prefix; any abbreviation must be unambiguous in context.</p>
<p class="Pp">A rule line has the form</p>
<div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent Li">
<pre>Rule	NAME	FROM	TO	-	IN	ON	AT	SAVE	LETTER/S</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">For example:</p>
<div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent Li">
<pre>Rule	US	1967	1973	-	Apr	lastSun	2:00w	1:00d	D</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The fields that make up a rule line are:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>NAME</dt>
  <dd>Gives the name of the rule set that contains this line. The name must
      start with a character that is neither an ASCII digit nor
      &#x201C;-&#x201D; nor &#x201C;+&#x201D;. To allow for future extensions,
      an unquoted name should not contain characters from the set
      &#x201C;&#x2018;<code class="Li">!$%&amp;'()*,/:;&lt;=&gt;?@[]^`{|}~</code>&#x2019;&#x201D;.</dd>
  <dt>FROM</dt>
  <dd>Gives the first year in which the rule applies. Any signed integer year
      can be supplied; the proleptic Gregorian calendar is assumed, with year 0
      preceding year 1. The word <code class="Cm">minimum</code> (or an
      abbreviation) means the indefinite past. The word
      <code class="Cm">maximum</code> (or an abbreviation) means the indefinite
      future. Rules can describe times that are not representable as time
      values, with the unrepresentable times ignored; this allows rules to be
      portable among hosts with differing time value types.</dd>
  <dt>TO</dt>
  <dd>Gives the final year in which the rule applies. In addition to
      <code class="Cm">minimum</code> and <code class="Cm">maximum</code> (as
      above), the word <code class="Cm">only</code> (or an abbreviation) may be
      used to repeat the value of the <var class="Ar">FROM</var> field.</dd>
  <dt>-</dt>
  <dd>Is a reserved field and should always contain
      &#x2018;<code class="Li">-</code>&#x2019; for compatibility with older
      versions of <code class="Nm">zic</code>. It was previously known as the
      <var class="Ar">TYPE</var> field, which could contain values to allow a
      separate script to further restrict in which &#x201C;types&#x201D; of
      years the rule would apply.</dd>
  <dt>IN</dt>
  <dd>Names the month in which the rule takes effect. Month names may be
      abbreviated.</dd>
  <dt>ON</dt>
  <dd>Gives the day on which the rule takes effect. Recognized forms include:

        or spelled out in full. There must be no white space characters within
        the <var class="Ar">ON</var> field. The &#x201C;&lt;=&#x201D; and
        &#x201C;&gt;=&#x201D; constructs can result in a day in the neighboring
        month; for example, the IN-ON combination &#x201C;Oct Sun&gt;=31&#x201D;
        stands for the first Sunday on or after October 31, even if that Sunday
        occurs in November.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>AT</dt>
  <dd>Gives the time of day at which the rule takes effect, relative to 00:00,
      the start of a calendar day. Recognized forms include:

    <p class="Pp">Although <code class="Nm">zic</code> rounds times to the
        nearest integer second (breaking ties to the even integer), the
        fractions may be useful to other applications requiring greater
        precision. The source format does not specify any maximum precision. Any
        of these forms may be followed by the letter
        &#x2018;<code class="Li">w</code>&#x2019; if the given time is local or
        &#x201C;wall clock&#x201D; time,
        &#x2018;<code class="Li">s</code>&#x2019; if the given time is standard
        time without any adjustment for daylight saving, or

        &#x2018;<code class="Li">g</code>&#x2019; or
        &#x2018;<code class="Li">z</code>&#x2019;) if the given time is
        universal time; in the absence of an indicator, local (wall clock) time
        is assumed. These forms ignore leap seconds; for example, if a leap
        second occurs at 00:59:60 local time,
        &#x2018;<code class="Li">1:00</code>&#x2019; stands for 3601 seconds
        after local midnight instead of the usual 3600 seconds. The intent is
        that a rule line describes the instants when a clock/calendar set to the
        type of time specified in the <var class="Ar">AT</var> field would show
        the specified date and time of day.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>SAVE</dt>
  <dd>Gives the amount of time to be added to local standard time when the rule
      is in effect, and whether the resulting time is standard or daylight
      saving. This field has the same format as the <var class="Ar">AT</var>
      field except with a different set of suffix letters:
      &#x2018;<code class="Li">s</code>&#x2019; for standard time and
      &#x2018;<code class="Li">d</code>&#x2019; for daylight saving time. The
      suffix letter is typically omitted, and defaults to
      &#x2018;<code class="Li">s</code>&#x2019; if the offset is zero and to
      &#x2018;<code class="Li">d</code>&#x2019; otherwise. Negative offsets are
      allowed; in Ireland, for example, daylight saving time is observed in
      winter and has a negative offset relative to Irish Standard Time. The
      offset is merely added to standard time; for example,
      <code class="Nm">zic</code> does not distinguish a 10:30 standard time
      plus an 0:30 <var class="Ar">SAVE</var> from a 10:00 standard time plus a
      1:00 <var class="Ar">SAVE</var>.</dd>
  <dt>LETTER/S</dt>
  <dd>Gives the &#x201C;variable part&#x201D; (for example, the

      &#x201C;EDT&#x201D;) of time zone abbreviations to be used when this rule
      is in effect. If this field is &#x2018;<code class="Li">-</code>&#x2019;,
      the variable part is null.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">A zone line has the form</p>
<div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent Li">
<pre>Zone	NAME	STDOFF	RULES	FORMAT	[UNTIL]</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">For example:</p>
<div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent Li">
<pre>Zone	Asia/Amman	2:00	Jordan	EE%sT	2017 Oct 27 01:00</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The fields that make up a zone line are:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>NAME</dt>
  <dd>The name of the timezone. This is the name used in creating the time
      conversion information file for the timezone. It should not contain a file
      name component &#x201C;.&#x201D; or &#x201C;..&#x201D;; a file name
      component is a maximal substring that does not contain
    &#x201C;/&#x201D;.</dd>
  <dt>STDOFF</dt>
  <dd>The amount of time to add to UT to get standard time, without any
      adjustment for daylight saving. This field has the same format as the
      <var class="Ar">AT</var> and <var class="Ar">SAVE</var> fields of rule
      lines, except without suffix letters; begin the field with a minus sign if
      time must be subtracted from UT.</dd>
  <dt>RULES</dt>
  <dd>The name of the rules that apply in the timezone or, alternatively, a
      field in the same format as a rule-line SAVE column, giving the amount of
      time to be added to local standard time and whether the resulting time is
      standard or daylight saving. If this field is
      &#x2018;<code class="Li">-</code>&#x2019; then standard time always
      applies. When an amount of time is given, only the sum of standard time
      and this amount matters.</dd>
  <dt>FORMAT</dt>
  <dd>The format for time zone abbreviations. The pair of characters
      &#x2018;<code class="Li">%s</code>&#x2019; is used to show where the
      &#x201C;variable part&#x201D; of the time zone abbreviation goes.
      Alternatively, a format can use the pair of characters
      &#x2018;<code class="Li">%z</code>&#x2019; to stand for the UT offset in
      the form <var class="Ar">&#x00B1; hh</var>, <var class="Ar">&#x00B1;
      hhmm</var>, or <var class="Ar">&#x00B1; hhmmss</var>, using the shortest
      form that does not lose information, where <var class="Ar">hh</var>,
      <var class="Ar">mm</var>, and <var class="Ar">ss</var> are the hours,
      minutes, and seconds east (+) or west (-) of UT. Alternatively, a slash
      (/) separates standard and daylight abbreviations. To conform to POSIX, a
      time zone abbreviation should contain only alphanumeric ASCII characters,
      &#x2018;<code class="Li">+</code>&#x2019; and
      &#x2018;<code class="Li">-</code>&#x2019;. By convention, the time zone
      abbreviation &#x2018;<code class="Li">-00</code>&#x2019; is a placeholder
      that means local time is unspecified.</dd>
  <dt>UNTIL</dt>
  <dd>The time at which the UT offset or the rule(s) change for a location. It
      takes the form of one to four fields <var class="Ar">YEAR</var>
      [<var class="Ar">MONTH</var> [<var class="Ar">DAY</var>
      [<var class="Ar">TIME</var>]]]. If this is specified, the time zone
      information is generated from the given UT offset and rule change until
      the time specified, which is interpreted using the rules in effect just
      before the transition. The month, day, and time of day have the same
      format as the <var class="Ar">IN</var>, <var class="Ar">ON</var>, and
      <var class="Ar">AT</var> fields of a rule; trailing fields can be omitted,
      and default to the earliest possible value for the missing fields. The
      next line must be a &#x201C;continuation&#x201D; line; this has the same
      form as a zone line except that the string &#x201C;Zone&#x201D; and the
      name are omitted, as the continuation line will place information starting
      at the time specified as the &#x201C;until&#x201D; information in the
      previous line in the file used by the previous line. Continuation lines
      may contain &#x201C;until&#x201D; information, just as zone lines do,
      indicating that the next line is a further continuation.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">If a zone changes at the same instant that a rule would otherwise
    take effect in the earlier zone or continuation line, the rule is ignored. A
    zone or continuation line <var class="Ar">L</var> with a named rule set
    starts with standard time by default: that is, any of <var class="Ar">L
    's</var> timestamps preceding <var class="Ar">L 's</var> earliest rule use
    the rule in effect after <var class="Ar">L 's</var> first transition into
    standard time. In a single zone it is an error if two rules take effect at
    the same instant, or if two zone changes take effect at the same
  instant.</p>
<p class="Pp">If a continuation line subtracts <var class="Ar">N</var> seconds
    from the UT offset after a transition that would be interpreted to be later
    if using the continuation line's UT offset and rules, the
    &#x201C;until&#x201D; time of the previous zone or continuation line is
    interpreted according to the continuation line's UT offset and rules, and
    any rule that would otherwise take effect in the next
    <var class="Ar">N</var> seconds is instead assumed to take effect
    simultaneously. For example:</p>
<div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent Li">
<pre># Rule	NAME	FROM	TO		IN	ON	AT	SAVE	LETTER/S
Rule	US	1967	2006	-	Oct	lastSun	2:00	0	S
Rule	US	1967	1973	-	Apr	lastSun	2:00	1:00	D

Zone&#x00A0;&#x00A0;America/Menominee	5:00		EST	1973 Apr 29 2:00
	6:00	US	C%sT</pre>
</div>
Here, an incorrect reading would be there were two clock changes on 1973-04-29,
  the first from 02:00 EST (-05) to 01:00 CST (-06), and the second an hour
  later from 02:00 CST (-06) to 03:00 CDT (-05). However,
  <code class="Nm">zic</code> interprets this more sensibly as a single
  transition from 02:00 CST (-05) to 02:00 CDT (-05).
<p class="Pp">A link line has the form</p>
<div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent Li">
<pre>Link	TARGET	LINK-NAME</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">For example:</p>
<div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent Li">
<pre>Link	Europe/Istanbul	Asia/Istanbul</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The <var class="Ar">TARGET</var> field should appear as the
    <var class="Ar">NAME</var> field in some zone line or as the
    <var class="Ar">LINK-NAME</var> field in some link line. The
    <var class="Ar">LINK-NAME</var> field is used as an alternative name for
    that zone; it has the same syntax as a zone line's
    <var class="Ar">NAME</var> field. Links can chain together, although the
    behavior is unspecified if a chain of one or more links does not terminate
    in a Zone name. A link line can appear before the line that defines the link
    target. For example:</p>
<div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent Li">
<pre>Link	Greenwich	G_M_T
Link	Etc/GMT	Greenwich
Zone	Etc/GMT&#x00A0;&#x00A0;0&#x00A0;&#x00A0;-&#x00A0;&#x00A0;GMT</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The two links are chained together, and G_M_T, Greenwich, and
    Etc/GMT all name the same zone.</p>
<p class="Pp">Except for continuation lines, lines may appear in any order in
    the input. However, the behavior is unspecified if multiple zone or link
    lines define the same name.</p>
<p class="Pp">The file that describes leap seconds can have leap lines and an
    expiration line. Leap lines have the following form:</p>
<div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent Li">
<pre>Leap	YEAR	MONTH	DAY	HH:MM:SS	CORR	R/S</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">For example:</p>
<div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent Li">
<pre>Leap	2016	Dec	31	23:59:60	+	S</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The <var class="Ar">YEAR</var>, <var class="Ar">MONTH</var>,
    <var class="Ar">DAY</var>, and <var class="Ar">HH:MM:SS</var> fields tell
    when the leap second happened. The <var class="Ar">CORR</var> field should
    be &#x2018;<code class="Li">+</code>&#x2019; if a second was added or
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">-</code>&#x2019; if a second was skipped. The
    <var class="Ar">R/S</var> field should be (an abbreviation of)
    &#x201C;Stationary&#x201D; if the leap second time given by the other fields
    should be interpreted as UTC or (an abbreviation of) &#x201C;Rolling&#x201D;
    if the leap second time given by the other fields should be interpreted as
    local (wall clock) time.</p>
<p class="Pp">Rolling leap seconds were implemented back when it was not clear
    whether common practice was rolling or stationary, with concerns that one
    would see Times Square ball drops where there'd be a &#x201C;3... 2... 1...
    leap... Happy New Year&#x201D; countdown, placing the leap second at
    midnight New York time rather than midnight UTC. However, this countdown
    style does not seem to have caught on, which means rolling leap seconds are
    not used in practice; also, they are not supported if the
    <code class="Fl">-r</code> option is used.</p>
<p class="Pp">The expiration line, if present, has the form:</p>
<div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent Li">
<pre>Expires	YEAR	MONTH	DAY	HH:MM:SS</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">For example:</p>
<div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent Li">
<pre>Expires	2020	Dec	28	00:00:00</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The <var class="Ar">YEAR</var>, <var class="Ar">MONTH</var>,
    <var class="Ar">DAY</var>, and <var class="Ar">HH:MM:SS</var> fields give
    the expiration timestamp in UTC for the leap second table.</p>

</div>
<p class="Pp">In this example, the EU rules are for the European Union and for
    its predecessor organization, the European Communities. The timezone is
    named Europe/Zurich and it has the alias Europe/Vaduz. This example says
    that Zurich was 34 minutes and 8 seconds east of UT until 1853-07-16 at
    00:00, when the legal offset was changed to
    7&#x00B0;26&#x2032;22.50&#x2033;, which works out to 0:29:45.50;
    <code class="Nm">zic</code> treats this by rounding it to 0:29:46. After
    1894-06-01 at 00:00 the UT offset became one hour and Swiss daylight saving
    rules (defined with lines beginning with &#x201C;Rule Swiss&#x201D;) apply.
    From 1981 to the present, EU daylight saving rules have applied, and the UTC
    offset has remained at one hour.</p>
<p class="Pp">In 1941 and 1942, daylight saving time applied from the first
    Monday in May at 01:00 to the first Monday in October at 02:00. The pre-1981
    EU daylight-saving rules have no effect here, but are included for
    completeness. Since 1981, daylight saving has begun on the last Sunday in
    March at 01:00 UTC. Until 1995 it ended the last Sunday in September at
    01:00 UTC, but this changed to the last Sunday in October starting in
  1996.</p>
<p class="Pp">For purposes of display, &#x201C;LMT&#x201D; and
    &#x201C;BMT&#x201D; were initially used, respectively. Since Swiss rules and
    later EU rules were applied, the time zone abbreviation has been CET for
    standard time and CEST for daylight saving time.</p>
