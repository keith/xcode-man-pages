<b>pcap_next_ex()</b> reads the next packet and returns a success/failure
  indication. If the packet was read without problems, the pointer pointed to by
  the <i>pkt_header</i> argument is set to point to the <i>pcap_pkthdr</i>
  struct for the packet, and the pointer pointed to by the <i>pkt_data</i>
  argument is set to point to the data in the packet. The <i>struct
  pcap_pkthdr</i> and the packet data are not to be freed by the caller, and are
  not guaranteed to be valid after the next call to <b>pcap_next_ex()</b>,
  <b>pcap_next()</b>, <b>pcap_loop()</b>, or <b>pcap_dispatch()</b>; if the code
  needs them to remain valid, it must make a copy of them.
<p class="Pp"><b>pcap_next()</b> reads the next packet (by calling
    <b>pcap_dispatch()</b> with a <i>cnt</i> of 1) and returns a <i>u_char</i>
    pointer to the data in that packet. The packet data is not to be freed by
    the caller, and is not guaranteed to be valid after the next call to
    <b>pcap_next_ex()</b>, <b>pcap_next()</b>, <b>pcap_loop()</b>, or
    <b>pcap_dispatch()</b>; if the code needs it to remain valid, it must make a
    copy of it. The <i>pcap_pkthdr</i> structure pointed to by <i>h</i> is
    filled in with the appropriate values for the packet.</p>
<p class="Pp">The bytes of data from the packet begin with a link-layer header.
    The format of the link-layer header is indicated by the return value of the
    <b>pcap_datalink()</b> routine when handed the <b>pcap_t</b> value also
    passed to <b>pcap_loop()</b> or <b>pcap_dispatch()</b>.
    <i>http://www.tcpdump.org/linktypes.html</i> lists the values
    <b>pcap_datalink()</b> can return and describes the packet formats that
    correspond to those values. The value it returns will be valid for all
    packets received unless and until <b>pcap_set_datalink()</b> is called;
    after a successful call to <b>pcap_set_datalink()</b>, all subsequent
    packets will have a link-layer header of the type specified by the
    link-layer header type value passed to <b>pcap_set_datalink()</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Do <b>NOT</b> assume that the packets for a given capture or
    ``savefile`` will have any given link-layer header type, such as
    <b>DLT_EN10MB</b> for Ethernet. For example, the &quot;any&quot; device on
    Linux will have a link-layer header type of <b>DLT_LINUX_SLL</b> even if all
    devices on the system at the time the &quot;any&quot; device is opened have
    some other data link type, such as <b>DLT_EN10MB</b> for Ethernet.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="RETURN_VALUE"><a class="permalink" href="#RETURN_VALUE">RETURN
  VALUE</a></h1>
<b>pcap_next_ex()</b> returns 1 if the packet was read without problems, 0 if
  packets are being read from a live capture and the timeout expired, -1 if an
  error occurred while reading the packet, and -2 if packets are being read from
  a ``savefile'' and there are no more packets to read from the savefile. If -1
  is returned, <b>pcap_geterr()</b> or <b>pcap_perror()</b> may be called with
  <i>p</i> as an argument to fetch or display the error text.
<p class="Pp"><b>pcap_next()</b> returns a pointer to the packet data on
    success, and returns <b>NULL</b> if an error occurred, or if no packets were
    read from a live capture (if, for example, they were discarded because they
    didn't pass the packet filter, or if, on platforms that support a read
    timeout that starts before any packets arrive, the timeout expires before
    any packets arrive, or if the file descriptor for the capture device is in
    non-blocking mode and no packets were available to be read), or if no more
    packets are available in a ``savefile.'' Unfortunately, there is no way to
    determine whether an error occurred or not.</p>
