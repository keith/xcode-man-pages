perlrebackslash - Perl Regular Expression Backslash Sequences and Escapes
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
The top level documentation about Perl regular expressions is found in perlre.
<p class="Pp">This document describes all backslash and escape sequences. After
    explaining the role of the backslash, it lists all the sequences that have a
    special meaning in Perl regular expressions (in alphabetical order), then
    describes each of them.</p>
<p class="Pp">Most sequences are described in detail in different documents; the
    primary purpose of this document is to have a quick reference guide
    describing all backslash and escape sequences.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="The_backslash"><a class="permalink" href="#The_backslash">The
  backslash</a></h2>
In a regular expression, the backslash can perform one of two tasks: it either
  takes away the special meaning of the character following it (for instance,
  <span class="Li">&quot;\|&quot;</span> matches a vertical bar, it's not an
  alternation), or it is the start of a backslash or escape sequence.
<p class="Pp">The rules determining what it is are quite simple: if the
    character following the backslash is an ASCII punctuation (non-word)
    character (that is, anything that is not a letter, digit, or underscore),
    then the backslash just takes away any special meaning of the character
    following it.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the character following the backslash is an ASCII letter or an
    ASCII digit, then the sequence may be special; if so, it's listed below. A
    few letters have not been used yet, so escaping them with a backslash
    doesn't change them to be special. A future version of Perl may assign a
    special meaning to them, so if you have warnings turned on, Perl issues a
    warning if you use such a sequence. [1].</p>
<p class="Pp">It is however guaranteed that backslash or escape sequences never
    have a punctuation character following the backslash, not now, and not in a
    future version of Perl 5. So it is safe to put a backslash in front of a
    non-word character.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that the backslash itself is special; if you want to match a
    backslash, you have to escape the backslash with a backslash:
    <span class="Li">&quot;/\\/&quot;</span> matches a single backslash.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>[1]</dt>
  <dd>There is one exception. If you use an alphanumeric character as the
      delimiter of your pattern (which you probably shouldn't do for readability
      reasons), you have to escape the delimiter if you want to match it. Perl
      won't warn then. See also &quot;Gory details of parsing quoted
      constructs&quot; in perlop.</dd>

<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>

</pre>
<p class="Pp"><i>Control characters</i></p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;\c&quot;</span> is used to denote a control
    character; the character following <span class="Li">&quot;\c&quot;</span>
    determines the value of the construct. For example the value of
    <span class="Li">&quot;\cA&quot;</span> is <span class="Li">chr(1)</span>,
    and the value of <span class="Li">&quot;\cb&quot;</span> is
    <span class="Li">chr(2)</span>, etc. The gory details are in &quot;Regexp
    Quote-Like Operators&quot; in perlop. A complete list of what
    <span class="Li">chr(1)</span>, etc. means for ASCII and EBCDIC platforms is
    in &quot;OPERATOR DIFFERENCES&quot; in perlebcdic.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that <span class="Li">&quot;\c\&quot;</span> alone at the end
    of a regular expression (or doubled-quoted string) is not valid. The
    backslash must be followed by another character. That is,
    <span class="Li">&quot;\c\</span><i>X</i><span class="Li">&quot;</span>
    means <span class="Li">&quot;chr(28) .
    '</span><i>X</i><span class="Li">'&quot;</span> for all characters
  <i>X</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">To write platform-independent code, you must use
    <span class="Li">&quot;\N{</span><i>NAME</i><span class="Li">}&quot;</span>
    instead, like <span class="Li">&quot;\N{ESCAPE}&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;\N{U+001B}&quot;</span>, see charnames.</p>
<p class="Pp">Mnemonic: <i>c</i>ontrol character.</p>
<p class="Pp">Example</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
 $str =~ /\cK/;  # Matches if $str contains a vertical tab (control-K).
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><i>Named or numbered characters and character sequences</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Unicode characters have a Unicode name and numeric code point
    (ordinal) value. Use the <span class="Li">&quot;\N{}&quot;</span> construct
    to specify a character by either of these values. Certain sequences of
    characters also have names.</p>
<p class="Pp">To specify by name, the name of the character or character
    sequence goes between the curly braces.</p>
<p class="Pp">To specify a character by Unicode code point, use the form
    <span class="Li">&quot;\N{U+</span><i>code</i>
    <i>point</i><span class="Li">}&quot;</span>, where <i>code point</i> is a
    number in hexadecimal that gives the code point that Unicode has assigned to
    the desired character. It is customary but not required to use leading zeros
    to pad the number to 4 digits. Thus
    <span class="Li">&quot;\N{U+0041}&quot;</span> means
    <span class="Li">&quot;LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A&quot;</span>, and you will
    rarely see it written without the two leading zeros.
    <span class="Li">&quot;\N{U+0041}&quot;</span> means &quot;A&quot; even on
    EBCDIC machines (where the ordinal value of &quot;A&quot; is not 0x41).</p>
<p class="Pp">It is even possible to give your own names to characters and
    character sequences by using the charnames module. These custom names are
    lexically scoped, and so a given code point may have different names in
    different scopes. The name used is what is in effect at the time the
    <span class="Li">&quot;\N{}&quot;</span> is expanded. For patterns in
    double-quotish context, that means at the time the pattern is parsed. But
    for patterns that are delimitted by single quotes, the expansion is deferred
    until pattern compilation time, which may very well have a different
    <span class="Li">&quot;charnames&quot;</span> translator in effect.</p>
<p class="Pp">(There is an expanded internal form that you may see in debug
    output: <span class="Li">&quot;\N{U+</span><i>code
    point</i><span class="Li">.</span><i>code
    point</i><span class="Li">...}&quot;</span>. The
    <span class="Li">&quot;...&quot;</span> means any number of these <i>code
    point</i>s separated by dots. This represents the sequence formed by the
    characters. This is an internal form only, subject to change, and you should
    not try to use it yourself.)</p>
<p class="Pp">Mnemonic: <i>N</i>amed character.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that a character or character sequence expressed as a named
    or numbered character is considered a character without special meaning by
    the regex engine, and will match &quot;as is&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">Example</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
 $str =~ /\N{THAI CHARACTER SO SO}/;  # Matches the Thai SO SO character

 use charnames 'Cyrillic';            # Loads Cyrillic names.
 $str =~ /\N{ZHE}\N{KA}/;             # Match &quot;ZHE&quot; followed by &quot;KA&quot;.
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><i>Octal escapes</i></p>
<p class="Pp">There are two forms of octal escapes. Each is used to specify a
    character by its code point specified in octal notation.</p>
<p class="Pp">One form, available starting in Perl 5.14 looks like
    <span class="Li">&quot;\o{...}&quot;</span>, where the dots represent one or
    more octal digits. It can be used for any Unicode character.</p>
<p class="Pp">It was introduced to avoid the potential problems with the other
    form, available in all Perls. That form consists of a backslash followed by
    three octal digits. One problem with this form is that it can look exactly
    like an old-style backreference (see &quot;Disambiguation rules between
    old-style octal escapes and backreferences&quot; below.) You can avoid this
    by making the first of the three digits always a zero, but that makes \077
    the largest code point specifiable.</p>
<p class="Pp">In some contexts, a backslash followed by two or even one octal
    digits may be interpreted as an octal escape, sometimes with a warning, and
    because of some bugs, sometimes with surprising results. Also, if you are
    creating a regex out of smaller snippets concatenated together, and you use
    fewer than three digits, the beginning of one snippet may be interpreted as
    adding digits to the ending of the snippet before it. See &quot;Absolute
    referencing&quot; for more discussion and examples of the snippet
  problem.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that a character expressed as an octal escape is considered a
    character without special meaning by the regex engine, and will match
    &quot;as is&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">To summarize, the <span class="Li">&quot;\o{}&quot;</span> form is
    always safe to use, and the other form is safe to use for code points
    through \077 when you use exactly three digits to specify them.</p>
<p class="Pp">Mnemonic: <i>0</i>ctal or <i>o</i>ctal.</p>
<p class="Pp">Examples (assuming an ASCII platform)</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>

</pre>
<p class="Pp">Disambiguation rules between old-style octal escapes and
    backreferences</p>
<p class="Pp">Octal escapes of the <span class="Li">&quot;\000&quot;</span> form
    outside of bracketed character classes potentially clash with old-style
    backreferences (see &quot;Absolute referencing&quot; below). They both
    consist of a backslash followed by numbers. So Perl has to use heuristics to
    determine whether it is a backreference or an octal escape. Perl uses the
    following rules to disambiguate:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>1.</dt>
  <dd>If the backslash is followed by a single digit, it's a backreference.</dd>
  <dt>2.</dt>
  <dd>If the first digit following the backslash is a 0, it's an octal
    escape.</dd>
  <dt>3.</dt>
  <dd>If the number following the backslash is N (in decimal), and Perl already
      has seen N capture groups, Perl considers this a backreference. Otherwise,
      it considers it an octal escape. If N has more than three digits, Perl
      takes only the first three for the octal escape; the rest are matched as
      is.
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
 my $pat  = &quot;(&quot; x 999;
    $pat .= &quot;a&quot;;
    $pat .= &quot;)&quot; x 999;
 /^($pat)\1000$/;   #  Matches 'aa'; there are 1000 capture groups.
 /^$pat\1000$/;     #  Matches 'a@0'; there are 999 capture groups
                    #  and \1000 is seen as \100 (a '@') and a '0'.
    </pre>
  </dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">You can force a backreference interpretation always by using the
    <span class="Li">&quot;\g{...}&quot;</span> form. You can the force an octal
    interpretation always by using the
    <span class="Li">&quot;\o{...}&quot;</span> form, or for numbers up through
    \077 (= 63 decimal), by using three digits, beginning with a
  &quot;0&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Hexadecimal escapes</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Like octal escapes, there are two forms of hexadecimal escapes,
    but both start with the sequence <span class="Li">&quot;\x&quot;</span>.
    This is followed by either exactly two hexadecimal digits forming a number,
    or a hexadecimal number of arbitrary length surrounded by curly braces. The
    hexadecimal number is the code point of the character you want to
  express.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that a character expressed as one of these escapes is
    considered a character without special meaning by the regex engine, and will
    match &quot;as is&quot;.</p>

A number of backslash sequences have to do with changing the character, or
  characters following them. <span class="Li">&quot;\l&quot;</span> will
  lowercase the character following it, while
  <span class="Li">&quot;\u&quot;</span> will uppercase (or, more accurately,
  titlecase) the character following it. They provide functionality similar to
  the functions <span class="Li">&quot;lcfirst&quot;</span> and

<p class="Pp">To uppercase or lowercase several characters, one might want to

Perl regular expressions have a large range of character classes. Some of the
  character classes are written as a backslash sequence. We will briefly discuss
  those here; full details of character classes can be found in perlrecharclass.
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;\w&quot;</span> is a character class that
    matches any single <i>word</i> character (letters, digits, Unicode marks,
    and connector punctuation (like the underscore)).
    <span class="Li">&quot;\d&quot;</span> is a character class that matches any
    decimal digit, while the character class
    <span class="Li">&quot;\s&quot;</span> matches any whitespace character. New
    in perl 5.10.0 are the classes <span class="Li">&quot;\h&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;\v&quot;</span> which match horizontal and vertical
    whitespace characters.</p>
<p class="Pp">The exact set of characters matched by
    <span class="Li">&quot;\d&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;\s&quot;</span>, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;\w&quot;</span> varies depending on various pragma
    and regular expression modifiers. It is possible to restrict the match to
    the ASCII range by using the <span class="Li">&quot;/a&quot;</span> regular
    expression modifier. See perlrecharclass.</p>
<p class="Pp">The uppercase variants (<span class="Li">&quot;\W&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;\D&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;\S&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;\H&quot;</span>, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;\V&quot;</span>) are character classes that match,
    respectively, any character that isn't a word character, digit, whitespace,
    horizontal whitespace, or vertical whitespace.</p>
<p class="Pp">Mnemonics: <i>w</i>ord, <i>d</i>igit, <i>s</i>pace,

<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;\pP&quot;</span> (where
    <span class="Li">&quot;P&quot;</span> is a single letter) and
    <span class="Li">&quot;\p{Property}&quot;</span> are used to match a
    character that matches the given Unicode property; properties include things
    like &quot;letter&quot;, or &quot;thai character&quot;. Capitalizing the
    sequence to <span class="Li">&quot;\PP&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;\P{Property}&quot;</span> make the sequence match a
    character that doesn't match the given Unicode property. For more details,

<h2 class="Ss" id="Referencing"><a class="permalink" href="#Referencing">Referencing</a></h2>
If capturing parenthesis are used in a regular expression, we can refer to the
  part of the source string that was matched, and match exactly the same thing.
  There are three ways of referring to such <i>backreference</i>: absolutely,
  relatively, and by name.
<p class="Pp"><i>Absolute referencing</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Either
    <span class="Li">&quot;\g</span><i>N</i><span class="Li">&quot;</span>
    (starting in Perl 5.10.0), or
    <span class="Li">&quot;\</span><i>N</i><span class="Li">&quot;</span>
    (old-style) where <i>N</i> is a positive (unsigned) decimal number of any
    length is an absolute reference to a capturing group.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>N</i> refers to the Nth set of parentheses, so
    <span class="Li">&quot;\g</span><i>N</i><span class="Li">&quot;</span>
    refers to whatever has been matched by that set of parentheses. Thus
    <span class="Li">&quot;\g1&quot;</span> refers to the first capture group in
    the regex.</p>
<p class="Pp">The
    <span class="Li">&quot;\g</span><i>N</i><span class="Li">&quot;</span> form
    can be equivalently written as
    <span class="Li">&quot;\g{</span><i>N</i><span class="Li">}&quot;</span>
    which avoids ambiguity when building a regex by concatenating shorter
    strings. Otherwise if you had a regex
    <span class="Li">&quot;qr/$a$b/&quot;</span>, and <span class="Li">$a</span>
    contained <span class="Li">&quot;\g1&quot;</span>, and
    <span class="Li">$b</span> contained <span class="Li">&quot;37&quot;</span>,
    you would get <span class="Li">&quot;/\g137/&quot;</span> which is probably
    not what you intended.</p>
<p class="Pp">In the
    <span class="Li">&quot;\</span><i>N</i><span class="Li">&quot;</span> form,
    <i>N</i> must not begin with a &quot;0&quot;, and there must be at least
    <i>N</i> capturing groups, or else <i>N</i> is considered an octal escape
    (but something like <span class="Li">&quot;\18&quot;</span> is the same as
    <span class="Li">&quot;\0018&quot;</span>; that is, the octal escape
    <span class="Li">&quot;\001&quot;</span> followed by a literal digit
    <span class="Li">&quot;8&quot;</span>).</p>
<p class="Pp">Mnemonic: <i>g</i>roup.</p>
<p class="Pp">Examples</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
 /(\w+) \g1/;    # Finds a duplicated word, (e.g. &quot;cat cat&quot;).
 /(\w+) \1/;     # Same thing; written old-style.
 /(.)(.)\g2\g1/;  # Match a four letter palindrome (e.g. &quot;ABBA&quot;).
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><i>Relative referencing</i></p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;\g-</span><i>N</i><span class="Li">&quot;</span>
    (starting in Perl 5.10.0) is used for relative addressing. (It can be
    written as
    <span class="Li">&quot;\g{-</span><i>N</i><span class="Li">&quot;</span>.)
    It refers to the <i>N</i>th group before the
    <span class="Li">&quot;\g{-</span>
  <i>N</i><span class="Li">}&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The big advantage of this form is that it makes it much easier to
    write patterns with references that can be interpolated in larger patterns,
    even if the larger pattern also contains capture groups.</p>
<p class="Pp">Examples</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
 /(A)        # Group 1
  (          # Group 2
    (B)      # Group 3
    \g{-1}   # Refers to group 3 (B)
    \g{-3}   # Refers to group 1 (A)
  )
 /x;         # Matches &quot;ABBA&quot;.

 my $qr = qr /(.)(.)\g{-2}\g{-1}/;  # Matches 'abab', 'cdcd', etc.
 /$qr$qr/                           # Matches 'ababcdcd'.
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><i>Named referencing</i></p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;\g{</span><i>name</i><span class="Li">}&quot;</span>
    (starting in Perl 5.10.0) can be used to back refer to a named capture
    group, dispensing completely with having to think about capture buffer
    positions.</p>
<p class="Pp">To be compatible with .Net regular expressions,
    <span class="Li">&quot;\g{name}&quot;</span> may also be written as
    <span class="Li">&quot;\k{name}&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;\k&lt;name&gt;&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;\k'name'&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">To prevent any ambiguity, <i>name</i> must not start with a digit
    nor contain a hyphen.</p>
<p class="Pp">Examples</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
 /(?&lt;word&gt;\w+) \g{word}/ # Finds duplicated word, (e.g. &quot;cat cat&quot;)
 /(?&lt;word&gt;\w+) \k{word}/ # Same.
 /(?&lt;word&gt;\w+) \k&lt;word&gt;/ # Same.
 /(?&lt;letter1&gt;.)(?&lt;letter2&gt;.)\g{letter2}\g{letter1}/
                         # Match a four letter palindrome (e.g. &quot;ABBA&quot;)

<h2 class="Ss" id="Assertions"><a class="permalink" href="#Assertions">Assertions</a></h2>
Assertions are conditions that have to be true; they don't actually match parts
  of the substring. There are six assertions that are written as backslash
  sequences.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>\A</dt>
  <dd><span class="Li">&quot;\A&quot;</span> only matches at the beginning of
      the string. If the <span class="Li">&quot;/m&quot;</span> modifier isn't
      used, then <span class="Li">&quot;/\A/&quot;</span> is equivalent to
      <span class="Li">&quot;/^/&quot;</span>. However, if the
      <span class="Li">&quot;/m&quot;</span> modifier is used, then
      <span class="Li">&quot;/^/&quot;</span> matches internal newlines, but the
      meaning of <span class="Li">&quot;/\A/&quot;</span> isn't changed by the
      <span class="Li">&quot;/m&quot;</span> modifier.
      <span class="Li">&quot;\A&quot;</span> matches at the beginning of the
      string regardless whether the <span class="Li">&quot;/m&quot;</span>
      modifier is used.</dd>
  <dt>\z, \Z</dt>
  <dd><span class="Li">&quot;\z&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;\Z&quot;</span> match at the end of the string. If
      the <span class="Li">&quot;/m&quot;</span> modifier isn't used, then
      <span class="Li">&quot;/\Z/&quot;</span> is equivalent to
      <span class="Li">&quot;/$/&quot;</span>; that is, it matches at the end of
      the string, or one before the newline at the end of the string. If the
      <span class="Li">&quot;/m&quot;</span> modifier is used, then
      <span class="Li">&quot;/$/&quot;</span> matches at internal newlines, but
      the meaning of <span class="Li">&quot;/\Z/&quot;</span> isn't changed by
      the <span class="Li">&quot;/m&quot;</span> modifier.
      <span class="Li">&quot;\Z&quot;</span> matches at the end of the string
      (or just before a trailing newline) regardless whether the
      <span class="Li">&quot;/m&quot;</span> modifier is used.
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;\z&quot;</span> is just like
        <span class="Li">&quot;\Z&quot;</span>, except that it does not match
        before a trailing newline. <span class="Li">&quot;\z&quot;</span>
        matches at the end of the string only, regardless of the modifiers used,
        and not just before a newline. It is how to anchor the match to the true
        end of the string under all conditions.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>\G</dt>
  <dd><span class="Li">&quot;\G&quot;</span> is usually used only in combination
      with the <span class="Li">&quot;/g&quot;</span> modifier. If the
      <span class="Li">&quot;/g&quot;</span> modifier is used and the match is
      done in scalar context, Perl remembers where in the source string the last
      match ended, and the next time, it will start the match from where it
      ended the previous time.
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;\G&quot;</span> matches the point where
        the previous match on that string ended, or the beginning of that string
        if there was no previous match.</p>

  </dd>
  <dt>\b{}, \b, \B{}, \B</dt>
  <dd><span class="Li">&quot;\b{...}&quot;</span>, available starting in v5.22,
      matches a boundary (between two characters, or before the first character
      of the string, or after the final character of the string) based on the
      Unicode rules for the boundary type specified inside the braces. The
      boundary types are given a few paragraphs below.
      <span class="Li">&quot;\B{...}&quot;</span> matches at any place between
      characters where <span class="Li">&quot;\b{...}&quot;</span> of the same
      type doesn't match.
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;\b&quot;</span> when not immediately
        followed by a <span class="Li">&quot;{&quot;</span> matches at any place
        between a word (something matched by
        <span class="Li">&quot;\w&quot;</span>) and a non-word character
        (<span class="Li">&quot;\W&quot;</span>);
        <span class="Li">&quot;\B&quot;</span> when not immediately followed by
        a <span class="Li">&quot;{&quot;</span> matches at any place between
        characters where <span class="Li">&quot;\b&quot;</span> doesn't match.
        To get better word matching of natural language text, see
        &quot;\b{wb}&quot; below.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;\b&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;\B&quot;</span> assume there's a non-word
        character before the beginning and after the end of the source string;
        so <span class="Li">&quot;\b&quot;</span> will match at the beginning
        (or end) of the source string if the source string begins (or ends) with
        a word character. Otherwise, <span class="Li">&quot;\B&quot;</span> will
        match.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Do not use something like
        <span class="Li">&quot;\b=head\d\b&quot;</span> and expect it to match
        the beginning of a line. It can't, because for there to be a boundary
        before the non-word &quot;=&quot;, there must be a word character
        immediately previous. All plain <span class="Li">&quot;\b&quot;</span>
        and <span class="Li">&quot;\B&quot;</span> boundary determinations look
        for word characters alone, not for non-word characters nor for string
        ends. It may help to understand how
        <span class="Li">&quot;\b&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;\B&quot;</span> work by equating them as
      follows:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    \b  really means    (?:(?&lt;=\w)(?!\w)|(?&lt;!\w)(?=\w))
    \B  really means    (?:(?&lt;=\w)(?=\w)|(?&lt;!\w)(?!\w))
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">In contrast, <span class="Li">&quot;\b{...}&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;\B{...}&quot;</span> may or may not match at the
        beginning and end of the line, depending on the boundary type. These
        implement the Unicode default boundaries, specified in
        &lt;http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr14/&gt; and
        &lt;http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr29/&gt;. The boundary types
      are:</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>&quot;\b{gcb}&quot; or &quot;\b{g}&quot;</dt>
  <dd>This matches a Unicode &quot;Grapheme Cluster Boundary&quot;. (Actually
      Perl always uses the improved &quot;extended&quot; grapheme
      cluster&quot;). These are explained below under
      &quot;<span class="Li">&quot;\X&quot;</span>&quot;. In fact,
      <span class="Li">&quot;\X&quot;</span> is another way to get the same
      functionality. It is equivalent to
      <span class="Li">&quot;/.+?\b{gcb}/&quot;</span>. Use whichever is most
      convenient for your situation.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;\b{lb}&quot;</dt>
  <dd>This matches according to the default Unicode Line Breaking Algorithm
      (&lt;http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr14/&gt;), as customized in that
      document (Example 7 of revision 35
      &lt;http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr14/tr14-35.html#Example7&gt;) for
      better handling of numeric expressions.
    <p class="Pp">This is suitable for many purposes, but the Unicode::LineBreak
        module is available on CPAN that provides many more features, including
        customization.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>&quot;\b{sb}&quot;</dt>
  <dd>This matches a Unicode &quot;Sentence Boundary&quot;. This is an aid to
      parsing natural language sentences. It gives good, but imperfect results.
      For example, it thinks that &quot;Mr. Smith&quot; is two sentences. More
      details are at &lt;http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr29/&gt;. Note also
      that it thinks that anything matching &quot;\R&quot; (except form feed and
      vertical tab) is a sentence boundary.
      <span class="Li">&quot;\b{sb}&quot;</span> works with text designed for
      word-processors which wrap lines automatically for display, but hard-coded
      line boundaries are considered to be essentially the ends of text blocks
      (paragraphs really), and hence the ends of sentences.
      <span class="Li">&quot;\b{sb}&quot;</span> doesn't do well with text
      containing embedded newlines, like the source text of the document you are
      reading. Such text needs to be preprocessed to get rid of the line
      separators before looking for sentence boundaries. Some people view this
      as a bug in the Unicode standard, and this behavior is quite subject to
      change in future Perl versions.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;\b{wb}&quot;</dt>
  <dd>This matches a Unicode &quot;Word Boundary&quot;, but tailored to Perl
      expectations. This gives better (though not perfect) results for natural
      language processing than plain <span class="Li">&quot;\b&quot;</span>
      (without braces) does. For example, it understands that apostrophes can be
      in the middle of words and that parentheses aren't (see the examples
      below). More details are at &lt;http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr29/&gt;.
    <p class="Pp">The current Unicode definition of a Word Boundary matches
        between every white space character. Perl tailors this, starting in
        version 5.24, to generally not break up spans of white space, just as
        plain <span class="Li">&quot;\b&quot;</span> has always functioned. This
        allows <span class="Li">&quot;\b{wb}&quot;</span> to be a drop-in
        replacement for <span class="Li">&quot;\b&quot;</span>, but with
        generally better results for natural language processing. (The exception
        to this tailoring is when a span of white space is immediately followed
        by something like U+0303, COMBINING TILDE. If the final space character
        in the span is a horizontal white space, it is broken out so that it
        attaches instead to the combining character. To be precise, if a span of
        white space that ends in a horizontal space has the character
        immediately following it have any of the Word Boundary property values
        &quot;Extend&quot;, &quot;Format&quot; or &quot;ZWJ&quot;, the boundary
        between the final horizontal space character and the rest of the span
        matches <span class="Li">&quot;\b{wb}&quot;</span>. In all other cases
        the boundary between two white space characters matches
        <span class="Li">&quot;\B{wb}&quot;</span>.)</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">It is important to realize when you use these Unicode boundaries,
    that you are taking a risk that a future version of Perl which contains a
    later version of the Unicode Standard will not work precisely the same way
    as it did when your code was written. These rules are not considered stable
    and have been somewhat more subject to change than the rest of the Standard.
    Unicode reserves the right to change them at will, and Perl reserves the
    right to update its implementation to Unicode's new rules. In the past, some
    changes have been because new characters have been added to the Standard
    which have different characteristics than all previous characters, so new
    rules are formulated for handling them. These should not cause any backward
    compatibility issues. But some changes have changed the treatment of
    existing characters because the Unicode Technical Committee has decided that
    the change is warranted for whatever reason. This could be to fix a bug, or
    because they think better results are obtained with the new rule.</p>
<p class="Pp">It is also important to realize that these are default boundary
    definitions, and that implementations may wish to tailor the results for
    particular purposes and locales. For example, some languages, such as
    Japanese and Thai, require dictionary lookup to accurately determine word
    boundaries.</p>

    <p class="Pp">fails, because the <span class="Li">&quot;\R&quot;</span>
        matches the entire string, and won't backtrack to match just the
        <span class="Li">&quot;\x0D&quot;</span>.) Since
        <span class="Li">&quot;\R&quot;</span> can match a sequence of more than
        one character, it cannot be put inside a bracketed character class;
        <span class="Li">&quot;/[\R]/&quot;</span> is an error; use
        <span class="Li">&quot;\v&quot;</span> instead.
        <span class="Li">&quot;\R&quot;</span> was introduced in perl
      5.10.0.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that this does not respect any locale that might be in
        effect; it matches according to the platform's native character set.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Mnemonic: none really. <span class="Li">&quot;\R&quot;</span>
        was picked because PCRE already uses
        <span class="Li">&quot;\R&quot;</span>, and more importantly because
        Unicode recommends such a regular expression metacharacter, and suggests
        <span class="Li">&quot;\R&quot;</span> as its notation.</p>

  <dd>This matches a Unicode <i>extended grapheme cluster</i>.
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;\X&quot;</span> matches quite well what
        normal (non-Unicode-programmer) usage would consider a single character.
        As an example, consider a G with some sort of diacritic mark, such as an
        arrow. There is no such single character in Unicode, but one can be
        composed by using a G followed by a Unicode &quot;COMBINING UPWARDS
        ARROW BELOW&quot;, and would be displayed by Unicode-aware software as
        if it were a single character.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The match is greedy and non-backtracking, so that the cluster
        is never broken up into smaller components.</p>
    <p class="Pp">See also <span class="Li">&quot;\b{gcb}&quot;</span>.</p>
