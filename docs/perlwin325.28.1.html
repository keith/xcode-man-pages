   Set up some character translations and predefined strings.  \*(-- will
   give an unbreakable dash, \*(PI will give pi, \*(L" will give a left
   double quote, and \*(R" will give a right double quote.  \*(C+ will
   give a nicer C++.  Capital omega is used to do unbreakable dashes and
   therefore won't be available.  \*(C` and \*(C' expand to `' in nroff,

perlwin32 - Perl under Windows
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="permalink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
These are instructions for building Perl under Windows 2000 and later.
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
Before you start, you should glance through the README file found in the
  top-level directory to which the Perl distribution was extracted. Make sure
  you read and understand the terms under which this software is being
  distributed.
<p class="Pp">Also make sure you read &quot;BUGS AND CAVEATS&quot; below for the
    known limitations of this port.</p>
<p class="Pp">The INSTALL file in the perl top-level has much information that
    is only relevant to people building Perl on Unix-like systems. In
    particular, you can safely ignore any information that talks about
    &quot;Configure&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">You may also want to look at one other option for building a perl
    that will work on Windows: the README.cygwin file, which give a different
    set of rules to build a perl for Windows. This method will probably enable
    you to build a more Unix-compatible perl, but you will also need to download
    and use various other build-time and run-time support software described in
    that file.</p>
<p class="Pp">This set of instructions is meant to describe a so-called
    &quot;native&quot; port of Perl to the Windows platform. This includes both
    32-bit and 64-bit Windows operating systems. The resulting Perl requires no
    additional software to run (other than what came with your operating
    system). Currently, this port is capable of using one of the following
    compilers on the Intel x86 architecture:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
      Microsoft Visual C++    version 6.0 or later
      Intel C++ Compiler      (experimental)
      Gcc by mingw.org        gcc version 3.4.5 or later
                              with runtime &lt; 3.21
      Gcc by mingw-w64.org    gcc version 4.4.3 or later
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Note that the last two of these are actually competing projects
    both delivering complete gcc toolchain for MS Windows:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>&lt;http://mingw.org&gt;</dt>
  <dd>Delivers gcc toolchain targeting 32-bit Windows platform.</dd>
  <dt>&lt;http://mingw-w64.org&gt;</dt>
  <dd>Delivers gcc toolchain targeting both 64-bit Windows and 32-bit Windows
      platforms (despite the project name &quot;mingw-w64&quot; they are not
      only 64-bit oriented). They deliver the native gcc compilers and
      cross-compilers that are also supported by perl's makefile.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The Microsoft Visual C++ compilers are also now being given away
    free. They are available as &quot;Visual C++ Toolkit 2003&quot; or
    &quot;Visual C++ 2005-2017 Express [or Community, from 2017] Edition&quot;
    (and also as part of the &quot;.NET Framework SDK&quot;) and are the same
    compilers that ship with &quot;Visual C++ .NET 2003 Professional&quot; or
    &quot;Visual C++ 2005-2017 Professional&quot; respectively.</p>
<p class="Pp">This port can also be built on IA64/AMD64 using:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
      Microsoft Platform SDK    Nov 2001 (64-bit compiler and tools)
      MinGW64 compiler (gcc version 4.4.3 or later)
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The Windows SDK can be downloaded from
    &lt;http://www.microsoft.com/&gt;. The MinGW64 compiler is available at
    &lt;http://mingw-w64.org&gt;. The latter is actually a cross-compiler
    targeting Win64. There's also a trimmed down compiler (no java, or gfortran)
    suitable for building perl available at:
    &lt;http://strawberryperl.com/package/kmx/64_gcctoolchain/&gt;</p>
<p class="Pp">NOTE: If you're using a 32-bit compiler to build perl on a 64-bit
    Windows operating system, then you should set the WIN64 environment variable
    to &quot;undef&quot;. Also, the trimmed down compiler only passes tests when
    USE_ITHREADS *= define (as opposed to undef) and when the CFG *= Debug line
    is commented out.</p>
<p class="Pp">This port fully supports MakeMaker (the set of modules that is
    used to build extensions to perl). Therefore, you should be able to build
    and install most extensions found in the CPAN sites. See &quot;Usage Hints
    for Perl on Windows&quot; below for general hints about this.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Setting_Up_Perl_on_Windows"><a class="permalink" href="#Setting_Up_Perl_on_Windows">Setting
  Up Perl on Windows</a></h2>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>Make</dt>
  <dd>You need a &quot;make&quot; program to build the sources. If you are using
      Visual C++ or the Windows SDK tools, you can use nmake supplied with
      Visual C++ or Windows SDK. You may also use, for Visual C++ or Windows
      SDK, dmake or gmake instead of nmake. dmake is open source software, but
      is not included with Visual C++ or Windows SDK. Builds using gcc need
      dmake or gmake. nmake is not supported for gcc builds. Parallel building
      is only supported with dmake and gmake, not nmake. When using dmake it is
      recommended to use dmake 4.13 or newer for parallel building. Older
      dmakes, in parallel mode, have very high CPU usage and pound the
      disk/filing system with duplicate I/O calls in an aggressive polling loop.
    <p class="Pp">A port of dmake for Windows is available from:</p>
    <p class="Pp">&lt;http://search.cpan.org/dist/dmake/&gt;</p>
    <p class="Pp">Fetch and install dmake somewhere on your path.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Command Shell</dt>
  <dd>Use the default &quot;cmd&quot; shell that comes with Windows. Some
      versions of the popular 4DOS/NT shell have incompatibilities that may
      cause you trouble. If the build fails under that shell, try building again
      with the cmd shell.
    <p class="Pp">Make sure the path to the build directory does not contain
        spaces. The build usually works in this circumstance, but some tests
        will fail.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Microsoft Visual C++</dt>
  <dd>The nmake that comes with Visual C++ will suffice for building. Visual C
      requires that certain things be set up in the console before Visual C will
      sucessfully run. To make a console box be able to run the C compiler, you
      will need to beforehand, run the
      <span class="Li">&quot;vcvars32.bat&quot;</span> file to compile for
      x86-32 and for x86-64 <span class="Li">&quot;vcvarsall.bat
      x64&quot;</span> or <span class="Li">&quot;vcvarsamd64.bat&quot;</span>.
      On a typical install of a Microsoft C compiler product, these batch files
      will already be in your <span class="Li">&quot;PATH&quot;</span>
      environment variable so you may just type them without an absolute path
      into your console. If you need to find the absolute path to the batch
      file, it is usually found somewhere like C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual
      Studio\VC98\Bin. With some newer Micrsoft C products (released after
      ~2004), the installer will put a shortcut in the start menu to launch a
      new console window with the console already set up for your target
      architecture (x86-32 or x86-64 or IA64). With the newer compilers, you may
      also use the older batch files if you choose so.</dd>
  <dt>Microsoft Visual C++ 2008-2017 Express/Community Edition</dt>
  <dd>These free versions of Visual C++ 2008-2017 Professional contain the same
      compilers and linkers that ship with the full versions, and also contain
      everything necessary to build Perl, rather than requiring a separate
      download of the Windows SDK like previous versions did.
    <p class="Pp">These packages can be downloaded by searching in the Download
        Center at
        &lt;http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/search.aspx?displaylang=en&gt;.
        (Providing exact links to these packages has proven a pointless task
        because the links keep on changing so often.)</p>
    <p class="Pp">Install Visual C++ 2008-2017 Express/Community, then setup
        your environment using, e.g.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
 C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\Common7\Tools\vsvars32.bat
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">(assuming the default installation location was chosen).</p>
    <p class="Pp">Perl should now build using the win32/Makefile. You will need
        to edit that file to set CCTYPE to one of MSVC90-MSVC141 first.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition</dt>
  <dd>This free version of Visual C++ 2005 Professional contains the same
      compiler and linker that ship with the full version, but doesn't contain
      everything necessary to build Perl.
    <p class="Pp">You will also need to download the &quot;Windows SDK&quot;
        (the &quot;Core SDK&quot; and &quot;MDAC SDK&quot; components are
        required) for more header files and libraries.</p>
    <p class="Pp">These packages can both be downloaded by searching in the
        Download Center at

        (Providing exact links to these packages has proven a pointless task
        because the links keep on changing so often.)</p>
    <p class="Pp">Try to obtain the latest version of the Windows SDK. Sometimes
        these packages contain a particular Windows OS version in their name,
        but actually work on other OS versions too. For example, the
        &quot;Windows Server 2003 R2 Platform SDK&quot; also runs on Windows XP
        SP2 and Windows 2000.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Install Visual C++ 2005 first, then the Platform SDK. Setup
        your environment as follows (assuming default installation locations
        were chosen):</p>

<div class="Bd-indent">
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>cvtres.exe is required by link.exe when using a .res file. It is actually

  </li>
  <li>setargv.obj is required to build perlglob.exe (and perl.exe if the
      USE_SETARGV option is enabled). The Platform SDK supplies this object file
      in source form in <span class="Li">%PlatformSDKDir</span>%\src\crt. Copy

  <dt>GCC</dt>

        &lt;http://www.mingw-w64.org/&gt;</p>
    <p class="Pp">You also need dmake. See &quot;Make&quot; above on how to get
        it.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that the MinGW build currently requires a MinGW runtime
        version earlier than 3.21 (check __MINGW32_MAJOR_VERSION and
        __MINGW32_MINOR_VERSION).</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note also that the C++ mode build currently fails with MinGW
        3.4.5 and 4.7.2 or later, and with MinGW64 64-bit 6.3.0 or later.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Intel C++ Compiler</dt>
  <dd>Experimental support for using Intel C++ Compiler has been added. Edit
      win32/Makefile and pick the correct CCTYPE for the Visual C that Intel C
      was installed into. Also uncomment __ICC to enable Intel C on Visual C
      support. To set up the build enviroment, from the Start Menu run IA-32
      Visual Studio 20__ mode or Intel 64 Visual Studio 20__ mode as
      appropriate. Then run nmake as usually in that prompt box.
    <p class="Pp">Only Intel C++ Compiler v12.1 has been tested. Other versions
        probably will work. Using Intel C++ Compiler instead of Visual C has the
        benefit of C99 compatibility which is needed by some CPAN XS modules,
        while maintaining compatibility with Visual C object code and Visual C
        debugging infrastructure unlike GCC.</p>

<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Make sure you are in the &quot;win32&quot; subdirectory under the perl
      toplevel. This directory contains a &quot;Makefile&quot; that will work
      with versions of nmake that come with Visual C++ or the Windows SDK, and a
      dmake &quot;makefile.mk&quot; that will work for all supported compilers.
      The defaults in the dmake makefile are setup to build using
    MinGW/gcc.</li>
  <li>Edit the makefile.mk (or Makefile, if you're using nmake) and change the
      values of INST_DRV and INST_TOP. You can also enable various build flags.
      These are explained in the makefiles.
    <p class="Pp">Note that it is generally not a good idea to try to build a
        perl with INST_DRV and INST_TOP set to a path that already exists from a
        previous build. In particular, this may cause problems with the
        lib/ExtUtils/t/Embed.t test, which attempts to build a test program and
        may end up building against the installed perl's lib/CORE directory
        rather than the one being tested.</p>
    <p class="Pp">You will have to make sure that CCTYPE is set correctly and
        that CCHOME points to wherever you installed your compiler.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If building with the cross-compiler provided by mingw-w64.org
        you'll need to uncomment the line that sets GCCCROSS in the makefile.mk.
        Do this only if it's the cross-compiler - ie only if the bin folder
        doesn't contain a gcc.exe. (The cross-compiler does not provide a
        gcc.exe, g++.exe, ar.exe, etc. Instead, all of these executables are
        prefixed with 'x86_64-w64-mingw32-'.)</p>
    <p class="Pp">The default value for CCHOME in the makefiles for Visual C++
        may not be correct for some versions. Make sure the default exists and
        is valid.</p>
    <p class="Pp">You may also need to comment out the
        <span class="Li">&quot;DELAYLOAD = ...&quot;</span> line in the Makefile
        if you're using VC++ 6.0 without the latest service pack and the linker
        reports an internal error.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you want build some core extensions statically into perl's
        dll, specify them in the STATIC_EXT macro.</p>
    <p class="Pp">NOTE: The USE_64_BIT_INT build option is not supported with
        the 32-bit Visual C++ 6.0 compiler.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Be sure to read the instructions near the top of the makefiles
        carefully.</p>

        perl.exe, perl528.dll at the perl toplevel, and various other extension
        dll's under the lib\auto directory. If the build fails for any reason,
        make sure you have done the previous steps correctly.</p>
    <p class="Pp">To try dmake's parallel mode, type &quot;dmake -P2&quot;,
        where 2, is the maximum number of parallel jobs you want to run. A
        number of things in the build process will run in parallel, but there
        are serialization points where you will see just 1 CPU maxed out. This
        is normal.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you are advanced enough with building C code, here is a
        suggestion to speed up building perl, and the later
        <span class="Li">&quot;make test&quot;</span>. Try to keep your PATH
        enviromental variable with the least number of folders possible
        (remember to keep your C compiler's folders there).
        <span class="Li">&quot;C:\WINDOWS\system32&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;C:\WINNT\system32&quot;</span> depending on your
        OS version should be first folder in PATH, since &quot;cmd.exe&quot; is
        the most commonly launched program during the build and later
      testing.</p>

Type &quot;dmake test&quot; (or &quot;nmake test&quot;). This will run most of
  the tests from the testsuite (many tests will be skipped).
<p class="Pp">There should be no test failures.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you build with Visual C++ 2013 then three tests currently may
    fail with Daylight Saving Time related problems: <i>t/io/fs.t</i>,
    <i>cpan/HTTP-Tiny/t/110_mirror.t</i> and <i>lib/File/Copy.t</i>. The
    failures are caused by bugs in the CRT in VC++ 2013 which are fixed in
    VC++2015 and later, as explained by Microsoft here:
    &lt;https://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/details/811534/utime-sometimes-fails-to-set-the-correct-file-times-in-visual-c-2013&gt;.
    In the meantime, if you need fixed <span class="Li">&quot;stat&quot;</span>
    and <span class="Li">&quot;utime&quot;</span> functions then have a look at
    the CPAN distribution Win32::UTCFileTime.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you build with certain versions (e.g. 4.8.1) of gcc from
    www.mingw.org then <i>ext/POSIX/t/time.t</i> may fail test 17 due to a known
    bug in those gcc builds: see
    &lt;http://sourceforge.net/p/mingw/bugs/2152/&gt;.</p>
<p class="Pp">Some test failures may occur if you use a command shell other than
    the native &quot;cmd.exe&quot;, or if you are building from a path that
    contains spaces. So don't do that.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you are running the tests from a emacs shell window, you may
    see failures in op/stat.t. Run &quot;dmake test-notty&quot; in that
  case.</p>
<p class="Pp">Furthermore, you should make sure that during
    <span class="Li">&quot;make test&quot;</span> you do not have any GNU tool
    packages in your path: some toolkits like Unixutils include some tools
    (<span class="Li">&quot;type&quot;</span> for instance) which override the
    Windows ones and makes tests fail. Remove them from your path while testing
    to avoid these errors.</p>
<p class="Pp">Please report any other failures as described under &quot;BUGS AND
    CAVEATS&quot;.</p>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>Environment Variables</dt>
  <dd>The installation paths that you set during the build get compiled into
      perl, so you don't have to do anything additional to start using that perl
      (except add its location to your PATH variable).
    <p class="Pp">If you put extensions in unusual places, you can set PERL5LIB
        to a list of paths separated by semicolons where you want perl to look
        for libraries. Look for descriptions of other environment variables you
        can set in perlrun.</p>
    <p class="Pp">You can also control the shell that perl uses to run
        <b>system()</b> and backtick commands via PERL5SHELL. See perlrun.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Perl does not depend on the registry, but it can look up
        certain default values if you choose to put them there unless disabled
        at build time with USE_NO_REGISTRY. On Perl process start Perl checks if
        <span class="Li">&quot;HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Perl&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Perl&quot;</span>
        exist. If the keys exists, they will be checked for remainder of the
        Perl process's run life for certain entries. Entries in
        <span class="Li">&quot;HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Perl&quot;</span>
        override entries in
        <span class="Li">&quot;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Perl&quot;</span>.
        One or more of the following entries (of type REG_SZ or REG_EXPAND_SZ)
        may be set in the keys:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
 lib-$]        version-specific standard library path to add to @INC
 lib           standard library path to add to @INC
 sitelib-$]    version-specific site library path to add to @INC
 sitelib       site library path to add to @INC
 vendorlib-$]  version-specific vendor library path to add to @INC
 vendorlib     vendor library path to add to @INC
 PERL*         fallback for all %ENV lookups that begin with &quot;PERL&quot;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Note the <span class="Li">$]</span> in the above is not
        literal. Substitute whatever version of perl you want to honor that
        entry, e.g. <span class="Li">5.6.0</span>. Paths must be separated with
        semicolons, as usual on Windows.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>File Globbing</dt>
  <dd>By default, perl handles file globbing using the File::Glob extension,
      which provides portable globbing.
    <p class="Pp">If you want perl to use globbing that emulates the quirks of
        DOS filename conventions, you might want to consider using File::DosGlob
        to override the internal <b>glob()</b> implementation. See File::DosGlob
        for details.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Using perl from the command line</dt>
  <dd>If you are accustomed to using perl from various command-line shells found
      in UNIX environments, you will be less than pleased with what Windows
      offers by way of a command shell.
    <p class="Pp">The crucial thing to understand about the Windows environment
        is that the command line you type in is processed twice before Perl sees
        it. First, your command shell (usually CMD.EXE) preprocesses the command
        line, to handle redirection, environment variable expansion, and
        location of the executable to run. Then, the perl executable splits the
        remaining command line into individual arguments, using the C runtime
        library upon which Perl was built.</p>
    <p class="Pp">It is particularly important to note that neither the shell
        nor the C runtime do any wildcard expansions of command-line arguments
        (so wildcards need not be quoted). Also, the quoting behaviours of the
        shell and the C runtime are rudimentary at best (and may, if you are
        using a non-standard shell, be inconsistent). The only (useful) quote
        character is the double quote (&quot;). It can be used to protect spaces
        and other special characters in arguments.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The Windows documentation describes the shell parsing rules
        here:
        &lt;http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/cmd.mspx?mfr=true&gt;
        and the C runtime parsing rules here:
        &lt;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/17w5ykft%28v=VS.100%29.aspx&gt;.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Here are some further observations based on experiments: The C
        runtime breaks arguments at spaces and passes them to programs in
        argc/argv. Double quotes can be used to prevent arguments with spaces in
        them from being split up. You can put a double quote in an argument by
        escaping it with a backslash and enclosing the whole argument within
        double quotes. The backslash and the pair of double quotes surrounding
        the argument will be stripped by the C runtime.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The file redirection characters &quot;&lt;&quot;,
        &quot;&gt;&quot;, and &quot;|&quot; can be quoted by double quotes
        (although there are suggestions that this may not always be true).
        Single quotes are not treated as quotes by the shell or the C runtime,
        they don't get stripped by the shell (just to make this type of quoting
        completely useless). The caret &quot;^&quot; has also been observed to
        behave as a quoting character, but this appears to be a shell feature,
        and the caret is not stripped from the command line, so Perl still sees
        it (and the C runtime phase does not treat the caret as a quote
        character).</p>
    <p class="Pp">Here are some examples of usage of the &quot;cmd&quot;
      shell:</p>
    <p class="Pp">This prints two doublequotes:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    perl -e &quot;print '\&quot;\&quot;' &quot;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This does the same:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    perl -e &quot;print \&quot;\\\&quot;\\\&quot;\&quot; &quot;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This prints &quot;bar&quot; and writes &quot;foo&quot; to the
        file &quot;blurch&quot;:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    perl -e &quot;print 'foo'; print STDERR 'bar'&quot; &gt; blurch
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This prints &quot;foo&quot; (&quot;bar&quot; disappears into
        nowhereland):</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    perl -e &quot;print 'foo'; print STDERR 'bar'&quot; 2&gt; nul
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This prints &quot;bar&quot; and writes &quot;foo&quot; into
        the file &quot;blurch&quot;:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    perl -e &quot;print 'foo'; print STDERR 'bar'&quot; 1&gt; blurch
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This pipes &quot;foo&quot; to the &quot;less&quot; pager and
        prints &quot;bar&quot; on the console:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    perl -e &quot;print 'foo'; print STDERR 'bar'&quot; | less
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This pipes &quot;foo\nbar\n&quot; to the less pager:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    perl -le &quot;print 'foo'; print STDERR 'bar'&quot; 2&gt;&amp;1 | less
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This pipes &quot;foo&quot; to the pager and writes
        &quot;bar&quot; in the file &quot;blurch&quot;:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    perl -e &quot;print 'foo'; print STDERR 'bar'&quot; 2&gt; blurch | less
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Discovering the usefulness of the &quot;command.com&quot;
        shell on Windows 9x is left as an exercise to the reader :)</p>
    <p class="Pp">One particularly pernicious problem with the 4NT command shell
        for Windows is that it (nearly) always treats a % character as
        indicating that environment variable expansion is needed. Under this
        shell, it is therefore important to always double any % characters which
        you want Perl to see (for example, for hash variables), even when they
        are quoted.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Building Extensions</dt>
  <dd>The Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (CPAN) offers a wealth of
      extensions, some of which require a C compiler to build. Look in
      &lt;http://www.cpan.org/&gt; for more information on CPAN.
    <p class="Pp">Note that not all of the extensions available from CPAN may
        work in the Windows environment; you should check the information at
        &lt;http://www.cpantesters.org/&gt; before investing too much effort
        into porting modules that don't readily build.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Most extensions (whether they require a C compiler or not) can
        be built, tested and installed with the standard mantra:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    perl Makefile.PL
    $MAKE
    $MAKE test
    $MAKE install
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">where <span class="Li">$MAKE</span> is whatever 'make' program
        you have configured perl to use. Use &quot;perl -V:make&quot; to find
        out what this is. Some extensions may not provide a testsuite (so
        &quot;$MAKE test&quot; may not do anything or fail), but most serious
        ones do.</p>
    <p class="Pp">It is important that you use a supported 'make' program, and
        ensure Config.pm knows about it. If you don't have nmake, you can either
        get dmake from the location mentioned earlier or get an old version of
        nmake reportedly available from:</p>
    <p class="Pp">&lt;http://download.microsoft.com/download/vc15/Patch/1.52/W95/EN-US/nmake15.exe&gt;</p>
    <p class="Pp">Another option is to use the make written in Perl, available
        from CPAN.</p>
    <p class="Pp">&lt;http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/Make/&gt;</p>
    <p class="Pp">You may also use dmake. See &quot;Make&quot; above on how to
        get it.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that MakeMaker actually emits makefiles with different
        syntax depending on what 'make' it thinks you are using. Therefore, it
        is important that one of the following values appears in Config.pm:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    make='nmake'        # MakeMaker emits nmake syntax
    make='dmake'        # MakeMaker emits dmake syntax
    any other value     # MakeMaker emits generic make syntax
                            (e.g GNU make, or Perl make)
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If the value doesn't match the 'make' program you want to use,
        edit Config.pm to fix it.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If a module implements XSUBs, you will need one of the
        supported C compilers. You must make sure you have set up the
        environment for the compiler for command-line compilation before running
        <span class="Li">&quot;perl Makefile.PL&quot;</span> or any invocation
        of make.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If a module does not build for some reason, look carefully for
        why it failed, and report problems to the module author. If it looks
        like the extension building support is at fault, report that with full
        details of how the build failed using the perlbug utility.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Command-line Wildcard Expansion</dt>
  <dd>The default command shells on DOS descendant operating systems (such as
      they are) usually do not expand wildcard arguments supplied to programs.
      They consider it the application's job to handle that. This is commonly
      achieved by linking the application (in our case, perl) with startup code
      that the C runtime libraries usually provide. However, doing that results
      in incompatible perl versions (since the behavior of the argv expansion
      code differs depending on the compiler, and it is even buggy on some
      compilers). Besides, it may be a source of frustration if you use such a
      perl binary with an alternate shell that *does* expand wildcards.
    <p class="Pp">Instead, the following solution works rather well. The nice
        things about it are 1) you can start using it right away; 2) it is more
        powerful, because it will do the right thing with a pattern like
        */*/*.c; 3) you can decide whether you do/don't want to use it; and 4)
        you can extend the method to add any customizations (or even entirely
        different kinds of wildcard expansion).</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
 C:\&gt; copy con c:\perl\lib\Wild.pm
 # Wild.pm - emulate shell @ARGV expansion on shells that don't
 use File::DosGlob;
 @ARGV = map {
              my @g = File::DosGlob::glob($_) if /[*?]/;
              @g ? @g : $_;
            } @ARGV;
 1;
 ^Z
 C:\&gt; set PERL5OPT=-MWild
 C:\&gt; perl -le &quot;for (@ARGV) { print }&quot; */*/perl*.c
 p4view/perl/perl.c

 perl5.005/win32/perlglob.c
 perl5.005/win32/perllib.c
 perl5.005/win32/perlglob.c
 perl5.005/win32/perllib.c
 perl5.005/win32/perlglob.c
 perl5.005/win32/perllib.c
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Note there are two distinct steps there: 1) You'll have to
        create Wild.pm and put it in your perl lib directory. 2) You'll need to
        set the PERL5OPT environment variable. If you want argv expansion to be
        the default, just set PERL5OPT in your default startup environment.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you are using the Visual C compiler, you can get the C
        runtime's command line wildcard expansion built into perl binary. The
        resulting binary will always expand unquoted command lines, which may
        not be what you want if you use a shell that does that for you. The
        expansion done is also somewhat less powerful than the approach
        suggested above.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Notes on 64-bit Windows</dt>
  <dd>Windows .NET Server supports the LLP64 data model on the Intel Itanium
      architecture.
    <p class="Pp">The LLP64 data model is different from the LP64 data model
        that is the norm on 64-bit Unix platforms. In the former,
        <span class="Li">&quot;int&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;long&quot;</span> are both 32-bit data types,
        while pointers are 64 bits wide. In addition, there is a separate 64-bit
        wide integral type, <span class="Li">&quot;__int64&quot;</span>. In
        contrast, the LP64 data model that is pervasive on Unix platforms
        provides <span class="Li">&quot;int&quot;</span> as the 32-bit type,
        while both the <span class="Li">&quot;long&quot;</span> type and
        pointers are of 64-bit precision. Note that both models provide for
        64-bits of addressability.</p>
    <p class="Pp">64-bit Windows running on Itanium is capable of running 32-bit
        x86 binaries transparently. This means that you could use a 32-bit build
        of Perl on a 64-bit system. Given this, why would one want to build a
        64-bit build of Perl? Here are some reasons why you would bother:</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Running_Perl_Scripts"><a class="permalink" href="#Running_Perl_Scripts">Running
  Perl Scripts</a></h2>
Perl scripts on UNIX use the &quot;#!&quot; (a.k.a &quot;shebang&quot;) line to
  indicate to the OS that it should execute the file using perl. Windows has no
  comparable means to indicate arbitrary files are executables.
<p class="Pp">Instead, all available methods to execute plain text files on
    Windows rely on the file &quot;extension&quot;. There are three methods to
    use this to execute perl scripts:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>1.</dt>
  <dd>There is a facility called &quot;file extension associations&quot;. This
      can be manipulated via the two commands &quot;assoc&quot; and
      &quot;ftype&quot; that come standard with Windows. Type &quot;ftype
      /?&quot; for a complete example of how to set this up for perl scripts
      (Say what? You thought Windows wasn't perl-ready? :).</dd>
  <dt>2.</dt>
  <dd>Since file associations don't work everywhere, and there are reportedly
      bugs with file associations where it does work, the old method of wrapping
      the perl script to make it look like a regular batch file to the OS, may
      be used. The install process makes available the &quot;pl2bat.bat&quot;
      script which can be used to wrap perl scripts into batch files. For
      example:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
        pl2bat foo.pl
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">will create the file &quot;FOO.BAT&quot;. Note
        &quot;pl2bat&quot; strips any .pl suffix and adds a .bat suffix to the
        generated file.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you use the 4DOS/NT or similar command shell, note that
        &quot;pl2bat&quot; uses the &quot;%*&quot; variable in the generated
        batch file to refer to all the command line arguments, so you may need
        to make sure that construct works in batch files. As of this writing,
        4DOS/NT users will need a &quot;ParameterChar = *&quot; statement in
        their 4NT.INI file or will need to execute &quot;setdos /p*&quot; in the
        4DOS/NT startup file to enable this to work.</p>

  <dd>Using &quot;pl2bat&quot; has a few problems: the file name gets changed,
      so scripts that rely on <span class="Li">$0</span> to find what they must
      do may not run properly; running &quot;pl2bat&quot; replicates the
      contents of the original script, and so this process can be maintenance
      intensive if the originals get updated often. A different approach that
      avoids both problems is possible.
    <p class="Pp">A script called &quot;runperl.bat&quot; is available that can
        be copied to any filename (along with the .bat suffix). For example, if
        you call it &quot;foo.bat&quot;, it will run the file &quot;foo&quot;
        when it is executed. Since you can run batch files on Windows platforms
        simply by typing the name (without the extension), this effectively runs
        the file &quot;foo&quot;, when you type either &quot;foo&quot; or
        &quot;foo.bat&quot;. With this method, &quot;foo.bat&quot; can even be
        in a different location than the file &quot;foo&quot;, as long as
        &quot;foo&quot; is available somewhere on the PATH. If your scripts are
        on a filesystem that allows symbolic links, you can even avoid copying
        &quot;runperl.bat&quot;.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Here's a diversion: copy &quot;runperl.bat&quot; to
        &quot;runperl&quot;, and type &quot;runperl&quot;. Explain the observed
        behavior, or lack thereof. :) Hint: .gnidnats llits er'uoy fi

A full set of HTML documentation is installed, so you should be able to use it
  if you have a web browser installed on your system.
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;perldoc&quot;</span> is also a useful tool
    for browsing information contained in the documentation, especially in
    conjunction with a pager like <span class="Li">&quot;less&quot;</span>
    (recent versions of which have Windows support). You may have to set the
    PAGER environment variable to use a specific pager. &quot;perldoc -f
    foo&quot; will print information about the perl operator
  &quot;foo&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">One common mistake when using this port with a GUI library like
    <span class="Li">&quot;Tk&quot;</span> is assuming that Perl's normal
    behavior of opening a command-line window will go away. This isn't the case.
    If you want to start a copy of <span class="Li">&quot;perl&quot;</span>
    without opening a command-line window, use the
    <span class="Li">&quot;wperl&quot;</span> executable built during the
    installation process. Usage is exactly the same as normal
    <span class="Li">&quot;perl&quot;</span> on Windows, except that options
    like <span class="Li">&quot;-h&quot;</span> don't work (since they need a
    command-line window to print to).</p>
<p class="Pp">If you find bugs in perl, you can run
    <span class="Li">&quot;perlbug&quot;</span> to create a bug report (you may
    have to send it manually if <span class="Li">&quot;perlbug&quot;</span>
    cannot find a mailer on your system).</p>

Norton AntiVirus interferes with the build process, particularly if set to
  &quot;AutoProtect, All Files, when Opened&quot;. Unlike large applications the
  perl build process opens and modifies a lot of files. Having the the AntiVirus
  scan each and every one slows build the process significantly. Worse, with
  PERLIO=stdio the build process fails with peculiar messages as the virus
  checker interacts badly with miniperl.exe writing configure files (it seems to
  either catch file part written and treat it as suspicious, or virus checker
  may have it &quot;locked&quot; in a way which inhibits miniperl updating it).
  The build does complete with
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
   set PERLIO=perlio
</pre>
<p class="Pp">but that may be just luck. Other AntiVirus software may have
    similar issues.</p>
<p class="Pp">A git GUI shell extension for Windows such as TortoiseGit will
    cause the build and later <span class="Li">&quot;make test&quot;</span> to
    run much slower since every file is checked for its git status as soon as it
    is created and/or modified. TortoiseGit doesn't cause any test failures or
    build problems unlike the antivirus software described above, but it does
    cause similar slowness. It is suggested to use Task Manager to look for
    background processes which use high CPU amounts during the building
  process.</p>
<p class="Pp">Some of the built-in functions do not act exactly as documented in
    perlfunc, and a few are not implemented at all. To avoid surprises,
    particularly if you have had prior exposure to Perl in other operating
    environments or if you intend to write code that will be portable to other
    environments, see perlport for a reasonably definitive list of these
    differences.</p>
<p class="Pp">Not all extensions available from CPAN may build or work properly
    in the Windows environment. See &quot;Building Extensions&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">Most <span class="Li">&quot;socket()&quot;</span> related calls
    are supported, but they may not behave as on Unix platforms. See perlport
    for the full list.</p>
<p class="Pp">Signal handling may not behave as on Unix platforms (where it
    doesn't exactly &quot;behave&quot;, either :). For instance, calling
    <span class="Li">&quot;die()&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;exit()&quot;</span> from signal handlers will cause
    an exception, since most implementations of
    <span class="Li">&quot;signal()&quot;</span> on Windows are severely
    crippled. Thus, signals may work only for simple things like setting a flag
    variable in the handler. Using signals under this port should currently be
    considered unsupported.</p>
<p class="Pp">Please send detailed descriptions of any problems and solutions
    that you may find to &lt;<i>perlbug@perl.org</i>&gt;, along with the output
    produced by <span class="Li">&quot;perl -V&quot;</span>.</p>

This port was originally contributed by Gary Ng around 5.003_24, and borrowed
  from the Hip Communications port that was available at the time. Various
  people have made numerous and sundry hacks since then.
<p class="Pp">GCC/mingw32 support was added in 5.005 (Nick Ing-Simmons).</p>
<p class="Pp">Support for PERL_OBJECT was added in 5.005 (ActiveState Tool
    Corp).</p>
<p class="Pp">Support for <b>fork()</b> emulation was added in 5.6 (ActiveState
    Tool Corp).</p>
<p class="Pp">Win9x support was added in 5.6 (Benjamin Stuhl).</p>
<p class="Pp">Support for 64-bit Windows added in 5.8 (ActiveState Corp).</p>
