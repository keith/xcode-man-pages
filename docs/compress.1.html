The <code class="Nm">compress</code> utility reduces the size of files using
  adaptive Lempel-Ziv coding. Each <var class="Ar">file</var> is renamed to the
  same name plus the extension <span class="Pa">.Z</span>. A
  <var class="Ar">file</var> argument with a <span class="Pa">.Z</span>
  extension will be ignored except it will cause an error exit after other
  arguments are processed. If compression would not reduce the size of a
  <var class="Ar">file</var>, the file is ignored.
<p class="Pp">The <code class="Nm">uncompress</code> utility restores compressed
    files to their original form, renaming the files by deleting the
    <span class="Pa">.Z</span> extensions. A file specification need not include
    the file's <span class="Pa">.Z</span> extension. If a file's name in its
    file system does not have a <span class="Pa">.Z</span> extension, it will
    not be uncompressed and it will cause an error exit after other arguments
    are processed.</p>
<p class="Pp">If renaming the files would cause files to be overwritten and the
    standard input device is a terminal, the user is prompted (on the standard
    error output) for confirmation. If prompting is not possible or confirmation
    is not received, the files are not overwritten.</p>
<p class="Pp">As many of the modification time, access time, file flags, file
    mode, user ID, and group ID as allowed by permissions are retained in the
    new file.</p>
<p class="Pp">If no files are specified or a <var class="Ar">file</var> argument
    is a single dash (&#x2018;<code class="Fl">-</code>&#x2019;), the standard
    input is compressed or uncompressed to the standard output. If either the
    input and output files are not regular files, the checks for reduction in
    size and file overwriting are not performed, the input file is not removed,
    and the attributes of the input file are not retained in the output
  file.</p>
<p class="Pp">The options are as follows:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><a class="permalink" href="#b"><code class="Fl" id="b">-b</code></a>
    <var class="Ar">bits</var></dt>
  <dd>The code size (see below) is limited to <var class="Ar">bits</var>, which
      must be in the range 9..16. The default is 16.</dd>
  <dt><a class="permalink" href="#c"><code class="Fl" id="c">-c</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Compressed or uncompressed output is written to the standard output. No
      files are modified. The <code class="Fl">-v</code> option is ignored.
      Compression is attempted even if the results will be larger than the
      original.</dd>
  <dt><a class="permalink" href="#f"><code class="Fl" id="f">-f</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Files are overwritten without prompting for confirmation. Also, for
      <code class="Nm">compress</code>, files are compressed even if they are
      not actually reduced in size.</dd>
  <dt><a class="permalink" href="#v"><code class="Fl" id="v">-v</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Print the percentage reduction of each file. Ignored by
      <code class="Nm">uncompress</code> or if the <code class="Fl">-c</code>
      option is also used.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The <code class="Nm">compress</code> utility uses a modified
    Lempel-Ziv algorithm. Common substrings in the file are first replaced by
    9-bit codes 257 and up. When code 512 is reached, the algorithm switches to
    10-bit codes and continues to use more bits until the limit specified by the
    <code class="Fl">-b</code> option or its default is reached.</p>
<p class="Pp">After the limit is reached, <code class="Nm">compress</code>
    periodically checks the compression ratio. If it is increasing,
    <code class="Nm">compress</code> continues to use the existing code
    dictionary. However, if the compression ratio decreases,
    <code class="Nm">compress</code> discards the table of substrings and
    rebuilds it from scratch. This allows the algorithm to adapt to the next
    &quot;block&quot; of the file.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <code class="Fl">-b</code> option is unavailable for
    <code class="Nm">uncompress</code> since the <var class="Ar">bits</var>
    parameter specified during compression is encoded within the output, along
    with a magic number to ensure that neither decompression of random data nor
    recompression of compressed data is attempted.</p>
<p class="Pp">The amount of compression obtained depends on the size of the
    input, the number of <var class="Ar">bits</var> per code, and the
    distribution of common substrings. Typically, text such as source code or
    English is reduced by 50-60%. Compression is generally much better than that
    achieved by Huffman coding (as used in the historical command pack), or
    adaptive Huffman coding (as used in the historical command compact), and
    takes less time to compute.</p>

Some of these might be considered otherwise-undocumented features.
<p class="Pp"><code class="Nm">compress</code>: If the utility does not compress
    a file because doing so would not reduce its size, and a file of the same
    name except with an <span class="Pa">.Z</span> extension exists, the named
    file is not really ignored as stated above; it causes a prompt to confirm
    the overwriting of the file with the extension. If the operation is
    confirmed, that file is deleted.</p>
<p class="Pp"><code class="Nm">uncompress</code>: If an empty file is compressed
    (using <code class="Fl">-f</code>), the resulting <span class="Pa">.Z</span>
    file is also empty. That seems right, but if
    <code class="Nm">uncompress</code> is then used on that file, an error will
    occur.</p>
<p class="Pp">Both utilities: If a &#x2018;<code class="Fl">-</code>&#x2019;
    argument is used and the utility prompts the user, the standard input is
    taken as the user's reply to the prompt.</p>
<p class="Pp">Both utilities: If the specified file does not exist, but a
    similarly-named one with (for <code class="Nm">compress</code>) or without
    (for <code class="Nm">uncompress</code>) a <span class="Pa">.Z</span>
    extension does exist, the utility will waste the user's time by not
    immediately emitting an error message about the missing file and continuing.
    Instead, it first asks for confirmation to overwrite the existing file and
    then does not overwrite it.</p>
