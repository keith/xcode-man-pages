The <span class="Li">&quot;NEXT&quot;</span> module adds a pseudoclass named
  <span class="Li">&quot;NEXT&quot;</span> to any program that uses it. If a
  method <span class="Li">&quot;m&quot;</span> calls
  <span class="Li">&quot;$self-&gt;NEXT::m()&quot;</span>, the call to
  <span class="Li">&quot;m&quot;</span> is redispatched as if the calling method
  had not originally been found.
<p class="Pp"><b>Note:</b> before using this module, you should look at
    next::method &lt;https://metacpan.org/pod/mro#next::method&gt; in the core
    mro module. <span class="Li">&quot;mro&quot;</span> has been a core module
    since Perl 5.9.5.</p>
<p class="Pp">In other words, a call to
    <span class="Li">&quot;$self-&gt;NEXT::m()&quot;</span> resumes the
    depth-first, left-to-right search of <span class="Li">$self</span>'s class
    hierarchy that resulted in the original call to
    <span class="Li">&quot;m&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that this is not the same thing as
    <span class="Li">&quot;$self-&gt;SUPER::m()&quot;</span>, which begins a new
    dispatch that is restricted to searching the ancestors of the current class.
    <span class="Li">&quot;$self-&gt;NEXT::m()&quot;</span> can backtrack past
    the current class -- to look for a suitable method in other ancestors of
    <span class="Li">$self</span> -- whereas
    <span class="Li">&quot;$self-&gt;SUPER::m()&quot;</span> cannot.</p>
<p class="Pp">A typical use would be in the destructors of a class hierarchy, as
    illustrated in the SYNOPSIS above. Each class in the hierarchy has a DESTROY
    method that performs some class-specific action and then redispatches the
    call up the hierarchy. As a result, when an object of class S is destroyed,
    the destructors of <i>all</i> its parent classes are called (in depth-first,
    left-to-right order).</p>
<p class="Pp">Another typical use of redispatch would be in
    <span class="Li">&quot;AUTOLOAD&quot;</span>'ed methods. If such a method
    determined that it was not able to handle a particular call, it might choose
    to redispatch that call, in the hope that some other
    <span class="Li">&quot;AUTOLOAD&quot;</span> (above it, or to its left)
    might do better.</p>
<p class="Pp">By default, if a redispatch attempt fails to find another method
    elsewhere in the objects class hierarchy, it quietly gives up and does
    nothing (but see &quot;Enforcing redispatch&quot;). This gracious
    acquiescence is also unlike the (generally annoying) behaviour of
    <span class="Li">&quot;SUPER&quot;</span>, which throws an exception if it
    cannot redispatch.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that it is a fatal error for any method (including
    <span class="Li">&quot;AUTOLOAD&quot;</span>) to attempt to redispatch any
    method that does not have the same name. For example:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
        sub S::oops { print &quot;oops!\n&quot;; $_[0]-&gt;NEXT::other_method() }
</pre>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Enforcing_redispatch"><a class="permalink" href="#Enforcing_redispatch">Enforcing
  redispatch</a></h2>
It is possible to make <span class="Li">&quot;NEXT&quot;</span> redispatch more
  demandingly (i.e. like <span class="Li">&quot;SUPER&quot;</span> does), so
  that the redispatch throws an exception if it cannot find a &quot;next&quot;
  method to call.
<p class="Pp">To do this, simple invoke the redispatch as:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
        $self-&gt;NEXT::ACTUAL::method();
</pre>
<p class="Pp">rather than:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
        $self-&gt;NEXT::method();
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;ACTUAL&quot;</span> tells
    <span class="Li">&quot;NEXT&quot;</span> that there must actually be a next
    method to call, or it should throw an exception.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;NEXT::ACTUAL&quot;</span> is most commonly
    used in <span class="Li">&quot;AUTOLOAD&quot;</span> methods, as a means to
    decline an <span class="Li">&quot;AUTOLOAD&quot;</span> request, but
    preserve the normal exception-on-failure semantics:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
        sub AUTOLOAD {
                if ($AUTOLOAD =~ /foo|bar/) {
                        # handle here
                }
                else {  # try elsewhere
                        shift()-&gt;NEXT::ACTUAL::AUTOLOAD(@_);
                }
        }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">By using <span class="Li">&quot;NEXT::ACTUAL&quot;</span>, if
    there is no other <span class="Li">&quot;AUTOLOAD&quot;</span> to handle the
    method call, an exception will be thrown (as usually happens in the absence
    of a suitable <span class="Li">&quot;AUTOLOAD&quot;</span>).</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Avoiding_repetitions"><a class="permalink" href="#Avoiding_repetitions">Avoiding
  repetitions</a></h2>
If <span class="Li">&quot;NEXT&quot;</span> redispatching is used in the methods
  of a &quot;diamond&quot; class hierarchy:
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
        #     A   B
        #    / \ /
        #   C   D
        #    \ /
        #     E

        use NEXT;

        package A;                 
        sub foo { print &quot;called A::foo\n&quot;; shift-&gt;NEXT::foo() }

        package B;                 
        sub foo { print &quot;called B::foo\n&quot;; shift-&gt;NEXT::foo() }

        package C; @ISA = qw( A );
        sub foo { print &quot;called C::foo\n&quot;; shift-&gt;NEXT::foo() }

        package D; @ISA = qw(A B);
        sub foo { print &quot;called D::foo\n&quot;; shift-&gt;NEXT::foo() }

        package E; @ISA = qw(C D);
        sub foo { print &quot;called E::foo\n&quot;; shift-&gt;NEXT::foo() }

        E-&gt;foo();
</pre>
<p class="Pp">then derived classes may (re-)inherit base-class methods through
    two or more distinct paths (e.g. in the way
    <span class="Li">&quot;E&quot;</span> inherits
    <span class="Li">&quot;A::foo&quot;</span> twice -- through
    <span class="Li">&quot;C&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;D&quot;</span>). In such cases, a sequence of
    <span class="Li">&quot;NEXT&quot;</span> redispatches will invoke the
    multiply inherited method as many times as it is inherited. For example, the
    above code prints:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
        called E::foo
        called C::foo
        called A::foo
        called D::foo
        called A::foo
        called B::foo
</pre>
<p class="Pp">(i.e. <span class="Li">&quot;A::foo&quot;</span> is called
  twice).</p>
<p class="Pp">In some cases this <i>may</i> be the desired effect within a
    diamond hierarchy, but in others (e.g. for destructors) it may be more
    appropriate to call each method only once during a sequence of
  redispatches.</p>
<p class="Pp">To cover such cases, you can redispatch methods via:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
        $self-&gt;NEXT::DISTINCT::method();
</pre>
<p class="Pp">rather than:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
        $self-&gt;NEXT::method();
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This causes the redispatcher to only visit each distinct
    <span class="Li">&quot;method&quot;</span> method once. That is, to skip any
    classes in the hierarchy that it has already visited during redispatch. So,
    for example, if the previous example were rewritten:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
        package A;                 
        sub foo { print &quot;called A::foo\n&quot;; shift-&gt;NEXT::DISTINCT::foo() }

        package B;                 
        sub foo { print &quot;called B::foo\n&quot;; shift-&gt;NEXT::DISTINCT::foo() }

        package C; @ISA = qw( A );
        sub foo { print &quot;called C::foo\n&quot;; shift-&gt;NEXT::DISTINCT::foo() }

        package D; @ISA = qw(A B);
        sub foo { print &quot;called D::foo\n&quot;; shift-&gt;NEXT::DISTINCT::foo() }

        package E; @ISA = qw(C D);
        sub foo { print &quot;called E::foo\n&quot;; shift-&gt;NEXT::DISTINCT::foo() }

        E-&gt;foo();
</pre>
<p class="Pp">then it would print:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
        called E::foo
        called C::foo
        called A::foo
        called D::foo
        called B::foo
</pre>
<p class="Pp">and omit the second call to
    <span class="Li">&quot;A::foo&quot;</span> (since it would not be distinct
    from the first call to <span class="Li">&quot;A::foo&quot;</span>).</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that you can also use:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
        $self-&gt;NEXT::DISTINCT::ACTUAL::method();
</pre>
<p class="Pp">or:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
        $self-&gt;NEXT::ACTUAL::DISTINCT::method();
</pre>
<p class="Pp">to get both unique invocation <i>and</i> exception-on-failure.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that, for historical compatibility, you can also use
    <span class="Li">&quot;NEXT::UNSEEN&quot;</span> instead of
    <span class="Li">&quot;NEXT::DISTINCT&quot;</span>.</p>

  all versions of a method with a single call</a></h2>
Yet another pseudo-class that <span class="Li">&quot;NEXT&quot;</span> provides
  is <span class="Li">&quot;EVERY&quot;</span>. Its behaviour is considerably
  simpler than that of the <span class="Li">&quot;NEXT&quot;</span> family. A
  call to:
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
        $obj-&gt;EVERY::foo();
</pre>
<p class="Pp">calls <i>every</i> method named
    <span class="Li">&quot;foo&quot;</span> that the object in
    <span class="Li">$obj</span> has inherited. That is:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
        use NEXT;

        package A; @ISA = qw(B D X);
        sub foo { print &quot;A::foo &quot; }

        package B; @ISA = qw(D X);
        sub foo { print &quot;B::foo &quot; }

        package X; @ISA = qw(D);
        sub foo { print &quot;X::foo &quot; }

        package D;
        sub foo { print &quot;D::foo &quot; }

        package main;

        my $obj = bless {}, 'A';
        $obj-&gt;EVERY::foo();        # prints&quot; A::foo B::foo X::foo D::foo
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Prefixing a method call with
    <span class="Li">&quot;EVERY::&quot;</span> causes every method in the
    object's hierarchy with that name to be invoked. As the above example
    illustrates, they are not called in Perl's usual
    &quot;left-most-depth-first&quot; order. Instead, they are called
    &quot;breadth-first-dependency-wise&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">That means that the inheritance tree of the object is traversed
    breadth-first and the resulting order of classes is used as the sequence in
    which methods are called. However, that sequence is modified by imposing a
    rule that the appropriate method of a derived class must be called before
    the same method of any ancestral class. That's why, in the above example,
    <span class="Li">&quot;X::foo&quot;</span> is called before
    <span class="Li">&quot;D::foo&quot;</span>, even though
    <span class="Li">&quot;D&quot;</span> comes before
    <span class="Li">&quot;X&quot;</span> in
  <span class="Li">@B::ISA</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">In general, there's no need to worry about the order of calls.
    They will be left-to-right, breadth-first, most-derived-first. This works
    perfectly for most inherited methods (including destructors), but is
    inappropriate for some kinds of methods (such as constructors, cloners,
    debuggers, and initializers) where it's more appropriate that the
    least-derived methods be called first (as more-derived methods may rely on
    the behaviour of their &quot;ancestors&quot;). In that case, instead of
    using the <span class="Li">&quot;EVERY&quot;</span> pseudo-class:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
        $obj-&gt;EVERY::foo();        # prints&quot; A::foo B::foo X::foo D::foo
</pre>
<p class="Pp">you can use the <span class="Li">&quot;EVERY::LAST&quot;</span>
    pseudo-class:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
        $obj-&gt;EVERY::LAST::foo();  # prints&quot; D::foo X::foo B::foo A::foo
</pre>
<p class="Pp">which reverses the order of method call.</p>
<p class="Pp">Whichever version is used, the actual methods are called in the
    same context (list, scalar, or void) as the original call via
    <span class="Li">&quot;EVERY&quot;</span>, and return:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>A hash of array references in list context. Each entry of the hash has the
      fully qualified method name as its key and a reference to an array
      containing the method's list-context return values as its value.</li>
  <li>A reference to a hash of scalar values in scalar context. Each entry of
      the hash has the fully qualified method name as its key and the method's
      scalar-context return values as its value.</li>
  <li>Nothing in void context (obviously).</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Using__EVERY__methods"><a class="permalink" href="#Using__EVERY__methods">Using
  &quot;EVERY&quot; methods</a></h2>
The typical way to use an <span class="Li">&quot;EVERY&quot;</span> call is to
  wrap it in another base method, that all classes inherit. For example, to
  ensure that every destructor an object inherits is actually called (as opposed
  to just the left-most-depth-first-est one):
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
        package Base;
        sub DESTROY { $_[0]-&gt;EVERY::Destroy }

        package Derived1; 
        use base 'Base';
        sub Destroy {...}

        package Derived2; 
        use base 'Base', 'Derived1';
        sub Destroy {...}
</pre>
<p class="Pp">et cetera. Every derived class than needs its own clean-up
    behaviour simply adds its own <span class="Li">&quot;Destroy&quot;</span>
    method (<i>not</i> a <span class="Li">&quot;DESTROY&quot;</span> method),
    which the call to <span class="Li">&quot;EVERY::LAST::Destroy&quot;</span>
    in the inherited destructor then correctly picks up.</p>
<p class="Pp">Likewise, to create a class hierarchy in which every initializer
    inherited by a new object is invoked:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
        package Base;
        sub new {
                my ($class, %args) = @_;
                my $obj = bless {}, $class;
                $obj-&gt;EVERY::LAST::Init(\%args);
        }

        package Derived1; 
        use base 'Base';
        sub Init {
                my ($argsref) = @_;
                ...
        }

        package Derived2; 
        use base 'Base', 'Derived1';
        sub Init {
                my ($argsref) = @_;
                ...
        }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">et cetera. Every derived class than needs some additional
    initialization behaviour simply adds its own
    <span class="Li">&quot;Init&quot;</span> method (<i>not</i> a
    <span class="Li">&quot;new&quot;</span> method), which the call to
    <span class="Li">&quot;EVERY::LAST::Init&quot;</span> in the inherited
