XML::LibXML::DOM - XML::LibXML DOM Implementation
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
XML::LibXML provides an light-wight interface to <i>modify</i> a node of the
  document tree generated by the XML::LibXML parser. This interface follows as
  far as possible the DOM Level 3 specification. Additionally to the specified
  functions the XML::LibXML supports some functions that are more handy to use
  in the perl environment.
<p class="Pp">One also has to remember, that XML::LibXML is an interface to
    libxml2 nodes which actually reside on the C-Level of XML::LibXML. This
    means each node is a reference to a structure different than a perl hash or
    array. The only way to access these structure's values is through the DOM
    interface provided by XML::LibXML. This also means, that one <i>can't</i>
    simply inherit an XML::LibXML node and add new member variables as they were
    hash keys.</p>
<p class="Pp">The DOM interface of XML::LibXML does not intend to implement a
    full DOM interface as it is done by XML::GDOME and used for full featured
    application. Moreover, it offers an simple way to build or modify documents
    that are created by XML::LibXML's parser.</p>
<p class="Pp">Another target of the XML::LibXML interface is to make the
    interfaces of libxml2 available to the perl community. This includes also
    some workarounds to some features where libxml2 assumes more control over
    the C-Level that most perl users don't have.</p>
<p class="Pp">One of the most important parts of the XML::LibXML DOM interface
    is, that the interfaces try do follow the DOM Level 3 specification
    (&lt;http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Core/&gt;) rather strictly. This means
    the interface functions are named as the DOM specification says and not what
    widespread Java interfaces claim to be standard. Although there are several
    functions that have only a singular interface that conforms to the DOM spec
    XML::LibXML provides an additional Java style alias interface.</p>
<p class="Pp">Also there are some function interfaces left over from early
    stages of XML::LibXML for compatibility reasons. These interfaces are for
    compatibility reasons <i>only</i>. They might disappear in one of the future
    versions of XML::LibXML, so a user is requested to switch over to the
    official functions.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Namespaces_and_XML::LibXML's__s-1DOM_s0_implementation"><a class="permalink" href="#Namespaces_and_XML::LibXML's__s-1DOM_s0_implementation">Namespaces
  and XML::LibXML's DOM implementation</a></h2>
XML::LibXML's DOM implementation is limited by the DOM implementation of libxml2
  which treats namespaces slightly differently than required by the DOM Level 2
  specification.
<p class="Pp">According to the DOM Level 2 specification, namespaces of elements
    and attributes should be persistent, and nodes should be permanently bound
    to namespace URIs as they get created; it should be possible to manipulate
    the special attributes used for declaring XML namespaces just as other
    attributes without affecting the namespaces of other nodes. In DOM Level 2,
    the application is responsible for creating the special attributes
    consistently and/or for correct serialization of the document.</p>
<p class="Pp">This is both inconvenient, causes problems in serialization of DOM
    to XML, and most importantly, seems almost impossible to implement over
    libxml2.</p>
<p class="Pp">In libxml2, namespace URI and prefix of a node is provided by a
    pointer to a namespace declaration (appearing as a special xmlns attribute
    in the XML document). If the prefix or namespace URI of the declaration
    changes, the prefix and namespace URI of all nodes that point to it changes
    as well. Moreover, in contrast to DOM, a node (element or attribute) can
    only be bound to a namespace URI if there is some namespace declaration in
    the document to point to.</p>
<p class="Pp">Therefore current DOM implementation in XML::LibXML tries to treat
    namespace declarations in a compromise between reason, common sense,
    limitations of libxml2, and the DOM Level 2 specification.</p>
<p class="Pp">In XML::LibXML, special attributes declaring XML namespaces are
    often created automatically, usually when a namespaced node is attached to a
    document and no existing declaration of the namespace and prefix is in the
    scope to be reused. In this respect, XML::LibXML DOM implementation differs
    from the DOM Level 2 specification according to which special attributes for
    declaring the appropriate XML namespaces should not be added when a node
    with a namespace prefix and namespace URI is created.</p>
<p class="Pp">Namespace declarations are also created when
    XML::LibXML::Document's <i>createElementNS()</i> or
    <i>createAttributeNS()</i> function are used. If the a namespace is not
    declared on the documentElement, the namespace will be locally declared for
    the newly created node. In case of Attributes this may look a bit confusing,
    since these nodes cannot have namespace declarations itself. In this case
    the namespace is internally applied to the attribute and later declared on
    the node the attribute is appended to (if required).</p>
<p class="Pp">The following example may explain this a bit:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  my $doc = XML::LibXML-&gt;createDocument;
  my $root = $doc-&gt;createElementNS( &quot;&quot;, &quot;foo&quot; );
  $doc-&gt;setDocumentElement( $root );

  my $attr = $doc-&gt;createAttributeNS( &quot;bar&quot;, &quot;bar:foo&quot;, &quot;test&quot; );
  $root-&gt;setAttributeNodeNS( $attr );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This piece of code will result in the following document:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
  &lt;foo xmlns:bar=&quot;bar&quot; bar:foo=&quot;test&quot;/&gt;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The namespace is declared on the document element during the
    <i>setAttributeNodeNS()</i> call.</p>
<p class="Pp">Namespaces can be also declared explicitly by the use of
    XML::LibXML::Element's <i>setNamespace()</i> function. Since 1.61, they can
    also be manipulated with functions <i>setNamespaceDeclPrefix()</i> and
    <i>setNamespaceDeclURI()</i> (not available in DOM). Changing an URI or
    prefix of an existing namespace declaration affects the namespace URI and
    prefix of all nodes which point to it (that is the nodes in its scope).</p>
<p class="Pp">It is also important to repeat the specification: While working
    with namespaces you should use the namespace aware functions instead of the
    simplified versions. For example you should <i>never</i> use
    <i>setAttribute()</i> but <i>setAttributeNS()</i>.</p>
