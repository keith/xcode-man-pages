   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_TraceCommand</b> allows a C procedure to monitor operations
    performed on a Tcl command, so that the C procedure is invoked whenever the
    command is renamed or deleted. If the trace is created successfully then
    <b>Tcl_TraceCommand</b> returns <b>TCL_OK</b>. If an error occurred (e.g.
    <i>cmdName</i> specifies a non-existent command) then <b>TCL_ERROR</b> is
    returned and an error message is left in the interpreter's result.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>flags</i> argument to <b>Tcl_TraceCommand</b> indicates
    when the trace procedure is to be invoked. It consists of an OR'ed
    combination of any of the following values:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="TCL_TRACE_RENAME"><a class="permalink" href="#TCL_TRACE_RENAME"><b>TCL_TRACE_RENAME</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Invoke <i>proc</i> whenever the command is renamed.</dd>
  <dt id="TCL_TRACE_DELETE"><a class="permalink" href="#TCL_TRACE_DELETE"><b>TCL_TRACE_DELETE</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Invoke <i>proc</i> when the command is deleted.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Whenever one of the specified operations occurs to the command,
    <i>proc</i> will be invoked. It should have arguments and result that match
    the type <b>Tcl_CommandTraceProc</b>:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
typedef void Tcl_CommandTraceProc(
<br/>
        ClientData <i>clientData</i>,
<br/>
        Tcl_Interp *<i>interp</i>,
<br/>
        const char *<i>oldName</i>,
<br/>
        const char *<i>newName</i>,
<br/>
        int <i>flags</i>);</pre>
</div>
The <i>clientData</i> and <i>interp</i> parameters will have the same values as
  those passed to <b>Tcl_TraceCommand</b> when the trace was created.
  <i>ClientData</i> typically points to an application-specific data structure
  that describes what to do when <i>proc</i> is invoked. <i>OldName</i> gives
  the name of the command being renamed, and <i>newName</i> gives the name that
  the command is being renamed to (or an empty string or NULL when the command
  is being deleted.) <i>Flags</i> is an OR'ed combination of bits potentially
  providing several pieces of information. One of the bits
  <b>TCL_TRACE_RENAME</b> and <b>TCL_TRACE_DELETE</b> will be set in
  <i>flags</i> to indicate which operation is being performed on the command.
  The bit <b>TCL_TRACE_DESTROYED</b> will be set in <i>flags</i> if the trace is
  about to be destroyed; this information may be useful to <i>proc</i> so that
  it can clean up its own internal data structures (see the section
  <b>TCL_TRACE_DESTROYED</b> below for more details). Lastly, the bit
  <b>TCL_INTERP_DESTROYED</b> will be set if the entire interpreter is being
  destroyed. When this bit is set, <i>proc</i> must be especially careful in the
  things it does (see the section <b>TCL_INTERP_DESTROYED</b> below).
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_UntraceCommand</b> may be used to remove a trace. If the
    command specified by <i>interp</i>, <i>cmdName</i>, and <i>flags</i> has a
    trace set with <i>flags</i>, <i>proc</i>, and <i>clientData</i>, then the
    corresponding trace is removed. If no such trace exists, then the call to
    <b>Tcl_UntraceCommand</b> has no effect. The same bits are valid for
    <i>flags</i> as for calls to <b>Tcl_TraceCommand</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_CommandTraceInfo</b> may be used to retrieve information
    about traces set on a given command. The return value from
    <b>Tcl_CommandTraceInfo</b> is the <i>clientData</i> associated with a
    particular trace. The trace must be on the command specified by the
    <i>interp</i>, <i>cmdName</i>, and <i>flags</i> arguments (note that
    currently the flags are ignored; <i>flags</i> should be set to 0 for future
    compatibility) and its trace procedure must the same as the <i>proc</i>
    argument. If the <i>prevClientData</i> argument is NULL then the return
    value corresponds to the first (most recently created) matching trace, or
    NULL if there are no matching traces. If the <i>prevClientData</i> argument
    is not NULL, then it should be the return value from a previous call to
    <b>Tcl_CommandTraceInfo</b>. In this case, the new return value will
    correspond to the next matching trace after the one whose <i>clientData</i>
    matches <i>prevClientData</i>, or NULL if no trace matches
    <i>prevClientData</i> or if there are no more matching traces after it. This
    mechanism makes it possible to step through all of the traces for a given
    command that have the same <i>proc</i>.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="CALLING_COMMANDS_DURING_TRACES"><a class="permalink" href="#CALLING_COMMANDS_DURING_TRACES">CALLING
  COMMANDS DURING TRACES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">During rename traces, the command being renamed is visible with
    both names simultaneously, and the command still exists during delete traces
    (if <b>TCL_INTERP_DESTROYED</b> is not set). However, there is no mechanism
    for signaling that an error occurred in a trace procedure, so great care
    should be taken that errors do not get silently lost.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="MULTIPLE_TRACES"><a class="permalink" href="#MULTIPLE_TRACES">MULTIPLE
  TRACES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">It is possible for multiple traces to exist on the same command.
    When this happens, all of the trace procedures will be invoked on each
    access, in order from most-recently-created to least-recently-created.
    Attempts to delete the command during a delete trace will fail silently,
    since the command is already scheduled for deletion anyway. If the command
    being renamed is renamed by one of its rename traces, that renaming takes
    precedence over the one that triggered the trace and the collection of
    traces will not be reexecuted; if several traces rename the command, the
    last renaming takes precedence.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="TCL_TRACE_DESTROYED_FLAG"><a class="permalink" href="#TCL_TRACE_DESTROYED_FLAG">TCL_TRACE_DESTROYED
  FLAG</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">In a delete callback to <i>proc</i>, the
    <b>TCL_TRACE_DESTROYED</b> bit is set in <i>flags</i>.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="TCL_INTERP_DESTROYED"><a class="permalink" href="#TCL_INTERP_DESTROYED">TCL_INTERP_DESTROYED</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">When an interpreter is destroyed, unset traces are called for all
    of its commands. The <b>TCL_INTERP_DESTROYED</b> bit will be set in the
    <i>flags</i> argument passed to the trace procedures. Trace procedures must
    be extremely careful in what they do if the <b>TCL_INTERP_DESTROYED</b> bit
    is set. It is not safe for the procedures to invoke any Tcl procedures on
    the interpreter, since its state is partially deleted. All that trace
    procedures should do under these circumstances is to clean up and free their
    own internal data structures.</p>
