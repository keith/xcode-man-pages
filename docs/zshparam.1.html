zshparam - zsh parameters
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
A parameter has a name, a value, and a number of attributes. A name may be any
  sequence of alphanumeric characters and underscores, or the single characters
  `<b>*</b>', `<b>@</b>', `<b>#</b>', `<b>?</b>', `<b>-</b>', `<b>$</b>', or
  `<b>!</b>'. A parameter whose name begins with an alphanumeric or underscore
  is also referred to as a <i>variable</i>.
<p class="Pp">The attributes of a parameter determine the <i>type</i> of its
    value, often referred to as the parameter type or variable type, and also
    control other processing that may be applied to the value when it is
    referenced. The value type may be a <i>scalar</i> (a string, an integer, or
    a floating point number), an array (indexed numerically), or an
    <i>associative</i> array (an unordered set of name-value pairs, indexed by
    name, also referred to as a <i>hash</i>).</p>
<p class="Pp">Named scalar parameters may have the <i>exported</i>, <b>-x</b>,
    attribute, to copy them into the process environment, which is then passed
    from the shell to any new processes that it starts. Exported parameters are
    called <i>environment variables</i>. The shell also <i>imports</i>
    environment variables at startup time and automatically marks the
    corresponding parameters as exported. Some environment variables are not
    imported for reasons of security or because they would interfere with the
    correct operation of other shell features.</p>
<p class="Pp">Parameters may also be <i>special</i>, that is, they have a
    predetermined meaning to the shell. Special parameters cannot have their
    type changed or their readonly attribute turned off, and if a special
    parameter is unset, then later recreated, the special properties will be
    retained.</p>
<p class="Pp">To declare the type of a parameter, or to assign a string or
    numeric value to a scalar parameter, use the <b>typeset</b> builtin.</p>
<p class="Pp">The value of a scalar parameter may also be assigned by
  writing:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<i>name</i><b>=</b><i>value</i>
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">In scalar assignment, <i>value</i> is expanded as a single string,
    in which the elements of arrays are joined together; filename expansion is
    not performed unless the option <b>GLOB_ASSIGN</b> is set.</p>
<p class="Pp">When the integer attribute, <b>-i</b>, or a floating point
    attribute, <b>-E</b> or <b>-F</b>, is set for <i>name</i>, the <i>value</i>
    is subject to arithmetic evaluation. Furthermore, by replacing `<b>=</b>'
    with `<b>+=</b>', a parameter can be incremented or appended to. See the
    section `Array Parameters' and <i>Arithmetic Evaluation</i> (in
    <i>zshmisc</i>(1)) for additional forms of assignment.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that assignment may implicitly change the attributes of a
    parameter. For example, assigning a number to a variable in arithmetic
    evaluation may change its type to integer or float, and with
    <b>GLOB_ASSIGN</b> assigning a pattern to a variable may change its type to
    an array.</p>
<p class="Pp">To reference the value of a parameter, write `<b>$</b><i>name</i>'
    or `<b>${</b><i>name</i><b>}</b>'. See <i>Parameter Expansion</i> in
    <i>zshexpn</i>(1) for complete details. That section also explains the
    effect of the difference between scalar and array assignment on parameter
    expansion.</p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="ARRAY_PARAMETERS"><a class="permalink" href="#ARRAY_PARAMETERS">ARRAY
  PARAMETERS</a></h1>
To assign an array value, write one of:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b>set -A</b> <i>name</i> <i>value</i> ...
</pre>
</div>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<i>name</i><b>=(</b><i>value</i> ...<b>)</b>
</pre>
</div>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<i>name</i><b>=(</b><b>[</b><i>key</i><b>]=</b><i>value</i> ...<b>)</b>
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">If no parameter <i>name</i> exists, an ordinary array parameter is
    created. If the parameter <i>name</i> exists and is a scalar, it is replaced
    by a new array.</p>
<p class="Pp">In the third form, <i>key</i> is an expression that will be
    evaluated in arithmetic context (in its simplest form, an integer) that
    gives the index of the element to be assigned with <i>value</i>. In this
    form any elements not explicitly mentioned that come before the largest
    index to which a value is assigned are assigned an empty string. The indices
    may be in any order. Note that this syntax is strict: <b>[</b> and <b>]=</b>
    must not be quoted, and <i>key</i> may not consist of the unquoted string
    <b>]=</b>, but is otherwise treated as a simple string. The enhanced forms
    of subscript expression that may be used when directly subscripting a
    variable name, described in the section Array Subscripts below, are not
    available.</p>
<p class="Pp">The syntaxes with and without the explicit key may be mixed. An
    implicit <i>key</i> is deduced by incrementing the index from the previously
    assigned element. Note that it is not treated as an error if latter
    assignments in this form overwrite earlier assignments.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, assuming the option <b>KSH_ARRAYS</b> is not set, the
    following:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b>array=(one [3]=three four)</b>
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">causes the array variable <b>array</b> to contain four elements
    <b>one</b>, an empty string, <b>three</b> and <b>four</b>, in that
  order.</p>
<p class="Pp">In the forms where only <i>value</i> is specified, full command
    line expansion is performed.</p>
<p class="Pp">In the <b>[</b><i>key</i><b>]=</b><i>value</i> form, both
    <i>key</i> and <i>value</i> undergo all forms of expansion allowed for
    single word shell expansions (this does not include filename generation);
    these are as performed by the parameter expansion flag <b>(e)</b> as
    described in <i>zshexpn</i>(1). Nested parentheses may surround <i>value</i>
    and are included as part of the value, which is joined into a plain string;
    this differs from ksh which allows the values themselves to be arrays. A
    future version of zsh may support that. To cause the brackets to be
    interpreted as a character class for filename generation, and therefore to
    treat the resulting list of files as a set of values, quote the equal sign
    using any form of quoting. Example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<i>name</i><b>=(</b><b>[a-z]'='*)</b>
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">To append to an array without changing the existing values, use
    one of the following:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<i>name</i><b>+=(</b><i>value</i> ...<b>)</b>
</pre>
</div>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<i>name</i><b>+=(</b><b>[</b><i>key</i><b>]=</b><i>value</i> ...<b>)</b>
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">In the second form <i>key</i> may specify an existing index as
    well as an index off the end of the old array; any existing value is
    overwritten by <i>value</i>. Also, it is possible to use
    <b>[</b><i>key</i><b>]+=</b><i>value</i> to append to the existing value at
    that index.</p>
<p class="Pp">Within the parentheses on the right hand side of either form of
    the assignment, newlines and semicolons are treated the same as white space,
    separating individual <i>value</i>s. Any consecutive sequence of such
    characters has the same effect.</p>
<p class="Pp">Ordinary array parameters may also be explicitly declared
  with:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b>typeset -a</b> <i>name</i>
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Associative arrays <i>must</i> be declared before assignment, by
    using:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b>typeset -A</b> <i>name</i>
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">When <i>name</i> refers to an associative array, the list in an
    assignment is interpreted as alternating keys and values:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b>set -A</b> <i>name</i> <i>key</i> <i>value</i> ...
</pre>
</div>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<i>name</i><b>=(</b><i>key</i> <i>value</i> ...<b>)</b>
</pre>
</div>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<i>name</i><b>=(</b><b>[</b><i>key</i><b>]=</b><i>value</i> ...<b>)</b>
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Note that only one of the two syntaxes above may be used in any
    given assignment; the forms may not be mixed. This is unlike the case of
    numerically indexed arrays.</p>
<p class="Pp">Every <i>key</i> must have a <i>value</i> in this case. Note that
    this assigns to the entire array, deleting any elements that do not appear
    in the list. The append syntax may also be used with an associative
  array:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<i>name</i><b>+=(</b><i>key</i> <i>value</i> ...<b>)</b>
</pre>
</div>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<i>name</i><b>+=(</b><b>[</b><i>key</i><b>]=</b><i>value</i> ...<b>)</b>
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">This adds a new key/value pair if the key is not already present,
    and replaces the value for the existing key if it is. In the second form it
    is also possible to use <b>[</b><i>key</i><b>]+=</b><i>value</i> to append
    to the existing value at that key. Expansion is performed identically to the
    corresponding forms for normal arrays, as described above.</p>
<p class="Pp">To create an empty array (including associative arrays), use one
    of:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b>set -A</b> <i>name</i>
</pre>
</div>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<i>name</i><b>=()</b>
</pre>
</div>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Array_Subscripts"><a class="permalink" href="#Array_Subscripts">Array
  Subscripts</a></h2>
Individual elements of an array may be selected using a subscript. A subscript
  of the form `<b>[</b><i>exp</i><b>]</b>' selects the single element
  <i>exp</i>, where <i>exp</i> is an arithmetic expression which will be subject
  to arithmetic expansion as if it were surrounded by `<b>$((</b>...<b>))</b>'.
  The elements are numbered beginning with 1, unless the <b>KSH_ARRAYS</b>
  option is set in which case they are numbered from zero.
<p class="Pp">Subscripts may be used inside braces used to delimit a parameter
    name, thus `<b>${foo[2]}</b>' is equivalent to `<b>$foo[2]</b>'. If the
    <b>KSH_ARRAYS</b> option is set, the braced form is the only one that works,
    as bracketed expressions otherwise are not treated as subscripts.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the <b>KSH_ARRAYS</b> option is not set, then by default
    accesses to an array element with a subscript that evaluates to zero return
    an empty string, while an attempt to write such an element is treated as an
    error. For backward compatibility the <b>KSH_ZERO_SUBSCRIPT</b> option can
    be set to cause subscript values 0 and 1 to be equivalent; see the
    description of the option in <i>zshoptions</i>(1).</p>
<p class="Pp">The same subscripting syntax is used for associative arrays,
    except that no arithmetic expansion is applied to <i>exp</i>. However, the
    parsing rules for arithmetic expressions still apply, which affects the way
    that certain special characters must be protected from interpretation. See
    <i>Subscript Parsing</i> below for details.</p>
<p class="Pp">A subscript of the form `<b>[*]</b>' or `<b>[@]</b>' evaluates to
    all elements of an array; there is no difference between the two except when
    they appear within double quotes. `<b>&quot;$foo[*]&quot;</b>' evaluates to
    `<b>&quot;$foo[1] $foo[2] </b>...<b>&quot;</b>', whereas
    `<b>&quot;$foo[@]&quot;</b>' evaluates to `<b>&quot;$foo[1]&quot;
    &quot;$foo[2]&quot; </b>...'. For associative arrays, `<b>[*]</b>' or
    `<b>[@]</b>' evaluate to all the values, in no particular order. Note that
    this does not substitute the keys; see the documentation for the `<b>k</b>'
    flag under <i>Parameter Expansion Flags</i> in <i>zshexpn</i>(1) for
    complete details. When an array parameter is referenced as
    `<b>$</b><i>name</i>' (with no subscript) it evaluates to
    `<b>$</b><i>name</i><b>[*]</b>', unless the <b>KSH_ARRAYS</b> option is set
    in which case it evaluates to `<b>${</b><i>name</i><b>[0]}</b>' (for an
    associative array, this means the value of the key `<b>0</b>', which may not
    exist even if there are values for other keys).</p>
<p class="Pp">A subscript of the form
    `<b>[</b><i>exp1</i><b>,</b><i>exp2</i><b>]</b>' selects all elements in the
    range <i>exp1</i> to <i>exp2</i>, inclusive. (Associative arrays are
    unordered, and so do not support ranges.) If one of the subscripts evaluates
    to a negative number, say <b>-</b><i>n</i>, then the <i>n</i>th element from
    the end of the array is used. Thus `<b>$foo[-3]</b>' is the third element
    from the end of the array <b>foo</b>, and `<b>$foo[1,-1]</b>' is the same as
    `<b>$foo[*]</b>'.</p>
<p class="Pp">Subscripting may also be performed on non-array values, in which
    case the subscripts specify a substring to be extracted. For example, if
    <b>FOO</b> is set to `<b>foobar</b>', then `<b>echo $FOO[2,5]</b>' prints
    `<b>ooba</b>'. Note that some forms of subscripting described below perform
    pattern matching, and in that case the substring extends from the start of
    the match of the first subscript to the end of the match of the second
    subscript. For example,</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b>string=&quot;abcdefghijklm&quot;</b>
<b>print ${string[(r)d?,(r)h?]}</b>
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">prints `<b>defghi</b>'. This is an obvious generalisation of the
    rule for single-character matches. For a single subscript, only a single
    character is referenced (not the range of characters covered by the
  match).</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that in substring operations the second subscript is handled
    differently by the <b>r</b> and <b>R</b> subscript flags: the former takes
    the shortest match as the length and the latter the longest match. Hence in
    the former case a <b>*</b> at the end is redundant while in the latter case
    it matches the whole remainder of the string. This does not affect the
    result of the single subscript case as here the length of the match is
    irrelevant.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Array_Element_Assignment"><a class="permalink" href="#Array_Element_Assignment">Array
  Element Assignment</a></h2>
A subscript may be used on the left side of an assignment like so:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<i>name</i><b>[</b><i>exp</i><b>]=</b><i>value</i>
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">In this form of assignment the element or range specified by
    <i>exp</i> is replaced by the expression on the right side. An array (but
    not an associative array) may be created by assignment to a range or
    element. Arrays do not nest, so assigning a parenthesized list of values to
    an element or range changes the number of elements in the array, shifting
    the other elements to accommodate the new values. (This is not supported for
    associative arrays.)</p>
<p class="Pp">This syntax also works as an argument to the <b>typeset</b>
    command:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b>typeset</b> <b>&quot;</b><i>name</i><b>[</b><i>exp</i><b>]&quot;=</b><i>value</i>
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The <i>value</i> may <i>not</i> be a parenthesized list in this
    case; only single-element assignments may be made with <b>typeset</b>. Note
    that quotes are necessary in this case to prevent the brackets from being
    interpreted as filename generation operators. The <b>noglob</b> precommand
    modifier could be used instead.</p>
<p class="Pp">To delete an element of an ordinary array, assign `<b>()</b>' to
    that element. To delete an element of an associative array, use the
    <b>unset</b> command:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b>unset</b> <b>&quot;</b><i>name</i><b>[</b><i>exp</i><b>]&quot;</b>
</pre>
</div>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Subscript_Flags"><a class="permalink" href="#Subscript_Flags">Subscript
  Flags</a></h2>
If the opening bracket, or the comma in a range, in any subscript expression is
  directly followed by an opening parenthesis, the string up to the matching
  closing one is considered to be a list of flags, as in
  `<i>name</i><b>[(</b><i>flags</i><b>)</b><i>exp</i><b>]</b>'.
<p class="Pp">The flags <b>s</b>, <b>n</b> and <b>b</b> take an argument; the
    delimiter is shown below as `<b>:</b>', but any character, or the matching
    pairs `<b>(</b>...<b>)</b>', `<b>{</b>...<b>}</b>', `<b>[</b>...<b>]</b>',
    or `<b>&lt;</b>...<b>&gt;</b>', may be used, but note that
    `<b>&lt;</b>...<b>&gt;</b>' can only be used if the subscript is inside a
    double quoted expression or a parameter substitution enclosed in braces as
    otherwise the expression is interpreted as a redirection.</p>
<p class="Pp">The flags currently understood are:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>w</b></dt>
  <dd>If the parameter subscripted is a scalar then this flag makes subscripting
      work on words instead of characters. The default word separator is
      whitespace. When combined with the <b>i</b> or <b>I</b> flag, the effect
      is to produce the index of the first character of the first/last word
      which matches the given pattern; note that a failed match in this case
      always yields 0.</dd>
  <dt><b>s:</b><i>string</i><b>:</b></dt>
  <dd>This gives the <i>string</i> that separates words (for use with the
      <b>w</b> flag). The delimiter character <b>:</b> is arbitrary; see
    above.</dd>
  <dt><b>p</b></dt>
  <dd>Recognize the same escape sequences as the <b>print</b> builtin in the
      string argument of a subsequent `<b>s</b>' flag.</dd>
  <dt><b>f</b></dt>
  <dd>If the parameter subscripted is a scalar then this flag makes subscripting
      work on lines instead of characters, i.e. with elements separated by
      newlines. This is a shorthand for `<b>pws:\n:</b>'.</dd>
  <dt><b>r</b></dt>
  <dd>Reverse subscripting: if this flag is given, the <i>exp</i> is taken as a
      pattern and the result is the first matching array element, substring or
      word (if the parameter is an array, if it is a scalar, or if it is a
      scalar and the `<b>w</b>' flag is given, respectively). The subscript used
      is the number of the matching element, so that pairs of subscripts such as
      `<b>$foo[(r)??,3]</b>' and `<b>$foo[(r)??,(r)f*]</b>' are possible if the
      parameter is not an associative array. If the parameter is an associative
      array, only the value part of each pair is compared to the pattern, and
      the result is that value.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">If a search through an ordinary array failed, the search sets the
    subscript to one past the end of the array, and hence
    <b>${array[(r)</b><i>pattern</i><b>]}</b> will substitute the empty string.
    Thus the success of a search can be tested by using the <b>(i)</b> flag, for
    example (assuming the option <b>KSH_ARRAYS</b> is not in effect):</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b>[[ ${array[(i)pattern]} -le ${#array} ]]</b>
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">If <b>KSH_ARRAYS</b> is in effect, the <b>-le</b> should be
    replaced by <b>-lt</b>.</p>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>R</b></dt>
  <dd>Like `<b>r</b>', but gives the last match. For associative arrays, gives
      all possible matches. May be used for assigning to ordinary array
      elements, but not for assigning to associative arrays. On failure, for
      normal arrays this has the effect of returning the element corresponding
      to subscript 0; this is empty unless one of the options <b>KSH_ARRAYS</b>
      or <b>KSH_ZERO_SUBSCRIPT</b> is in effect.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">Note that in subscripts with both `<b>r</b>' and `<b>R</b>'
    pattern characters are active even if they were substituted for a parameter
    (regardless of the setting of <b>GLOB_SUBST</b> which controls this feature
    in normal pattern matching). The flag `<b>e</b>' can be added to inhibit
    pattern matching. As this flag does not inhibit other forms of substitution,
    care is still required; using a parameter to hold the key has the desired
    effect:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b>key2='original key'</b>
<b>print ${array[(Re)$key2]}</b>
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>i</b></dt>
  <dd>Like `<b>r</b>', but gives the index of the match instead; this may not be
      combined with a second argument. On the left side of an assignment,
      behaves like `<b>r</b>'. For associative arrays, the key part of each pair
      is compared to the pattern, and the first matching key found is the
      result. On failure substitutes the length of the array plus one, as
      discussed under the description of `<b>r</b>', or the empty string for an
      associative array.</dd>
  <dt><b>I</b></dt>
  <dd>Like `<b>i</b>', but gives the index of the last match, or all possible
      matching keys in an associative array. On failure substitutes 0, or the
      empty string for an associative array. This flag is best when testing for
      values or keys that do not exist.</dd>
  <dt><b>k</b></dt>
  <dd>If used in a subscript on an associative array, this flag causes the keys
      to be interpreted as patterns, and returns the value for the first key
      found where <i>exp</i> is matched by the key. Note this could be any such
      key as no ordering of associative arrays is defined. This flag does not
      work on the left side of an assignment to an associative array element. If
      used on another type of parameter, this behaves like `<b>r</b>'.</dd>
  <dt><b>K</b></dt>
  <dd>On an associative array this is like `<b>k</b>' but returns all values
      where <i>exp</i> is matched by the keys. On other types of parameters this
      has the same effect as `<b>R</b>'.</dd>
  <dt><b>n:</b><i>expr</i><b>:</b></dt>
  <dd>If combined with `<b>r</b>', `<b>R</b>', `<b>i</b>' or `<b>I</b>', makes
      them give the <i>n</i>th or <i>n</i>th last match (if <i>expr</i>
      evaluates to <i>n</i>). This flag is ignored when the array is
      associative. The delimiter character <b>:</b> is arbitrary; see
    above.</dd>
  <dt><b>b:</b><i>expr</i><b>:</b></dt>
  <dd>If combined with `<b>r</b>', `<b>R</b>', `<b>i</b>' or `<b>I</b>', makes
      them begin at the <i>n</i>th or <i>n</i>th last element, word, or
      character (if <i>expr</i> evaluates to <i>n</i>). This flag is ignored
      when the array is associative. The delimiter character <b>:</b> is
      arbitrary; see above.</dd>
  <dt><b>e</b></dt>
  <dd>This flag causes any pattern matching that would be performed on the
      subscript to use plain string matching instead. Hence
      `<b>${array[(re)*]}</b>' matches only the array element whose value is
      <b>*</b>. Note that other forms of substitution such as parameter
      substitution are not inhibited.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">This flag can also be used to force <b>*</b> or <b>@</b> to be
    interpreted as a single key rather than as a reference to all values. It may
    be used for either purpose on the left side of an assignment.</p>

This discussion applies mainly to associative array key strings and to patterns
  used for reverse subscripting (the `<b>r</b>', `<b>R</b>', `<b>i</b>', etc.
  flags), but it may also affect parameter substitutions that appear as part of
  an arithmetic expression in an ordinary subscript.
<p class="Pp">To avoid subscript parsing limitations in assignments to
    associative array elements, use the append syntax:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b>aa+=('key with &quot;*strange*&quot; characters' 'value string')</b>
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The basic rule to remember when writing a subscript expression is
    that all text between the opening `<b>[</b>' and the closing `<b>]</b>' is
    interpreted <i>as if</i> it were in double quotes (see <i>zshmisc</i>(1)).
    However, unlike double quotes which normally cannot nest, subscript
    expressions may appear inside double-quoted strings or inside other
    subscript expressions (or both!), so the rules have two important
    differences.</p>
<p class="Pp">The first difference is that brackets (`<b>[</b>' and `<b>]</b>')
    must appear as balanced pairs in a subscript expression unless they are
    preceded by a backslash (`<b>\</b>'). Therefore, within a subscript
    expression (and unlike true double-quoting) the sequence `<b>\[</b>' becomes
    `<b>[</b>', and similarly `<b>\]</b>' becomes `<b>]</b>'. This applies even
    in cases where a backslash is not normally required; for example, the
    pattern `<b>[^[]</b>' (to match any character other than an open bracket)
    should be written `<b>[^\[]</b>' in a reverse-subscript pattern. However,
    note that `<b>\[^\[\]</b>' and even `<b>\[^[]</b>' mean the <i>same</i>
    thing, because backslashes are always stripped when they appear before
    brackets!</p>
<p class="Pp">The same rule applies to parentheses (`<b>(</b>' and `<b>)</b>')
    and braces (`<b>{</b>' and `<b>}</b>'): they must appear either in balanced
    pairs or preceded by a backslash, and backslashes that protect parentheses
    or braces are removed during parsing. This is because parameter expansions
    may be surrounded by balanced braces, and subscript flags are introduced by
    balanced parentheses.</p>
<p class="Pp">The second difference is that a double-quote (`<b>&quot;</b>') may
    appear as part of a subscript expression without being preceded by a
    backslash, and therefore that the two characters `<b>\&quot;</b>' remain as
    two characters in the subscript (in true double-quoting, `<b>\&quot;</b>'
    becomes `<b>&quot;</b>'). However, because of the standard shell quoting
    rules, any double-quotes that appear must occur in balanced pairs unless
    preceded by a backslash. This makes it more difficult to write a subscript
    expression that contains an odd number of double-quote characters, but the
    reason for this difference is so that when a subscript expression appears
    inside true double-quotes, one can still write `<b>\&quot;</b>' (rather than
    `<b>\\\&quot;</b>') for `<b>&quot;</b>'.</p>
<p class="Pp">To use an odd number of double quotes as a key in an assignment,
    use the <b>typeset</b> builtin and an enclosing pair of double quotes; to
    refer to the value of that key, again use double quotes:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b>typeset -A aa</b>
<b>typeset &quot;aa[one\&quot;two\&quot;three\&quot;quotes]&quot;=QQQ</b>
<b>print &quot;$aa[one\&quot;two\&quot;three\&quot;quotes]&quot;</b>
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">It is important to note that the quoting rules do not change when
    a parameter expansion with a subscript is nested inside another subscript
    expression. That is, it is not necessary to use additional backslashes
    within the inner subscript expression; they are removed only once, from the
    innermost subscript outwards. Parameters are also expanded from the
    innermost subscript first, as each expansion is encountered left to right in
    the outer expression.</p>
<p class="Pp">A further complication arises from a way in which subscript
    parsing is <i>not</i> different from double quote parsing. As in true
    double-quoting, the sequences `<b>\*</b>', and `<b>\@</b>' remain as two
    characters when they appear in a subscript expression. To use a literal
    `<b>*</b>' or `<b>@</b>' as an associative array key, the `<b>e</b>' flag
    must be used:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b>typeset -A aa</b>
<b>aa[(e)*]=star</b>
<b>print $aa[(e)*]</b>
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">A last detail must be considered when reverse subscripting is
    performed. Parameters appearing in the subscript expression are first
    expanded and then the complete expression is interpreted as a pattern. This
    has two effects: first, parameters behave as if <b>GLOB_SUBST</b> were on
    (and it cannot be turned off); second, backslashes are interpreted twice,
    once when parsing the array subscript and again when parsing the pattern. In
    a reverse subscript, it's necessary to use <i>four</i> backslashes to cause
    a single backslash to match literally in the pattern. For complex patterns,
    it is often easiest to assign the desired pattern to a parameter and then
    refer to that parameter in the subscript, because then the backslashes,
    brackets, parentheses, etc., are seen only when the complete expression is
    converted to a pattern. To match the value of a parameter literally in a
    reverse subscript, rather than as a pattern, use
    `<b>${(q</b><b>)</b><i>name</i><b>}</b>' (see <i>zshexpn</i>(1)) to quote
    the expanded value.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that the `<b>k</b>' and `<b>K</b>' flags are reverse
    subscripting for an ordinary array, but are <i>not</i> reverse subscripting
    for an associative array! (For an associative array, the keys in the array
    itself are interpreted as patterns by those flags; the subscript is a plain
    string in that case.)</p>
<p class="Pp">One final note, not directly related to subscripting: the numeric
    names of positional parameters (described below) are parsed specially, so
    for example `<b>$2foo</b>' is equivalent to `<b>${2}foo</b>'. Therefore, to
    use subscript syntax to extract a substring from a positional parameter, the
    expansion must be surrounded by braces; for example, `<b>${2[3,5]}</b>'
    evaluates to the third through fifth characters of the second positional
    parameter, but `<b>$2[3,5]</b>' is the entire second parameter concatenated
    with the filename generation pattern `<b>[3,5]</b>'.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="POSITIONAL_PARAMETERS"><a class="permalink" href="#POSITIONAL_PARAMETERS">POSITIONAL
  PARAMETERS</a></h1>
The positional parameters provide access to the command-line arguments of a
  shell function, shell script, or the shell itself; see the section
  `Invocation', and also the section `Functions'. The parameter <i>n</i>, where
  <i>n</i> is a number, is the <i>n</i>th positional parameter. The parameter
  `<b>$0</b>' is a special case, see the section `Parameters Set By The Shell'.
<p class="Pp">The parameters <b>*</b>, <b>@</b> and <b>argv</b> are arrays
    containing all the positional parameters; thus
    `<b>$argv[</b><i>n</i><b>]</b>', etc., is equivalent to simply
    `<b>$</b><i>n</i>'. Note that the options <b>KSH_ARRAYS</b> or
    <b>KSH_ZERO_SUBSCRIPT</b> apply to these arrays as well, so with either of
    those options set, `<b>${argv[0]}</b>' is equivalent to `<b>$1</b>' and so
    on.</p>
<p class="Pp">Positional parameters may be changed after the shell or function
    starts by using the <b>set</b> builtin, by assigning to the <b>argv</b>
    array, or by direct assignment of the form `<i>n</i><b>=</b><i>value</i>'
    where <i>n</i> is the number of the positional parameter to be changed. This
    also creates (with empty values) any of the positions from 1 to <i>n</i>
    that do not already have values. Note that, because the positional
    parameters form an array, an array assignment of the form
    `<i>n</i><b>=(</b><i>value</i> ...<b>)</b>' is allowed, and has the effect
    of shifting all the values at positions greater than <i>n</i> by as many
    positions as necessary to accommodate the new values.</p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="LOCAL_PARAMETERS"><a class="permalink" href="#LOCAL_PARAMETERS">LOCAL
  PARAMETERS</a></h1>
Shell function executions delimit scopes for shell parameters. (Parameters are
  dynamically scoped.) The <b>typeset</b> builtin, and its alternative forms
  <b>declare</b>, <b>integer</b>, <b>local</b> and <b>readonly</b> (but not
  <b>export</b>), can be used to declare a parameter as being local to the
  innermost scope.
<p class="Pp">When a parameter is read or assigned to, the innermost existing
    parameter of that name is used. (That is, the local parameter hides any
    less-local parameter.) However, assigning to a non-existent parameter, or
    declaring a new parameter with <b>export</b>, causes it to be created in the
    <i>outer</i>most scope.</p>
<p class="Pp">Local parameters disappear when their scope ends. <b>unset</b> can
    be used to delete a parameter while it is still in scope; any outer
    parameter of the same name remains hidden.</p>
<p class="Pp">Special parameters may also be made local; they retain their
    special attributes unless either the existing or the newly-created parameter
    has the <b>-h</b> (hide) attribute. This may have unexpected effects: there
    is no default value, so if there is no assignment at the point the variable
    is made local, it will be set to an empty value (or zero in the case of
    integers). The following:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b>typeset PATH=/new/directory:$PATH</b>
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">is valid for temporarily allowing the shell or programmes called
    from it to find the programs in <b>/new/directory</b> inside a function.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that the restriction in older versions of zsh that local
    parameters were never exported has been removed.</p>

In the parameter lists that follow, the mark `&lt;S&gt;' indicates that the

<p class="Pp">The following parameters are automatically set by the shell:</p>

  <dt><b>#</b> &lt;S&gt;</dt>
  <dd>The number of positional parameters in decimal. Note that some confusion
      may occur with the syntax <b>$#</b><i>param</i> which substitutes the
      length of <i>param</i>. Use <b>${#}</b> to resolve ambiguities. In
      particular, the sequence `<b>$#-</b><i>...</i>' in an arithmetic

  <dt><b>$</b> &lt;S&gt;</dt>
  <dd>The process ID of this shell. Note that this indicates the original shell
      started by invoking <b>zsh</b>; all processes forked from the shells
      without executing a new program, such as subshells started by
      <b>(</b><i>...</i><b>)</b>, substitute the same value.</dd>

      Deleting <b>argv</b> with <b>unset</b> in any function deletes it

<h1 class="Sh" id="PARAMETERS_USED_BY_THE_SHELL"><a class="permalink" href="#PARAMETERS_USED_BY_THE_SHELL">PARAMETERS
  USED BY THE SHELL</a></h1>
The following parameters are used by the shell. Again, `&lt;S&gt;' indicates
  that the parameter is special and `&lt;Z&gt;' indicates that the parameter
  does not exist when the shell initializes in <b>sh</b> or <b>ksh</b> emulation
  mode.
<p class="Pp">In cases where there are two parameters with an upper- and
    lowercase form of the same name, such as <b>path</b> and <b>PATH</b>, the
    lowercase form is an array and the uppercase form is a scalar with the
    elements of the array joined together by colons. These are similar to tied
    parameters created via `<b>typeset -T</b>'. The normal use for the
    colon-separated form is for exporting to the environment, while the array
    form is easier to manipulate within the shell. Note that unsetting either of
    the pair will unset the other; they retain their special properties when
    recreated, and recreating one of the pair will recreate the other.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>ARGV0</b></dt>
  <dd>If exported, its value is used as the <b>argv[0]</b> of external commands.
      Usually used in constructs like `<b>ARGV0=emacs nethack</b>'.</dd>
  <dt><b>BAUD</b></dt>
  <dd>The rate in bits per second at which data reaches the terminal. The line
      editor will use this value in order to compensate for a slow terminal by
      delaying updates to the display until necessary. If the parameter is unset
      or the value is zero the compensation mechanism is turned off. The
      parameter is not set by default.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">This parameter may be profitably set in some circumstances, e.g.
    for slow modems dialing into a communications server, or on a slow wide area
    network. It should be set to the baud rate of the slowest part of the link
    for best performance.</p>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>cdpath</b> &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt; (<b>CDPATH</b> &lt;S&gt;)</dt>
  <dd>An array (colon-separated list) of directories specifying the search path
      for the <b>cd</b> command.</dd>
  <dt><b>COLUMNS</b> &lt;S&gt;</dt>
  <dd>The number of columns for this terminal session. Used for printing select
      lists and for the line editor.</dd>
  <dt><b>CORRECT_IGNORE</b></dt>
  <dd>If set, is treated as a pattern during spelling correction. Any potential
      correction that matches the pattern is ignored. For example, if the value
      is `<b>_*</b>' then completion functions (which, by convention, have names
      beginning with `<b>_</b>') will never be offered as spelling corrections.
      The pattern does not apply to the correction of file names, as applied by
      the <b>CORRECT_ALL</b> option (so with the example just given files
      beginning with `<b>_</b>' in the current directory would still be
      completed).</dd>
  <dt><b>CORRECT_IGNORE_FILE</b></dt>
  <dd>If set, is treated as a pattern during spelling correction of file names.
      Any file name that matches the pattern is never offered as a correction.
      For example, if the value is `<b>.*</b>' then dot file names will never be
      offered as spelling corrections. This is useful with the
      <b>CORRECT_ALL</b> option.</dd>
  <dt><b>DIRSTACKSIZE</b></dt>
  <dd>The maximum size of the directory stack, by default there is no limit. If
      the stack gets larger than this, it will be truncated automatically. This
      is useful with the <b>AUTO_PUSHD</b> option.</dd>
  <dt><b>ENV</b></dt>
  <dd>If the <b>ENV</b> environment variable is set when zsh is invoked as
      <b>sh</b> or <b>ksh</b>, <b>$ENV</b> is sourced after the profile scripts.
      The value of <b>ENV</b> is subjected to parameter expansion, command
      substitution, and arithmetic expansion before being interpreted as a
      pathname. Note that <b>ENV</b> is <i>not</i> used unless the shell is
      interactive and zsh is emulating <b>sh</b> or <b>ksh</b>.</dd>
  <dt><b>FCEDIT</b></dt>
  <dd>The default editor for the <b>fc</b> builtin. If <b>FCEDIT</b> is not set,
      the parameter <b>EDITOR</b> is used; if that is not set either, a builtin
      default, usually <b>vi</b>, is used.</dd>
  <dt><b>fignore</b> &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt; (<b>FIGNORE</b> &lt;S&gt;)</dt>
  <dd>An array (colon separated list) containing the suffixes of files to be
      ignored during filename completion. However, if completion only generates
      files with suffixes in this list, then these files are completed
    anyway.</dd>
  <dt><b>fpath</b> &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt; (<b>FPATH</b> &lt;S&gt;)</dt>
  <dd>An array (colon separated list) of directories specifying the search path
      for function definitions. This path is searched when a function with the
      <b>-u</b> attribute is referenced. If an executable file is found, then it
      is read and executed in the current environment.</dd>
  <dt><b>histchars</b> &lt;S&gt;</dt>
  <dd>Three characters used by the shell's history and lexical analysis
      mechanism. The first character signals the start of a history expansion
      (default `<b>!</b>'). The second character signals the start of a quick
      history substitution (default `<b>^</b>'). The third character is the
      comment character (default `<b>#</b>').</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">The characters must be in the ASCII character set; any attempt to
    set <b>histchars</b> to characters with a locale-dependent meaning will be
    rejected with an error message.</p>

  <dt><b>HISTCHARS</b> &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt;</dt>
  <dd>Same as <b>histchars</b>. (Deprecated.)</dd>
  <dt><b>HISTFILE</b></dt>
  <dd>The file to save the history in when an interactive shell exits. If unset,
      the history is not saved.</dd>
  <dt><b>HISTORY_IGNORE</b></dt>
  <dd>If set, is treated as a pattern at the time history files are written. Any
      potential history entry that matches the pattern is skipped. For example,
      if the value is `<b>fc *</b>' then commands that invoke the interactive
      history editor are never written to the history file.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">Note that <b>HISTORY_IGNORE</b> defines a single pattern: to
    specify alternatives use the
    `<b>(</b><i>first</i><b>|</b><i>second</i><b>|</b><i>...</i><b>)</b>'
    syntax.</p>
<p class="Pp">Compare the <b>HIST_NO_STORE</b> option or the
    <b>zshaddhistory</b> hook, either of which would prevent such commands from
    being added to the interactive history at all. If you wish to use
    <b>HISTORY_IGNORE</b> to stop history being added in the first place, you
    can define the following hook:</p>

      white space character together with any adjacent IFS white space character
      delimit a field. If an IFS white space character appears twice

      intended to fix the problem with keys placed annoyingly close to return
      and replaces the <b>SUNKEYBOARDHACK</b> option which did this for

  <dt><b>LANG</b> &lt;S&gt;</dt>
  <dd>This variable determines the locale category for any category not

  <dt><b>LC_COLLATE</b> &lt;S&gt;</dt>
  <dd>This variable determines the locale category for character collation
      information within ranges in glob brackets and for sorting.</dd>
  <dt><b>LC_CTYPE</b> &lt;S&gt;</dt>
  <dd>This variable determines the locale category for character handling
      functions. If the <b>MULTIBYTE</b> option is in effect this variable or
      <b>LANG</b> should contain a value that reflects the character set in use,
      even if it is a single-byte character set, unless only the 7-bit subset
      (ASCII) is used. For example, if the character set is ISO-8859-1, a
      suitable value might be <b>en_US.iso88591</b> (certain Linux
      distributions) or <b>en_US.ISO8859-1</b> (MacOS).</dd>
  <dt><b>LC_MESSAGES</b> &lt;S&gt;</dt>
  <dd>This variable determines the language in which messages should be written.
      Note that zsh does not use message catalogs.</dd>
  <dt><b>LC_NUMERIC</b> &lt;S&gt;</dt>
  <dd>This variable affects the decimal point character and thousands separator
      character for the formatted input/output functions and string conversion
      functions. Note that zsh ignores this setting when parsing floating point
      mathematical expressions.</dd>
  <dt><b>LC_TIME</b> &lt;S&gt;</dt>
  <dd>This variable determines the locale category for date and time formatting

  <dd>The number of lines for this terminal session. Used for printing select
      lists and for the line editor.</dd>
  <dt><b>LISTMAX</b></dt>
  <dd>In the line editor, the number of matches to list without asking first. If
      the value is negative, the list will be shown if it spans at most as many

  <dd>The interval in seconds between checks for new mail.</dd>
  <dt><b>mailpath</b> &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt; (<b>MAILPATH</b> &lt;S&gt;)</dt>
  <dd>An array (colon-separated list) of filenames to check for new mail. Each

      builtins it will see the modes specified by <b>STTY</b>, as if it were not
      suspended. This (intentionally) does not apply if the command is continued
      via `<b>kill</b> <b>-CONT</b>'. <b>STTY</b> is ignored if the command is
      run in the background, or if it is in the environment of the shell but not
      explicitly assigned to in the input line. This avoids running stty at
      every external command by accidentally exporting it. Also note that
      <b>STTY</b> should not be used for window size specifications; these will
      not be local to the command.</dd>
  <dt><b>TERM</b> &lt;S&gt;</dt>
  <dd>The type of terminal in use. This is used when looking up termcap
      sequences. An assignment to <b>TERM</b> causes zsh to re-initialize the
      terminal, even if the value does not change (e.g., `<b>TERM=$TERM</b>').
      It is necessary to make such an assignment upon any change to the terminal
      definition database or terminal type in order for the new settings to take
      effect.</dd>
  <dt><b>TERMINFO</b> &lt;S&gt;</dt>
  <dd>A reference to your terminfo database, used by the `terminfo' library when
      the system has it; see <i>terminfo</i>(5). If set, this causes the shell
      to reinitialise the terminal, making the workaround `<b>TERM=$TERM</b>'
      unnecessary.</dd>
  <dt><b>TERMINFO_DIRS</b> &lt;S&gt;</dt>
  <dd>A colon-seprarated list of terminfo databases, used by the `terminfo'
      library when the system has it; see <i>terminfo</i>(5). This variable is
      only used by certain terminal libraries, in particular ncurses; see
      <i>terminfo</i>(5) to check support on your system. If set, this causes
      the shell to reinitialise the terminal, making the workaround
      `<b>TERM=$TERM</b>' unnecessary. Note that unlike other colon-separated
      arrays this is not tied to a zsh array.</dd>
  <dt><b>TIMEFMT</b></dt>
  <dd>The format of process time reports with the <b>time</b> keyword. The
      default is `<b>%J %U user %S system %P cpu %*E total</b>'. Recognizes the

<p class="Pp">A star may be inserted between the percent sign and flags printing

  <dt><b>watch</b> &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt; (<b>WATCH</b> &lt;S&gt;)</dt>
  <dd>An array (colon-separated list) of login/logout events to report.</dd>

<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">If it contains the single word `<b>all</b>', then all login/logout

  <dt><b>%(</b><i>x</i><b>:</b><i>true-text</i><b>:</b><i>false-text</i><b>)</b></dt>
  <dd>Specifies a ternary expression. The character following the <i>x</i> is
      arbitrary; the same character is used to separate the text for the
      &quot;true&quot; result from that for the &quot;false&quot; result. Both
      the separator and the right parenthesis may be escaped with a backslash.
      Ternary expressions may be nested.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">The test character <i>x</i> may be any one of `<b>l</b>',

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>WORDCHARS</b> &lt;S&gt;</dt>
  <dd>A list of non-alphanumeric characters considered part of a word by the

  <dt><b>ZBEEP</b></dt>
  <dd>If set, this gives a string of characters, which can use all the same
      codes as the <b>bindkey</b> command as described in the zsh/zle module
      entry in <i>zshmodules</i>(1), that will be output to the terminal instead
      of beeping. This may have a visible instead of an audible effect; for
      example, the string `<b>\e[?5h\e[?5l</b>' on a vt100 or xterm will have
      the effect of flashing reverse video on and off (if you usually use
      reverse video, you should use the string `<b>\e[?5l\e[?5h</b>' instead).
      This takes precedence over the <b>NOBEEP</b> option.</dd>
  <dt><b>ZDOTDIR</b></dt>
  <dd>The directory to search for shell startup files (.zshrc, etc), if not
      <b>$HOME</b>.</dd>
  <dt><b>zle_bracketed_paste</b></dt>
  <dd>Many terminal emulators have a feature that allows applications to
      identify when text is pasted into the terminal rather than being typed
      normally. For ZLE, this means that special characters such as tabs and
      newlines can be inserted instead of invoking editor commands. Furthermore,
      pasted text forms a single undo event and if the region is active, pasted
      text will replace the region.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">This two-element array contains the terminal escape sequences for
    enabling and disabling the feature. These escape sequences are used to
    enable bracketed paste when ZLE is active and disable it at other times.
    Unsetting the parameter has the effect of ensuring that bracketed paste
    remains disabled.</p>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>zle_highlight</b></dt>
  <dd>An array describing contexts in which ZLE should highlight the input text.
      See <i>Character Highlighting</i> in <i>zshzle</i>(1).</dd>
  <dt><b>ZLE_LINE_ABORTED</b></dt>
  <dd>This parameter is set by the line editor when an error occurs. It contains
      the line that was being edited at the point of the error. `<b>print -zr --
      $ZLE_LINE_ABORTED</b>' can be used to recover the line. Only the most
      recent line of this kind is remembered.</dd>
  <dt><b>ZLE_REMOVE_SUFFIX_CHARS</b></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>ZLE_SPACE_SUFFIX_CHARS</b></dt>
  <dd>These parameters are used by the line editor. In certain circumstances
      suffixes (typically space or slash) added by the completion system will be
      removed automatically, either because the next editing command was not an
      insertable character, or because the character was marked as requiring the
      suffix to be removed.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">These variables can contain the sets of characters that will cause
    the suffix to be removed. If <b>ZLE_REMOVE_SUFFIX_CHARS</b> is set, those
    characters will cause the suffix to be removed; if
    <b>ZLE_SPACE_SUFFIX_CHARS</b> is set, those characters will cause the suffix
    to be removed and replaced by a space.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <b>ZLE_REMOVE_SUFFIX_CHARS</b> is not set, the default
    behaviour is equivalent to:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b>ZLE_REMOVE_SUFFIX_CHARS=$' \t\n;&amp;|'</b>
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">If <b>ZLE_REMOVE_SUFFIX_CHARS</b> is set but is empty, no
    characters have this behaviour. <b>ZLE_SPACE_SUFFIX_CHARS</b> takes
    precedence, so that the following:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b>ZLE_SPACE_SUFFIX_CHARS=$'&amp;|'</b>
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">causes the characters `<b>&amp;</b>' and `<b>|</b>' to remove the
    suffix but to replace it with a space.</p>
<p class="Pp">To illustrate the difference, suppose that the option
    <b>AUTO_REMOVE_SLASH</b> is in effect and the directory <b>DIR</b> has just
    been completed, with an appended <b>/</b>, following which the user types
    `<b>&amp;</b>'. The default result is `<b>DIR&amp;</b>'. With
    <b>ZLE_REMOVE_SUFFIX_CHARS</b> set but without including `<b>&amp;</b>' the
    result is `<b>DIR/&amp;</b>'. With <b>ZLE_SPACE_SUFFIX_CHARS</b> set to
    include `<b>&amp;</b>' the result is `<b>DIR &amp;</b>'.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that certain completions may provide their own suffix removal
    or replacement behaviour which overrides the values described here. See the
    completion system documentation in <i>zshcompsys</i>(1).</p>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>ZLE_RPROMPT_INDENT</b> &lt;S&gt;</dt>
  <dd>If set, used to give the indentation between the right hand side of the

      and the right hand side of the screen. If not set, the value 1 is
    used.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">Typically this will be used to set the value to 0 so that the
    prompt appears flush with the right hand side of the screen. This is not the
    default as many terminals do not handle this correctly, in particular when
    the prompt appears at the extreme bottom right of the screen. Recent virtual
    terminals are more likely to handle this case correctly. Some
    experimentation is necessary.</p>
