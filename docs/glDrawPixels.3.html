<b>glDrawPixels</b> reads pixel data from memory and writes it into the frame
  buffer
<br/>
relative to the current raster position, provided that the raster position is
  valid. Use
<br/>
<b>glRasterPos</b> to set the current raster position; use <b>glGet</b> with
  argument <b>GL_CURRENT_RASTER_POSITION_VALID</b> to determine if the specified
  raster position is valid, and <b>glGet</b> with argument
  <b>GL_CURRENT_RASTER_POSITION</b> to query the raster position.
<p class="Pp">Several parameters define the encoding of pixel data in memory and
    control the processing of the pixel data before it is placed in the frame
    buffer. These parameters are set with four commands: <b>glPixelStore</b>,
    <b>glPixelTransfer</b>, <b>glPixelMap</b>, and <b>glPixelZoom</b>. This
    reference page describes the effects on <b>glDrawPixels</b> of many, but not
    all, of the parameters specified by these four commands.</p>
<p class="Pp">Data is read from <i>pixels</i> as a sequence of signed or
    unsigned bytes, signed or unsigned shorts, signed or unsigned integers, or
    single-precision floating-point values, depending on <i>type</i>. When
    <i>type</i> is one of <b>GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE</b>, <b>GL_BYTE</b>,
    <b>GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT</b>, <b>GL_SHORT</b>, <b>GL_UNSIGNED_INT</b>,
    <b>GL_INT</b>, or <b>GL_FLOAT</b> each of these bytes, shorts, integers, or
    floating-point values is interpreted as one color or depth component, or one
    index, depending on <i>format</i>. When <i>type</i> is one of
    <b>GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE_3_3_2</b>, <b>GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT_5_6_5</b>,
    <b>GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT_4_4_4_4</b>, <b>GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT_5_5_5_1</b>,
    <b>GL_UNSIGNED_INT_8_8_8_8</b>, <b>GL_UNSIGNED_INT_10_10_10_2</b>, each
    unsigned value is interpreted as containing all the components for a single
    pixel, with the color components arranged according to <i>format</i>. When
    <i>type</i> is one of <b>GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE_2_3_3_REV</b>,
    <b>GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT_5_6_5_REV</b>, <b>GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT_4_4_4_4_REV</b>,
    <b>GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT_1_5_5_5_REV</b>, <b>GL_UNSIGNED_INT_8_8_8_8_REV</b>,
    <b>GL_UNSIGNED_INT_2_10_10_10_REV</b>, each unsigned value is interpreted as
    containing all color components, specified by <i>format</i>, for a single
    pixel in a reversed order. Indices are always treated individually. Color
    components are treated as groups of one, two, three, or four values, again
    based on <i>format</i>. Both individual indices and groups of components are
    referred to as pixels. If <i>type</i> is <b>GL_BITMAP</b>, the data must be
    unsigned bytes, and <i>format</i> must be either <b>GL_COLOR_INDEX</b> or
    <b>GL_STENCIL_INDEX</b>. Each unsigned byte is treated as eight 1-bit
    pixels, with bit ordering determined by <b>GL_UNPACK_LSB_FIRST</b> (see
    <b>glPixelStore</b>).</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>width</i> * <i>height</i> pixels are read from memory, starting
    at location <i>pixels</i>. By default, these pixels are taken from adjacent
    memory locations, except that after all <i>width</i> pixels are read, the
    read pointer is advanced to the next four-byte boundary. The four-byte row
    alignment is specified by <b>glPixelStore</b> with argument
    <b>GL_UNPACK_ALIGNMENT</b>, and it can be set to one, two, four, or eight
    bytes. Other pixel store parameters specify different read pointer
    advancements, both before the first pixel is read and after all <i>width</i>
    pixels are read. See the <b>glPixelStore</b> reference page for details on
    these options.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>width</i> * <i>height</i> pixels that are read from memory
    are each operated on in the same way, based on the values of several
    parameters specified by <b>glPixelTransfer</b> and <b>glPixelMap</b>. The
    details of these operations, as well as the target buffer into which the
    pixels are drawn, are specific to the format of the pixels, as specified by
    <i>format</i>. <i>format</i> can assume one of 13 symbolic values:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>GL_COLOR_INDEX</b></dt>
  <dd>Each pixel is a single value, a color index. It is converted to
      fixed-point , with an unspecified number of bits to the right of the
      binary point, regardless of the memory data type. Floating-point values
      convert to true fixed-point values. Signed and unsigned integer data is
      converted with all fraction bits set to 0. Bitmap data convert to either 0
      or 1.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">

  <dd>Each fixed-point index is then shifted left by <b>GL_INDEX_SHIFT</b> bits
      and added to <b>GL_INDEX_OFFSET</b>. If <b>GL_INDEX_SHIFT</b> is negative,
      the shift is to the right. In either case, zero bits fill otherwise
      unspecified bit locations in the result.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>If the GL is in RGBA mode, the resulting index is converted to an RGBA
      pixel with the help of the <b>GL_PIXEL_MAP_I_TO_R</b>,
      <b>GL_PIXEL_MAP_I_TO_G</b>, <b>GL_PIXEL_MAP_I_TO_B</b>, and
      <b>GL_PIXEL_MAP_I_TO_A</b> tables. If the GL is in color index mode, and
      if <b>GL_MAP_COLOR</b> is true, the index is replaced with the value that
      it references in lookup table <b>GL_PIXEL_MAP_I_TO_I</b>. Whether the
