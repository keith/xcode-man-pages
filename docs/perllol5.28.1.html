  and Access of Arrays of Arrays</a></h2>
The simplest two-level data structure to build in Perl is an array of arrays,
  sometimes casually called a list of lists. It's reasonably easy to understand,
  and almost everything that applies here will also be applicable later on with
  the fancier data structures.
<p class="Pp">An array of an array is just a regular old array
    <span class="Li">@AoA</span> that you can get at with two subscripts, like
    <span class="Li">$AoA[3][2]</span>. Here's a declaration of the array:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    use 5.010;  # so we can use say()

    # assign to our array, an array of array references
    @AoA = (
           [ &quot;fred&quot;, &quot;barney&quot;, &quot;pebbles&quot;, &quot;bambam&quot;, &quot;dino&quot;, ],
           [ &quot;george&quot;, &quot;jane&quot;, &quot;elroy&quot;, &quot;judy&quot;, ],
           [ &quot;homer&quot;, &quot;bart&quot;, &quot;marge&quot;, &quot;maggie&quot;, ],
    );
    say $AoA[2][1];
  bart
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Now you should be very careful that the outer bracket type is a
    round one, that is, a parenthesis. That's because you're assigning to an
    <span class="Li">@array</span>, so you need parentheses. If you wanted there
    <i>not</i> to be an <span class="Li">@AoA</span>, but rather just a
    reference to it, you could do something more like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    # assign a reference to array of array references
    $ref_to_AoA = [
        [ &quot;fred&quot;, &quot;barney&quot;, &quot;pebbles&quot;, &quot;bambam&quot;, &quot;dino&quot;, ],
        [ &quot;george&quot;, &quot;jane&quot;, &quot;elroy&quot;, &quot;judy&quot;, ],
        [ &quot;homer&quot;, &quot;bart&quot;, &quot;marge&quot;, &quot;maggie&quot;, ],
    ];
    say $ref_to_AoA-&gt;[2][1];
  bart
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Notice that the outer bracket type has changed, and so our access
    syntax has also changed. That's because unlike C, in perl you can't freely
    interchange arrays and references thereto.
    <span class="Li">$ref_to_AoA</span> is a reference to an array, whereas
    <span class="Li">@AoA</span> is an array proper. Likewise,
    <span class="Li">$AoA[2]</span> is not an array, but an array ref. So how
    come you can write these:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    $AoA[2][2]
    $ref_to_AoA-&gt;[2][2]
</pre>
<p class="Pp">instead of having to write these:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    $AoA[2]-&gt;[2]
    $ref_to_AoA-&gt;[2]-&gt;[2]
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Well, that's because the rule is that on adjacent brackets only
    (whether square or curly), you are free to omit the pointer dereferencing
    arrow. But you cannot do so for the very first one if it's a scalar
    containing a reference, which means that <span class="Li">$ref_to_AoA</span>
    always needs it.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Growing_Your_Own"><a class="permalink" href="#Growing_Your_Own">Growing
  Your Own</a></h2>
That's all well and good for declaration of a fixed data structure, but what if
  you wanted to add new elements on the fly, or build it up entirely from
  scratch?
<p class="Pp">First, let's look at reading it in from a file. This is something
    like adding a row at a time. We'll assume that there's a flat file in which
    each line is a row and each word an element. If you're trying to develop an
    <span class="Li">@AoA</span> array containing all these, here's the right
    way to do that:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    while (&lt;&gt;) {
        @tmp = split;
        push @AoA, [ @tmp ];
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">You might also have loaded that from a function:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    for $i ( 1 .. 10 ) {
        $AoA[$i] = [ somefunc($i) ];
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Or you might have had a temporary variable sitting around with the
    array in it.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    for $i ( 1 .. 10 ) {
        @tmp = somefunc($i);
        $AoA[$i] = [ @tmp ];
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">It's important you make sure to use the <span class="Li">&quot;[
    ]&quot;</span> array reference constructor. That's because this wouldn't
    work:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    $AoA[$i] = @tmp;   # WRONG!
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The reason that doesn't do what you want is because assigning a
    named array like that to a scalar is taking an array in scalar context,
    which means just counts the number of elements in
    <span class="Li">@tmp</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you are running under <span class="Li">&quot;use
    strict&quot;</span> (and if you aren't, why in the world aren't you?),
    you'll have to add some declarations to make it happy:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    use strict;
    my(@AoA, @tmp);
    while (&lt;&gt;) {
        @tmp = split;
        push @AoA, [ @tmp ];
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Of course, you don't need the temporary array to have a name at
    all:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    while (&lt;&gt;) {
        push @AoA, [ split ];
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">You also don't have to use <b>push()</b>. You could just make a
    direct assignment if you knew where you wanted to put it:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    my (@AoA, $i, $line);
    for $i ( 0 .. 10 ) {
        $line = &lt;&gt;;
        $AoA[$i] = [ split &quot; &quot;, $line ];
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">or even just</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    my (@AoA, $i);
    for $i ( 0 .. 10 ) {
        $AoA[$i] = [ split &quot; &quot;, &lt;&gt; ];
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">You should in general be leery of using functions that could
    potentially return lists in scalar context without explicitly stating such.
    This would be clearer to the casual reader:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    my (@AoA, $i);
    for $i ( 0 .. 10 ) {
        $AoA[$i] = [ split &quot; &quot;, scalar(&lt;&gt;) ];
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If you wanted to have a <span class="Li">$ref_to_AoA</span>
    variable as a reference to an array, you'd have to do something like
  this:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    while (&lt;&gt;) {
        push @$ref_to_AoA, [ split ];
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Now you can add new rows. What about adding new columns? If you're
    dealing with just matrices, it's often easiest to use simple assignment:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    for $x (1 .. 10) {
        for $y (1 .. 10) {
            $AoA[$x][$y] = func($x, $y);
        }
    }

    for $x ( 3, 7, 9 ) {
        $AoA[$x][20] += func2($x);
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">It doesn't matter whether those elements are already there or not:
    it'll gladly create them for you, setting intervening elements to
    <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> as need be.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you wanted just to append to a row, you'd have to do something
    a bit funnier looking:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    # add new columns to an existing row
    push @{ $AoA[0] }, &quot;wilma&quot;, &quot;betty&quot;;   # explicit deref
</pre>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Access_and_Printing"><a class="permalink" href="#Access_and_Printing">Access
  and Printing</a></h2>
Now it's time to print your data structure out. How are you going to do that?
  Well, if you want only one of the elements, it's trivial:
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    print $AoA[0][0];
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If you want to print the whole thing, though, you can't say</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    print @AoA;         # WRONG
</pre>
<p class="Pp">because you'll get just references listed, and perl will never
    automatically dereference things for you. Instead, you have to roll yourself
    a loop or two. This prints the whole structure, using the shell-style
    <b>for()</b> construct to loop across the outer set of subscripts.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    for $aref ( @AoA ) {
        say &quot;\t [ @$aref ],&quot;;
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If you wanted to keep track of subscripts, you might do this:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    for $i ( 0 .. $#AoA ) {
        say &quot;\t elt $i is [ @{$AoA[$i]} ],&quot;;
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">or maybe even this. Notice the inner loop.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    for $i ( 0 .. $#AoA ) {
        for $j ( 0 .. $#{$AoA[$i]} ) {
            say &quot;elt $i $j is $AoA[$i][$j]&quot;;
        }
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">As you can see, it's getting a bit complicated. That's why
    sometimes is easier to take a temporary on your way through:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    for $i ( 0 .. $#AoA ) {
        $aref = $AoA[$i];
        for $j ( 0 .. $#{$aref} ) {
            say &quot;elt $i $j is $AoA[$i][$j]&quot;;
        }
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Hmm... that's still a bit ugly. How about this:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    for $i ( 0 .. $#AoA ) {
        $aref = $AoA[$i];
        $n = @$aref - 1;
        for $j ( 0 .. $n ) {
            say &quot;elt $i $j is $AoA[$i][$j]&quot;;
        }
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">When you get tired of writing a custom print for your data
    structures, you might look at the standard Dumpvalue or Data::Dumper
    modules. The former is what the Perl debugger uses, while the latter
    generates parsable Perl code. For example:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
 use v5.14;     # using the + prototype, new to v5.14

 sub show(+) {
        require Dumpvalue;
        state $prettily = new Dumpvalue::
                            tick        =&gt; q(&quot;),
                            compactDump =&gt; 1,  # comment these two lines
                                               # out
                            veryCompact =&gt; 1,  # if you want a bigger
                                               # dump
                        ;
        dumpValue $prettily @_;
 }

 # Assign a list of array references to an array.
 my @AoA = (
           [ &quot;fred&quot;, &quot;barney&quot; ],
           [ &quot;george&quot;, &quot;jane&quot;, &quot;elroy&quot; ],
           [ &quot;homer&quot;, &quot;marge&quot;, &quot;bart&quot; ],
 );
 push @{ $AoA[0] }, &quot;wilma&quot;, &quot;betty&quot;;
 show @AoA;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">will print out:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Slices"><a class="permalink" href="#Slices">Slices</a></h2>
If you want to get at a slice (part of a row) in a multidimensional array,
  you're going to have to do some fancy subscripting. That's because while we
  have a nice synonym for single elements via the pointer arrow for
  dereferencing, no such convenience exists for slices.
<p class="Pp">Here's how to do one operation using a loop. We'll assume an
    <span class="Li">@AoA</span> variable as before.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    @part = ();
    $x = 4;
    for ($y = 7; $y &lt; 13; $y++) {
        push @part, $AoA[$x][$y];
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">That same loop could be replaced with a slice operation:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    @part = @{$AoA[4]}[7..12];
</pre>
<p class="Pp">or spaced out a bit:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    @part = @{ $AoA[4] } [ 7..12 ];
</pre>
<p class="Pp">But as you might well imagine, this can get pretty rough on the
    reader.</p>
<p class="Pp">Ah, but what if you wanted a <i>two-dimensional slice</i>, such as
    having <span class="Li">$x</span> run from 4..8 and
    <span class="Li">$y</span> run from 7 to 12? Hmm... here's the simple
  way:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    @newAoA = ();
    for ($startx = $x = 4; $x &lt;= 8; $x++) {
        for ($starty = $y = 7; $y &lt;= 12; $y++) {
            $newAoA[$x - $startx][$y - $starty] = $AoA[$x][$y];
        }
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">We can reduce some of the looping through slices</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    for ($x = 4; $x &lt;= 8; $x++) {
        push @newAoA, [ @{ $AoA[$x] } [ 7..12 ] ];
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If you were into Schwartzian Transforms, you would probably have
    selected map for that</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    @newAoA = map { [ @{ $AoA[$_] } [ 7..12 ] ] } 4 .. 8;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Although if your manager accused you of seeking job security (or
    rapid insecurity) through inscrutable code, it would be hard to argue. :-)
    If I were you, I'd put that in a function:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    @newAoA = splice_2D( \@AoA, 4 =&gt; 8, 7 =&gt; 12 );
    sub splice_2D {
        my $lrr = shift;        # ref to array of array refs!
        my ($x_lo, $x_hi,
            $y_lo, $y_hi) = @_;

        return map {
            [ @{ $lrr-&gt;[$_] } [ $y_lo .. $y_hi ] ]
        } $x_lo .. $x_hi;
