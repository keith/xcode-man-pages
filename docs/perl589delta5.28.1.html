perl589delta - what is new for perl v5.8.9
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
This document describes differences between the 5.8.8 release and the 5.8.9
  release.
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="Notice"><a class="permalink" href="#Notice">Notice</a></h1>
The 5.8.9 release will be the last significant release of the 5.8.x series. Any
  future releases of 5.8.x will likely only be to deal with security issues, and
  platform build failures. Hence you should look to migrating to 5.10.x, if you
  have not started already. See &quot;Known Problems&quot; for more information.

<h1 class="Sh" id="Incompatible_Changes"><a class="permalink" href="#Incompatible_Changes">Incompatible
  Changes</a></h1>
A particular construction in the source code of extensions written in C++ may
  need changing. See &quot;Changed Internals&quot; for more details. All
  extensions written in C, most written in C++, and all existing compiled
  extensions are unaffected. This was necessary to improve C++ support.
<p class="Pp">Other than this, there are no changes intentionally incompatible
    with 5.8.8. If any exist, they are bugs and reports are welcome.</p>

  and -X on directory handles</a></h2>
It is now possible to call <span class="Li">&quot;stat&quot;</span> and the
  <span class="Li">&quot;-X&quot;</span> filestat operators on directory
  handles. As both directory and file handles are barewords, there can be
  ambiguities over which was intended. In these situations the file handle
  semantics are preferred. Both also treat <span class="Li">*FILE{IO}</span>
  filehandles like <span class="Li">*FILE</span> filehandles.

<h2 class="Ss" id="Source_filters_in_@INC"><a class="permalink" href="#Source_filters_in_@INC">Source
  filters in @INC</a></h2>
It's possible to enhance the mechanism of subroutine hooks in
  <span class="Li">@INC</span> by adding a source filter on top of the
  filehandle opened and returned by the hook. This feature was planned a long
  time ago, but wasn't quite working until now. See &quot;require&quot; in
  perlfunc for details. (Nicholas Clark)

<h2 class="Ss" id="Exceptions_in_constant_folding"><a class="permalink" href="#Exceptions_in_constant_folding">Exceptions
  in constant folding</a></h2>
The constant folding routine is now wrapped in an exception handler, and if
  folding throws an exception (such as attempting to evaluate 0/0), perl now
  retains the current optree, rather than aborting the whole program. Without
  this change, programs would not compile if they had expressions that happened
  to generate exceptions, even though those expressions were in code that could
  never be reached at runtime. (Nicholas Clark, Dave Mitchell)

You can now use <span class="Li">&quot;no&quot;</span> followed by a version
  number to specify that you want to use a version of perl older than the

  internal UTF-8 caching code</a></h2>
The code that caches calculated UTF-8 byte offsets for character offsets for a
  string has been re-written. Several bugs have been located and eliminated, and
  the code now makes better use of the information it has, so should be faster.
  In particular, it doesn't scan to the end of a string before calculating an
  offset within the string, which should speed up some operations on long
  strings. It is now possible to disable the caching code at run time, to verify
  that it is not the cause of suspected problems.

Perl 5.8.9 (and 5.10.0 onwards) now provides a couple of macros to do very basic
  exception handling in XS modules. You can use these macros if you call code
  that may <span class="Li">&quot;croak&quot;</span>, but you need to do some
  cleanup before giving control back to Perl. See &quot;Exception Handling&quot;
  in perlguts for more details.

<h2 class="Ss" id="Constant_subroutines"><a class="permalink" href="#Constant_subroutines">Constant
  subroutines</a></h2>
The interpreter internals now support a far more memory efficient form of
  inlineable constants. Storing a reference to a constant value in a symbol
  table is equivalent to a full typeglob referencing a constant subroutine, but
  using about 400 bytes less memory. This proxy constant subroutine is
  automatically upgraded to a real typeglob with subroutine if necessary. The
  approach taken is analogous to the existing space optimisation for subroutine
  stub declarations, which are stored as plain scalars in place of the full
  typeglob.
<p class="Pp">However, to aid backwards compatibility of existing code, which
    (wrongly) does not expect anything other than typeglobs in symbol tables,
    nothing in core uses this feature, other than the regression tests.</p>
<p class="Pp">Stubs for prototyped subroutines have been stored in symbol tables
    as plain strings, and stubs for unprototyped subroutines as the number -1,
    since 5.005, so code which assumes that the core only places typeglobs in
    symbol tables has been making incorrect assumptions for over 10 years.</p>

<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>The default since perl 5.000 has been for perl to create an empty scalar
      with every new typeglob. The increased use of lexical variables means that
      most are now unused. Thanks to Nicholas Clark's efforts, Perl can now be
      compiled with <span class="Li">&quot;-DPERL_DONT_CREATE_GVSV&quot;</span>
      to avoid creating these empty scalars. This will significantly decrease
      the number of scalars allocated for all configurations, and the number of
      scalars that need to be copied for ithread creation. Whilst this option is
      binary compatible with existing perl installations, it does change a
      long-standing assumption about the internals, hence it is not enabled by
      default, as some third party code may rely on the old behaviour.
    <p class="Pp">We would recommend testing with this configuration on new
        deployments of perl, particularly for multi-threaded servers, to see
        whether all third party code is compatible with it, as this
        configuration may give useful performance improvements. For existing
        installations we would not recommend changing to this configuration
        unless thorough testing is performed before deployment.</p>

  <li><span class="Li">&quot;diagnostics&quot;</span> no longer uses
      <span class="Li">$&amp;</span>, which results in large speedups for regexp
      matching in all code using it.</li>
  <li>Regular expressions classes of a single character are now treated the same
      as if the character had been used as a literal, meaning that code that
      uses char-classes as an escaping mechanism will see a speedup. (Yves

  <li>Creating anonymous array and hash references (ie.
      <span class="Li">&quot;[]&quot;</span> and

      better than 5% improvement for these operations.</li>
  <li>Many calls to <span class="Li">&quot;strlen()&quot;</span> have been
      eliminated, either because the length was already known, or by adopting or
      enhancing APIs that pass lengths. This has been aided by the adoption of a
      <span class="Li">&quot;my_sprintf()&quot;</span> wrapper, which returns
      the correct C89 value - the length of the formatted string. Previously we
      could not rely on the return value of
      <span class="Li">&quot;sprintf()&quot;</span>, because on some ancient but
      extant platforms it still returns <span class="Li">&quot;char
      *&quot;</span>.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;index&quot;</span> is now faster if the search
      string is stored in UTF-8 but only contains characters in the Latin-1
      range.</li>

There is now <i>Configure</i> support for creating a relocatable perl tree. If
  you <i>Configure</i> with
  <span class="Li">&quot;-Duserelocatableinc&quot;</span>, then the paths in
  <span class="Li">@INC</span> (and everything else in
  <span class="Li">%Config</span>) can be optionally located via the path of the

<p class="Pp">At start time, if any paths in <span class="Li">@INC</span> or

    configured on a per-directory basis, although the default with

Many many bugs related to the internal Unicode implementation (UTF-8) have been

<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;unpack&quot;</span> will internally convert

<h2 class="Ss" id="Reblessing_overloaded_objects_now_works"><a class="permalink" href="#Reblessing_overloaded_objects_now_works">Reblessing
  overloaded objects now works</a></h2>
Internally, perl object-ness is on the referent, not the reference, even though
  methods can only be called via a reference. However, the original
  implementation of overloading stored flags related to overloading on the
  reference, relying on the flags being copied when the reference was copied, or
  set at the creation of a new reference. This manifests in a bug - if you
  rebless an object from a class that has overloading, into one that does not,
  then any other existing references think that they (still) point to an
  overloaded object, choose these C code paths, and then throw errors.
  Analogously, blessing into an overloaded class when other references exist
  will result in them not using overloading.
<p class="Pp">The implementation has been fixed for 5.10, but this fix changes
    the semantics of flag bits, so is not binary compatible, so can't be applied
    to 5.8.9. However, 5.8.9 has a work-around that implements the same bug fix.
    If the referent has multiple references, then all the other references are
    located and corrected. A full search is avoided whenever possible by
    scanning lexicals outwards from the current subroutine, and the argument
    stack.</p>
<p class="Pp">A certain well known Linux vendor applied incomplete versions of
    this bug fix to their <i>/usr/bin/perl</i> and then prematurely closed bug
    reports about performance issues without consulting back upstream. This not
    being enough, they then proceeded to ignore the necessary fixes to these
    unreleased changes for 11 months, until massive pressure was applied by
    their long-suffering paying customers, catalysed by the failings being
    featured on a prominent blog and Slashdot.</p>

      form <span class="Li">&quot;-foo=bar&quot;</span> with the
      <span class="Li">&quot;-s&quot;</span> on the &lt;#!&gt; line. This has
      been fixed. See http://bugs.activestate.com/show_bug.cgi?id=43483</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;tr///&quot;</span> is now threadsafe. Previously it
      was storing a swash inside its OP, rather than in a pad.</li>
  <li><i>pod2html</i> labels anchors more consistently and handles nested
      definition lists better.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;threads&quot;</span> cleanup veto has been extended
      to include <span class="Li">&quot;perl_free()&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;perl_destruct()&quot;</span></li>
  <li>On some systems, changes to <span class="Li">$ENV{TZ}</span> would not
      always be respected by the underlying calls to
      <span class="Li">&quot;localtime_r()&quot;</span>. Perl now forces the
      inspection of the environment on these systems.</li>
  <li>The special variable <span class="Li">$^R</span> is now more consistently
      set when executing regexps using the
      <span class="Li">&quot;(?{...})&quot;</span> construct. In particular, it
      will still be set even if backreferences or optional sub-patterns
      <span class="Li">&quot;(?:...)?&quot;</span> are used.</li>

This new fatal error occurs when the C routine
  <span class="Li">&quot;Perl_sv_chop()&quot;</span> was passed a position that
  is not within the scalar's string buffer. This is caused by buggy XS code, and
  at this point recovery is not possible.

The perl sources can now be compiled with a C++ compiler instead of a C
  compiler. A necessary implementation details is that under C++, the macro
  <span class="Li">&quot;XS&quot;</span> used to define XSUBs now includes an
  <span class="Li">&quot;extern &quot;C&quot;&quot;</span> definition. A side
  effect of this is that <b>C++</b> code that used the construction
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    typedef XS(SwigPerlWrapper);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">now needs to be written</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    typedef XSPROTO(SwigPerlWrapper);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">using the new <span class="Li">&quot;XSPROTO&quot;</span> macro,
    in order to compile. C extensions are unaffected, although C extensions are
    encouraged to use <span class="Li">&quot;XSPROTO&quot;</span> too. This
    change was present in the 5.10.0 release of perl, so any actively maintained
    code that happened to use this construction should already have been
    adapted. Code that needs changing will fail with a compilation error.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;set&quot;</span> magic on
    localizing/assigning to a magic variable will now only trigger for
    <i>container magics</i>, i.e. it will for <span class="Li">%ENV</span> or
    <span class="Li">%SIG</span> but not for
  <span class="Li">$#array</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The new API macro <span class="Li">&quot;newSVpvs()&quot;</span>
    can be used in place of constructions such as
    <span class="Li">&quot;newSVpvn(&quot;ISA&quot;, 3)&quot;</span>. It takes a
    single string constant, and at C compile time determines its length.</p>
<p class="Pp">The new API function
    <span class="Li">&quot;Perl_newSV_type()&quot;</span> can be used as a more
    efficient replacement of the common idiom</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    sv = newSV(0);
    sv_upgrade(sv, type);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Similarly
    <span class="Li">&quot;Perl_newSVpvn_flags()&quot;</span> can be used to
    combine <span class="Li">&quot;Perl_newSVpv()&quot;</span> with
    <span class="Li">&quot;Perl_sv_2mortal()&quot;</span> or the equivalent
    <span class="Li">&quot;Perl_sv_newmortal()&quot;</span> with
    <span class="Li">&quot;Perl_sv_setpvn()&quot;</span></p>
<p class="Pp">Two new macros <span class="Li">&quot;mPUSHs()&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;mXPUSHs()&quot;</span> are added, to make it easier
    to push mortal SVs onto the stack. They were then used to fix several bugs
    where values on the stack had not been mortalised.</p>
<p class="Pp">A <span class="Li">&quot;Perl_signbit()&quot;</span> function was
    added to test the sign of an <span class="Li">&quot;NV&quot;</span>. It maps
    to the system one when available.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;Perl_av_reify()&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;Perl_lex_end()&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;Perl_mod()&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;Perl_op_clear()&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;Perl_pop_return()&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;Perl_qerror()&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;Perl_setdefout()&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;Perl_vivify_defelem()&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;Perl_yylex()&quot;</span> are now visible to
    extensions. This was required to allow
    <span class="Li">&quot;Data::Alias&quot;</span> to work on Windows.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;Perl_find_runcv()&quot;</span> is now
    visible to perl core extensions. This was required to allow
    <span class="Li">&quot;Sub::Current&quot;</span> to work on Windows.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;ptr_table*&quot;</span> functions are now
    available in unthreaded perl. <span class="Li">&quot;Storable&quot;</span>
    takes advantage of this.</p>
<p class="Pp">There have been many small cleanups made to the internals. In
    particular, <span class="Li">&quot;Perl_sv_upgrade()&quot;</span> has been
    simplified considerably, with a straight-through code path that uses
    <span class="Li">&quot;memset()&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;memcpy()&quot;</span> to initialise the new body,
    rather than assignment via multiple temporary variables. It has also
    benefited from simplification and de-duplication of the arena management
    code.</p>
<p class="Pp">A lot of small improvements in the code base were made due to
    reports from the Coverity static code analyzer.</p>
<p class="Pp">Corrected use and documentation of
    <span class="Li">&quot;Perl_gv_stashpv()&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;Perl_gv_stashpvn()&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;Perl_gv_stashsv()&quot;</span> functions (last
    parameter is a bitmask, not boolean).</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;PERL_SYS_INIT&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;PERL_SYS_INIT3&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;PERL_SYS_TERM&quot;</span> macros have been changed
    into functions.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;PERLSYS_TERM&quot;</span> no longer
    requires a context. <span class="Li">&quot;PerlIO_teardown()&quot;</span> is
    now called without a context, and debugging output in this function has been
    disabled because that required that an interpreter was present, an invalid
    assumption at termination time.</p>
<p class="Pp">All compile time options which affect binary compatibility have
    been grouped together into a global variable
    (<span class="Li">&quot;PL_bincompat_options&quot;</span>).</p>
<p class="Pp">The values of <span class="Li">&quot;PERL_REVISION&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;PERL_VERSION&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;PERL_SUBVERSION&quot;</span> are now baked into
    global variables (and hence into any shared perl library). Additionally
    under <span class="Li">&quot;MULTIPLICITY&quot;</span>, the perl executable
    now records the size of the interpreter structure (total, and for this
    version). Coupled with
    <span class="Li">&quot;PL_bincompat_options&quot;</span> this will allow
    5.8.10 (and later), when compiled with a shared perl library, to perform
    sanity checks in <span class="Li">&quot;main()&quot;</span> to verify that
    the shared library is indeed binary compatible.</p>
<p class="Pp">Symbolic references can now have embedded NULs. The new public
    function <span class="Li">&quot;Perl_get_cvn_flags()&quot;</span> can be
    used in extensions if you have to handle them.</p>

There are no known new bugs.
<p class="Pp">However, programs that rely on bugs that have been fixed will have
    problems. Also, many bug fixes present in 5.10.0 can't be back-ported to the
    5.8.x branch, because they require changes that are binary incompatible, or
    because the code changes are too large and hence too risky to
  incorporate.</p>
<p class="Pp">We have only limited volunteer labour, and the maintenance burden
    is getting increasingly complex. Hence this will be the last significant
    release of the 5.8.x series. Any future releases of 5.8.x will likely only
    be to deal with security issues, and platform build failures. Hence you
    should look to migrating to 5.10.x, if you have not started already.
    Alternatively, if business requirements constrain you to continue to use
    5.8.x, you may wish to consider commercial support from firms such as
    ActiveState.</p>

Some of the work in this release was funded by a TPF grant.
<p class="Pp">Steve Hay worked behind the scenes working out the causes of the
    differences between core modules, their CPAN releases, and previous core
    releases, and the best way to rectify them. He doesn't want to do it again.
    I know this feeling, and I'm very glad he did it this time, instead of
  me.</p>
<p class="Pp">Paul Fenwick assembled a team of 18 volunteers, who broke the back
    of writing this document. In particular, Bradley Dean, Eddy Tan, and Vincent
    Pit provided half the team's contribution.</p>
<p class="Pp">Schwern verified the list of updated module versions, correcting
    quite a few errors that I (and everyone else) had missed, both wrongly
    stated module versions, and changed modules that had not been listed.</p>
<p class="Pp">The crack Berlin-based QA team of Andreas Koenig and Slaven Rezic
    tirelessly re-built snapshots, tested most everything CPAN against them, and
    then identified the changes responsible for any module regressions, ensuring
    that several show-stopper bugs were stomped before the first release
    candidate was cut.</p>
<p class="Pp">The other core committers contributed most of the changes, and
    applied most of the patches sent in by the hundreds of contributors listed
    in <i>AUTHORS</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">And obviously, Larry Wall, without whom we wouldn't have Perl.</p>
