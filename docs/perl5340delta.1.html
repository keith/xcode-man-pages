  freely allowed within but adjacent to curly braces</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">(in double-quotish contexts and regular expression patterns)</p>
<p class="Pp">This means you can write things like
    <span class="Li">&quot;\x{&#x00A0;FFFC&#x00A0;}&quot;</span> if you like.
    This applies to all such constructs, namely
    <span class="Li">&quot;\b{}&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;\g{}&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;\k{}&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;\N{}&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;\o{}&quot;</span>, and

    quantifier
    <span class="Li">&quot;{</span><span class="Li"><i>m</i></span><span class="Li">,</span><span class="Li"><i>n</i></span><span class="Li">}&quot;</span>.
    <span class="Li">&quot;\p{}&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;\P{}&quot;</span> retain their already-existing, even
    looser, rules mandated by the Unicode standard (see &quot;Properties
    accessible through \p{} and \P{}&quot; in perluniprops).</p>
<p class="Pp">This ability is in effect regardless of the presence of the
    <span class="Li">&quot;/x&quot;</span> regular expression pattern
  modifier.</p>
<p class="Pp">Additionally, the comma in a regular expression braced quantifier
    may have blanks (tabs or spaces) before and/or after the comma, like
    <span class="Li">&quot;qr/a{&#x00A0;5,&#x00A0;7&#x00A0;}/&quot;</span>.</p>

    <span class="Li">&quot;0o123_456&quot;</span>, parallel to the existing

    and binary literal
    <span class="Li">&quot;0b</span><span class="Li"><i>ddddd</i></span><span class="Li">&quot;</span>.

    <p class="Pp">This applies to

        <span class="Li">&quot;croak()&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;warn()&quot;</span>,

    <p class="Pp">Previously in <span class="Li">&quot;quadmath&quot;</span>

    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>  PerlIO_printf(PerlIO_stderr(), &quot;%g&quot;, somedouble);

    <p class="Pp">or</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>  PerlIO_printf(PerlIO_stderr(), &quot;%Lg&quot;, somelongdouble);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">would erroneously throw an exception &quot;panic: quadmath
        invalid format ...&quot;, since the code added for quadmath builds
        assumed <span class="Li">&quot;NV&quot;</span>s were the only floating
        point format passed into these functions.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This code would also process the standard C long double
        specifier <span class="Li">&quot;L&quot;</span> as if it expected an
        <span class="Li">&quot;NV&quot;</span>
        (<span class="Li">&quot;__float128&quot;</span> for quadmath builds),
        resulting in undefined behaviour.</p>
    <p class="Pp">These functions now correctly accept doubles, long doubles and
        NVs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Previously the right operand of bitwise shift operators (shift amount) was
      implicitly cast from IV to int, but it might lead wrong results if IV does
      not fit in int.
    <p class="Pp">And also, shifting INT_MIN bits used to yield the shiftee
        unchanged (treated as 0-bit shift instead of negative shift).</p>
  </li>
  <li>A set of
      <span class="Li">&quot;cop_hints_exists_{pv,pvn,pvs,sv}&quot;</span>
      functions was added, to support checking for the existence of keys in the
      hints hash of a specific cop without needing to create a mortal copy of
      said value.</li>
  <li>An aid has been added for using the
      <span class="Li">&quot;DEBUG&quot;</span> macros when debugging XS or C
      code. The comments in <i>perl.h</i> describe
      <span class="Li">&quot;DEBUG_PRE_STMTS&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;DEBUG_POST_STMTS&quot;</span>. which you can
      <span class="Li">&quot;#define&quot;</span> to do things like save and
      restore <span class="Li">&quot;errno&quot;</span>, in case the
      <span class="Li">&quot;DEBUG&quot;</span> calls are interfering with that,
      or to display timestamps, or which thread it's coming from, or the
      location of the call, or whatever. You can make a quick hack to help you
      track something down without having to edit individual
      <span class="Li">&quot;DEBUG&quot;</span> calls.</li>
  <li>Make <span class="Li">&quot;REFCOUNTED_HE_EXISTS&quot;</span> available
      outside of core</li>
  <li>All <span class="Li">&quot;SvTRUE&quot;</span>-ish functions now evaluate
      their arguments exactly once. In 5.32, plain
      &quot;<span class="Li">&quot;SvTRUE&quot;</span>&quot; in perlapi was
      changed to do that; now the rest do as well.</li>
  <li>Unicode is now a first class citizen when considering the pattern /A*B/
      where A and B are arbitrary. The pattern matching code tries to make a
      tight loop to match the span of A's. The logic of this was now really
      updated with support for UTF-8.</li>
  <li>The re module has a new function
      <span class="Li">&quot;optimization&quot;</span>, which can return a
      hashref of optimization data discovered about a compiled regexp.</li>
  <li>The <span class="Li">&quot;PERL_GLOBAL_STRUCT&quot;</span> compilation
      option has been removed, and with it the need or the
      <span class="Li">&quot;dVAR&quot;</span> macro.
      <span class="Li">&quot;dVAR&quot;</span> remains defined as a no-op
      outside <span class="Li">&quot;PERL_CORE&quot;</span> for backwards
      compatiblity with XS modules.</li>
  <li>A new savestack type <span class="Li">&quot;SAVEt_HINTS_HH&quot;</span>
      has been added, which neatens the previous behaviour of
      <span class="Li">&quot;SAVEt_HINTS&quot;</span>. On previous versions the
      types and values pushed to the save stack would depend on whether the
      hints included the <span class="Li">&quot;HINT_LOCALIZE_HH&quot;</span>
      bit, which complicates external code that inspects the save stack. The new
      version uses a different savestack type to indicate the difference.</li>
  <li>A new API function &quot;av_count&quot; in perlapi has been added which
      gives a clearly named way to find how many elements are in an array.</li>

  <li>Fix a memory leak in regcomp.c [GH #18604
      &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/18604&gt;]</li>
  <li>pack/unpack format 'D' now works on all systems that could support it
    <p class="Pp">Previously if <span class="Li">&quot;NV == long
        double&quot;</span>, now it is supported on all platforms that have long
        doubles. In particular that means it is now also supported on quadmath
        platforms.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Skip trying to constant fold an incomplete op tree [GH #18380
      &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/18380&gt;]
    <p class="Pp">Constant folding of chained comparison op trees could fail
        under certain conditions, causing perl to crash. As a quick fix,
        constant folding is now skipped for such op trees. This also addresses
        [GH #17917 &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/17917&gt;].</p>
  </li>
  <li><span class="Li">%g</span> formatting broken on Ubuntu-18.04,
      <span class="Li">&quot;NVSIZE == 8&quot;</span> [GH #18170
      &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/18170&gt;]
    <p class="Pp">Buggy libc implementations of the
        <span class="Li">&quot;gcvt&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;qgcvt&quot;</span> functions caused
        <span class="Li">&quot;(s)printf&quot;</span> to incorrectly truncate
        <span class="Li">%g</span> formatted numbers. A new Configure probe now
        checks for this, with the result that the libc
        <span class="Li">&quot;sprintf&quot;</span> will be used in place of
        <span class="Li">&quot;gcvt&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;qgcvt&quot;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Tests added as part of this fix also revealed related problems
        in some Windows builds. The makefiles for MINGW builds on Windows have
        thus been adjusted to use
        <span class="Li">&quot;USE_MINGW_ANSI_STDIO&quot;</span> by default,
        ensuring that they also provide correct
        <span class="Li">&quot;(s)printf&quot;</span> formatting of numbers.</p>
  </li>
  <li><i>op.c</i>: croak on <span class="Li">&quot;my $_&quot;</span> when
      <span class="Li">&quot;use utf8&quot;</span> is in effect [GH #18449
      &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/18449&gt;]
    <p class="Pp">The lexical topic feature experiment was removed in Perl v5.24
        and declaring <span class="Li">&quot;my $_&quot;</span> became a compile
        time error. However, it was previously still possible to make this
        declaration if <span class="Li">&quot;use utf8&quot;</span> was in
        effect.</p>
  </li>
  <li><i>regexec.c</i>: Fix assertion failure [GH #18451
      &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/18451&gt;]
    <p class="Pp">Fuzzing triggered an assertion failure in the regexp engine
        when too many characters were copied into a buffer.</p>
  </li>
  <li><b>semctl()</b>, <b>msgctl()</b>, and <b>shmctl()</b> now properly reset
      the UTF-8 flag on the <span class="Li">&quot;ARG&quot;</span> parameter if
      it's modified for <span class="Li">&quot;IPC_STAT&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;GETALL&quot;</span> operations.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;semctl()&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;msgctl()&quot;</span>, and
      <span class="Li">&quot;shmctl()&quot;</span> now attempt to downgrade the
      <span class="Li">&quot;ARG&quot;</span> parameter if its value is being
      used as input to <span class="Li">&quot;IPC_SET&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;SETALL&quot;</span> calls. A failed downgrade will
      thrown an exception.</li>
  <li>In cases where <span class="Li">&quot;semctl()&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;msgctl()&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;shmctl()&quot;</span> would treat the
      <span class="Li">&quot;ARG&quot;</span> parameter as a pointer, an
      undefined value no longer generates a warning. In most such calls the
      pointer isn't used anyway and this allows you to supply
      <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> for a value not used by the
      underlying function.</li>
  <li><b>semop()</b> now downgrades the
      <span class="Li">&quot;OPSTRING&quot;</span> parameter, <b>msgsnd()</b>
      now downgrades the <span class="Li">&quot;MSG&quot;</span> parameter and
      shmwrite now downgrades the <span class="Li">&quot;STRING&quot;</span>
      parameter to treat them as bytes. Previously they would be left upgraded,
      providing a corrupted structure to the underlying function call.</li>
  <li><b>msgrcv()</b> now properly resets the UTF-8 flag the
      <span class="Li">&quot;VAR&quot;</span> parameter when it is modified.
      Previously the UTF-8 flag could be left on, resulting in a possibly
      corrupt result in <span class="Li">&quot;VAR&quot;</span>.</li>
  <li>Magic is now called correctly for stacked file test operators. [GH #18293
      &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/18293&gt;]</li>
  <li>The <span class="Li">&quot;@ary = split(...)&quot;</span> optimization no
      longer switches in the target array as the value stack. [GH #18232
      &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/18232&gt;] Also see discussion at
      &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/pull/18014#issuecomment-671299506&gt;.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug in which some regexps with recursive subpatterns matched
      incorrectly.
    <p class="Pp">[GH #18096
      &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/18096&gt;]</p>
  </li>
  <li>On Win32, <span class="Li">&quot;waitpid(-1, WNOHANG)&quot;</span> could
      sometimes have a very large timeout. [GH #16529
      &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16529&gt;]</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;MARK&quot;</span> and hence
      <span class="Li">&quot;items&quot;</span> are now correctly initialized in
      <span class="Li">&quot;BOOT&quot;</span> XSUBs.</li>
  <li>Some list assignments involving <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span>
      on the left-hand side were over-optimized and produced incorrect results.
      [GH #16685 &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16685&gt;], [GH #17816
