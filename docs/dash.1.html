<code class="Nm">dash</code> is the standard command interpreter for the system.
  The current version of <code class="Nm">dash</code> is in the process of being
  changed to conform with the POSIX 1003.2 and 1003.2a specifications for the
  shell. This version has many features which make it appear similar in some
  respects to the Korn shell, but it is not a Korn shell clone (see
  <a class="Xr">ksh(1)</a>). Only features designated by POSIX, plus a few
  Berkeley extensions, are being incorporated into this shell. This man page is
  not intended to be a tutorial or a complete specification of the shell.
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Overview"><a class="permalink" href="#Overview">Overview</a></h2>
The shell is a command that reads lines from either a file or the terminal,
  interprets them, and generally executes other commands. It is the program that
  is running when a user logs into the system (although a user can select a
  different shell with the <a class="Xr">chsh(1)</a> command). The shell
  implements a language that has flow control constructs, a macro facility that
  provides a variety of features in addition to data storage, along with built
  in history and line editing capabilities. It incorporates many features to aid
  interactive use and has the advantage that the interpretative language is
  common to both interactive and non-interactive use (shell scripts). That is,
  commands can be typed directly to the running shell or can be put into a file
  and the file can be executed directly by the shell.
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Invocation"><a class="permalink" href="#Invocation">Invocation</a></h2>
If no args are present and if the standard input of the shell is connected to a
  terminal (or if the <code class="Fl">-i</code> flag is set), and the
  <code class="Fl">-c</code> option is not present, the shell is considered an
  interactive shell. An interactive shell generally prompts before each command
  and handles programming and command errors differently (as described below).
  When first starting, the shell inspects argument 0, and if it begins with a
  dash &#x2018;-&#x2019;, the shell is also considered a login shell. This is
  normally done automatically by the system when the user first logs in. A login
  shell first reads commands from the files <span class="Pa">/etc/profile</span>
  and <span class="Pa">.profile</span> if they exist. If the environment
  variable <code class="Ev">ENV</code> is set on entry to an interactive shell,
  or is set in the <span class="Pa">.profile</span> of a login shell, the shell
  next reads commands from the file named in <code class="Ev">ENV</code>.
  Therefore, a user should place commands that are to be executed only at login
  time in the <span class="Pa">.profile</span> file, and commands that are
  executed for every interactive shell inside the <code class="Ev">ENV</code>
  file. To set the <code class="Ev">ENV</code> variable to some file, place the
  following line in your <span class="Pa">.profile</span> of your home directory
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd Bd-indent"><code class="Li">ENV=$HOME/.shinit; export
  ENV</code></div>
<p class="Pp">substituting for &#x201C;.shinit&#x201D; any filename you
  wish.</p>
<p class="Pp">If command line arguments besides the options have been specified,
    then the shell treats the first argument as the name of a file from which to
    read commands (a shell script), and the remaining arguments are set as the
    positional parameters of the shell ($1, $2, etc). Otherwise, the shell reads
    commands from its standard input.</p>

All of the single letter options that have a corresponding name can be used as
  an argument to the <code class="Fl">-o</code> option. The set
  <code class="Fl">-o</code> name is provided next to the single letter option
  in the description below. Specifying a dash &#x201C;-&#x201D; turns the option
  on, while using a plus &#x201C;+&#x201D; disables the option. The following
  options can be set from the command line or with the
  <code class="Ic">set</code> builtin (described later).

<h2 class="Ss" id="Lexical_Structure"><a class="permalink" href="#Lexical_Structure">Lexical
  Structure</a></h2>
The shell reads input in terms of lines from a file and breaks it up into words
  at whitespace (blanks and tabs), and at certain sequences of characters that
  are special to the shell called &#x201C;operators&#x201D;. There are two types
  of operators: control operators and redirection operators (their meaning is
  discussed later). Following is a list of operators:
<dl class="Bl-ohang Bd-indent">
  <dt>Control operators:</dt>
  <dd>
    <div class="Bd Bd-indent"><code class="Li">&amp; &amp;&amp; ( ) ; ;; | ||
      &lt;newline&gt;</code></div>
  </dd>
  <dt>Redirection operators:</dt>
  <dd>
    <div class="Bd Bd-indent"><code class="Li">&lt; &gt; &gt;| &lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;

  </dd>
</dl>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Quoting"><a class="permalink" href="#Quoting">Quoting</a></h2>
Quoting is used to remove the special meaning of certain characters or words to
  the shell, such as operators, whitespace, or keywords. There are three types
  of quoting: matched single quotes, matched double quotes, and backslash.
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Backslash"><a class="permalink" href="#Backslash">Backslash</a></h2>
A backslash preserves the literal meaning of the following character, with the
  exception of &#x27E8;newline&#x27E9;. A backslash preceding a
  &#x27E8;newline&#x27E9; is treated as a line continuation.
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Single_Quotes"><a class="permalink" href="#Single_Quotes">Single
  Quotes</a></h2>
Enclosing characters in single quotes preserves the literal meaning of all the
  characters (except single quotes, making it impossible to put single-quotes in
  a single-quoted string).
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Double_Quotes"><a class="permalink" href="#Double_Quotes">Double
  Quotes</a></h2>
Enclosing characters within double quotes preserves the literal meaning of all
  characters except dollarsign ($), backquote (`), and backslash (\). The
  backslash inside double quotes is historically weird, and serves to quote only
  the following characters:
<div class="Bd Bd-indent"><code class="Li">$ ` &quot; \
  &lt;newline&gt;.</code></div>
Otherwise it remains literal.
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Reserved_Words"><a class="permalink" href="#Reserved_Words">Reserved
  Words</a></h2>
Reserved words are words that have special meaning to the shell and are
  recognized at the beginning of a line and after a control operator. The
  following are reserved words:
<table class="Bl-column Bd-indent">
  <tr>
    <td>!</td>
    <td>elif</td>
    <td>fi</td>
    <td>while</td>
    <td>case</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>else</td>
    <td>for</td>
    <td>then</td>
    <td>{</td>
    <td>}</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>do</td>
    <td>done</td>
    <td>until</td>
    <td>if</td>
    <td>esac</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p class="Pp">Their meaning is discussed later.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Aliases"><a class="permalink" href="#Aliases">Aliases</a></h2>
An alias is a name and corresponding value set using the
  <a class="Xr">alias(1)</a> builtin command. Whenever a reserved word may occur
  (see above), and after checking for reserved words, the shell checks the word
  to see if it matches an alias. If it does, it replaces it in the input stream
  with its value. For example, if there is an alias called &#x201C;lf&#x201D;
  with the value &#x201C;ls -F&#x201D;, then the input:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd Bd-indent"><code class="Li">lf foobar
  &#x27E8;return&#x27E9;</code></div>
<p class="Pp">would become</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd Bd-indent"><code class="Li">ls -F foobar
  &#x27E8;return&#x27E9;</code></div>
<p class="Pp">Aliases provide a convenient way for naive users to create
    shorthands for commands without having to learn how to create functions with
    arguments. They can also be used to create lexically obscure code. This use
    is discouraged.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Commands"><a class="permalink" href="#Commands">Commands</a></h2>
The shell interprets the words it reads according to a language, the
  specification of which is outside the scope of this man page (refer to the BNF
  in the POSIX 1003.2 document). Essentially though, a line is read and if the
  first word of the line (or after a control operator) is not a reserved word,
  then the shell has recognized a simple command. Otherwise, a complex command
  or some other special construct may have been recognized.
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Simple_Commands"><a class="permalink" href="#Simple_Commands">Simple
  Commands</a></h2>
If a simple command has been recognized, the shell performs the following
  actions:
<ol class="Bl-enum Bd-indent">
  <li>Leading words of the form &#x201C;name=value&#x201D; are stripped off and
      assigned to the environment of the simple command. Redirection operators
      and their arguments (as described below) are stripped off and saved for
      processing.</li>
  <li>The remaining words are expanded as described in the section called
      &#x201C;Expansions&#x201D;, and the first remaining word is considered the
      command name and the command is located. The remaining words are
      considered the arguments of the command. If no command name resulted, then
      the &#x201C;name=value&#x201D; variable assignments recognized in item 1
      affect the current shell.</li>
  <li>Redirections are performed as described in the next section.</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Redirections"><a class="permalink" href="#Redirections">Redirections</a></h2>
Redirections are used to change where a command reads its input or sends its
  output. In general, redirections open, close, or duplicate an existing
  reference to a file. The overall format used for redirection is:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd Bd-indent"><code class="Li">[n] <var class="Va">redir-op</var>
  <var class="Ar">file</var></code></div>
<p class="Pp">where <var class="Va">redir-op</var> is one of the redirection
    operators mentioned previously. Following is a list of the possible
    redirections. The [n] is an optional number between 0 and 9, as in
    &#x2018;3&#x2019; (not &#x2018;[3]&#x2019;), that refers to a file
    descriptor.</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>[n]&gt; file</dt>
  <dd>Redirect standard output (or n) to file.</dd>

</ul>
<p class="Pp">All the text on successive lines up to the delimiter is saved away
    and made available to the command on standard input, or file descriptor n if
    it is specified. If the delimiter as specified on the initial line is
    quoted, then the here-doc-text is treated literally, otherwise the text is
    subjected to parameter expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic
    expansion (as described in the section on &#x201C;Expansions&#x201D;). If
    the operator is &#x201C;&lt;&lt;-&#x201D; instead of
    &#x201C;&lt;&lt;&#x201D;, then leading tabs in the here-doc-text are
    stripped.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Search_and_Execution"><a class="permalink" href="#Search_and_Execution">Search
  and Execution</a></h2>
There are three types of commands: shell functions, builtin commands, and normal
  programs -- and the command is searched for (by name) in that order. They each
  are executed in a different way.
<p class="Pp">When a shell function is executed, all of the shell positional
    parameters (except $0, which remains unchanged) are set to the arguments of
    the shell function. The variables which are explicitly placed in the
    environment of the command (by placing assignments to them before the
    function name) are made local to the function and are set to the values
    given. Then the command given in the function definition is executed. The
    positional parameters are restored to their original values when the command
    completes. This all occurs within the current shell.</p>
<p class="Pp">Shell builtins are executed internally to the shell, without
    spawning a new process.</p>
<p class="Pp">Otherwise, if the command name doesn't match a function or
    builtin, the command is searched for as a normal program in the file system
    (as described in the next section). When a normal program is executed, the
    shell runs the program, passing the arguments and the environment to the
    program. If the program is not a normal executable file (i.e., if it does
    not begin with the &quot;magic number&quot; whose ASCII representation is
    &quot;#!&quot;, so <a class="Xr">execve(2)</a> returns
    <code class="Er">ENOEXEC</code> then) the shell will interpret the program
    in a subshell. The child shell will reinitialize itself in this case, so
    that the effect will be as if a new shell had been invoked to handle the
    ad-hoc shell script, except that the location of hashed commands located in
    the parent shell will be remembered by the child.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that previous versions of this document and the source code
    itself misleadingly and sporadically refer to a shell script without a magic
    number as a &quot;shell procedure&quot;.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Path_Search"><a class="permalink" href="#Path_Search">Path
  Search</a></h2>
When locating a command, the shell first looks to see if it has a shell function
  by that name. Then it looks for a builtin command by that name. If a builtin
  command is not found, one of two things happen:
<ol class="Bl-enum">
  <li>Command names containing a slash are simply executed without performing
      any searches.</li>
  <li>The shell searches each entry in <code class="Ev">PATH</code> in turn for
      the command. The value of the <code class="Ev">PATH</code> variable should
      be a series of entries separated by colons. Each entry consists of a
      directory name. The current directory may be indicated implicitly by an
      empty directory name, or explicitly by a single period.</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Command_Exit_Status"><a class="permalink" href="#Command_Exit_Status">Command
  Exit Status</a></h2>
Each command has an exit status that can influence the behaviour of other shell
  commands. The paradigm is that a command exits with zero for normal or
  success, and non-zero for failure, error, or a false indication. The man page
  for each command should indicate the various exit codes and what they mean.
  Additionally, the builtin commands return exit codes, as does an executed
  shell function.
<p class="Pp">If a command consists entirely of variable assignments then the
    exit status of the command is that of the last command substitution if any,
    otherwise 0.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Complex_Commands"><a class="permalink" href="#Complex_Commands">Complex
  Commands</a></h2>
Complex commands are combinations of simple commands with control operators or
  reserved words, together creating a larger complex command. More generally, a
  command is one of the following:
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>simple command</li>
  <li>pipeline</li>
  <li>list or compound-list</li>
  <li>compound command</li>
  <li>function definition</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">Unless otherwise stated, the exit status of a command is that of
    the last simple command executed by the command.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Pipelines"><a class="permalink" href="#Pipelines">Pipelines</a></h2>
A pipeline is a sequence of one or more commands separated by the control
  operator |. The standard output of all but the last command is connected to
  the standard input of the next command. The standard output of the last
  command is inherited from the shell, as usual.
<p class="Pp">The format for a pipeline is:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd Bd-indent"><code class="Li">[!] command1 [| command2
  ...]</code></div>
<p class="Pp">The standard output of command1 is connected to the standard input
    of command2. The standard input, standard output, or both of a command is
    considered to be assigned by the pipeline before any redirection specified
    by redirection operators that are part of the command.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the pipeline is not in the background (discussed later), the
    shell waits for all commands to complete.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the reserved word ! does not precede the pipeline, the exit
    status is the exit status of the last command specified in the pipeline.
    Otherwise, the exit status is the logical NOT of the exit status of the last
    command. That is, if the last command returns zero, the exit status is 1; if
    the last command returns greater than zero, the exit status is zero.</p>
<p class="Pp">Because pipeline assignment of standard input or standard output
    or both takes place before redirection, it can be modified by redirection.
    For example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd Bd-indent"><code class="Li">$ command1 2&gt;&amp;1 |
  command2</code></div>
<p class="Pp">sends both the standard output and standard error of command1 to
    the standard input of command2.</p>
<p class="Pp">A ; or &#x27E8;newline&#x27E9; terminator causes the preceding
    AND-OR-list (described next) to be executed sequentially; a &amp; causes
    asynchronous execution of the preceding AND-OR-list.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that unlike some other shells, each process in the pipeline
    is a child of the invoking shell (unless it is a shell builtin, in which
    case it executes in the current shell -- but any effect it has on the
    environment is wiped).</p>

If a command is terminated by the control operator ampersand (&amp;), the shell
  executes the command asynchronously -- that is, the shell does not wait for
  the command to finish before executing the next command.
<p class="Pp">The format for running a command in background is:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd Bd-indent"><code class="Li">command1 &amp; [command2 &amp;

A list is a sequence of zero or more commands separated by newlines, semicolons,
  or ampersands, and optionally terminated by one of these three characters. The
  commands in a list are executed in the order they are written. If command is
  followed by an ampersand, the shell starts the command and immediately
  proceeds onto the next command; otherwise it waits for the command to
  terminate before proceeding to the next one.

<p class="Pp">The parameter name or symbol can be enclosed in braces, which are

Unless the <code class="Fl">-f</code> flag is set, file name generation is

  with the names of all existing files whose names can be formed by replacing
  each pattern with a string that matches the specified pattern. There are two
  restrictions on this: first, a pattern cannot match a string containing a
  slash, and second, a pattern cannot match a string starting with a period

  &#x201C;?&#x201D;, and &#x201C;[&#x201D;. These characters lose their special
  meanings if they are quoted. When command or variable substitution is
  performed and the dollar sign or back quotes are not double quoted, the value
  of the variable or the output of the command is scanned for these characters
  and they are turned into meta-characters.
<p class="Pp">An asterisk (&#x201C;*&#x201D;) matches any string of characters.
    A question mark matches any single character. A left bracket
    (&#x201C;[&#x201D;) introduces a character class. The end of the character
    class is indicated by a (&#x201C;]&#x201D;); if the &#x201C;]&#x201D; is
    missing then the &#x201C;[&#x201D; matches a &#x201C;[&#x201D; rather than
    introducing a character class. A character class matches any of the
    characters between the square brackets. A range of characters may be
    specified using a minus sign. The character class may be complemented by
    making an exclamation point the first character of the character class.</p>
<p class="Pp">To include a &#x201C;]&#x201D; in a character class, make it the

  Line Editing</a></h2>
When <code class="Nm">dash</code> is being used interactively from a terminal,
  the current command and the command history (see <code class="Ic">fc</code> in
  <a class="Sx" href="#Builtins">Builtins</a>) can be edited using vi-mode
  command-line editing. This mode uses commands, described below, similar to a
  subset of those described in the vi man page. The command
  &#x2018;<code class="Li">set -o vi</code>&#x2019; enables vi-mode editing and
  places sh into vi insert mode. With vi-mode enabled, sh can be switched
  between insert mode and command mode. It is similar to vi: typing
  &#x27E8;ESC&#x27E9; enters vi command mode. Hitting &#x27E8;return&#x27E9;
  while in command mode will pass the line to the shell.

Errors that are detected by the shell, such as a syntax error, will cause the
  shell to exit with a non-zero exit status. If the shell is not an interactive
  shell, the execution of the shell file will be aborted. Otherwise the shell
  will return the exit status of the last command executed, or if the exit
  builtin is used with a numeric argument, it will return the argument.
