<p class="Pp">A <code class="Nm">crontab</code> file contains instructions to
    the <a class="Xr">cron(8)</a> daemon of the general form: ``run this command
    at this time on this date''. Each user has their own crontab, and commands
    in any given crontab will be executed as the user who owns the crontab. Uucp
    and News will usually have their own crontabs, eliminating the need for
    explicitly running <a class="Xr">su(1)</a> as part of a cron command.</p>
<p class="Pp">(Darwin note: Although <a class="Xr">cron(8)</a> and
    <a class="Xr">crontab(5)</a> are officially supported under Darwin, their
    functionality has been absorbed into <a class="Xr">launchd(8)</a>, which
    provides a more flexible way of automatically executing commands. See
    <a class="Xr">launchd.plist(5)</a> for more information.)</p>
<p class="Pp">Blank lines and leading spaces and tabs are ignored. Lines whose
    first non-space character is a pound-sign (#) are comments, and are ignored.
    Note that comments are not allowed on the same line as cron commands, since
    they will be taken to be part of the command. Similarly, comments are not
    allowed on the same line as environment variable settings.</p>
<p class="Pp">An active line in a crontab will be either an environment setting
    or a cron command. An environment setting is of the form,</p>
<div class="Bd Pp Li">
<pre>    name = value</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">where the spaces around the equal-sign (=) are optional, and any
    subsequent non-leading spaces in <i class="Em">value</i> will be part of the
    value assigned to <i class="Em">name</i>. The <i class="Em">value</i> string
    may be placed in quotes (single or double, but matching) to preserve leading
    or trailing blanks. The <i class="Em">name</i> string may also be placed in
    quote (single or double, but matching) to preserve leading, trailing or
    inner blanks.</p>
<p class="Pp">Several environment variables are set up automatically by the
    <a class="Xr">cron(8)</a> daemon. <code class="Ev">SHELL</code> is set to
    <span class="Pa">/bin/sh</span>, and <code class="Ev">LOGNAME</code> and
    <code class="Ev">HOME</code> are set from the
    <span class="Pa">/etc/passwd</span> line of the crontab's owner.
    <code class="Ev">HOME</code> and <code class="Ev">SHELL</code> may be
    overridden by settings in the crontab; <code class="Ev">LOGNAME</code> may
    not.</p>
<p class="Pp">(Another note: the <code class="Ev">LOGNAME</code> variable is
    sometimes called <code class="Ev">USER</code> on <span class="Ux">BSD</span>
    systems... On these systems, <code class="Ev">USER</code> will be set
  also).</p>
<p class="Pp">In addition to <code class="Ev">LOGNAME</code>,
    <code class="Ev">HOME</code>, and <code class="Ev">SHELL</code>,
    <a class="Xr">cron(8)</a> will look at <code class="Ev">MAILTO</code> if it
    has any reason to send mail as a result of running commands in ``this''
    crontab. If <code class="Ev">MAILTO</code> is defined (and non-empty), mail
    is sent to the user so named. If <code class="Ev">MAILTO</code> is defined
    but empty (MAILTO=&quot;&quot;), no mail will be sent. Otherwise mail is
    sent to the owner of the crontab. This option is useful if you decide on
    <span class="Pa">/bin/mail</span> instead of
    <span class="Pa">/usr/lib/sendmail</span> as your mailer when you install
    cron -- <span class="Pa">/bin/mail</span> does not do aliasing, and UUCP
    usually does not read its mail.</p>
<p class="Pp" id="and">The format of a cron command is very much the V7
    standard, with a number of upward-compatible extensions. Each line has five
    time and date fields, followed by a user name (with optional
    ``:&lt;group&gt;'' and ``/&lt;login-class&gt;'' suffixes) if this is the
    system crontab file, followed by a command. Commands are executed by
    <a class="Xr">cron(8)</a> when the minute, hour, and month of year fields
    match the current time,
    <a class="permalink" href="#and"><i class="Em">and</i></a> when at least one
    of the two day fields (day of month, or day of week) matches the current
    time (see ``Note'' below). <a class="Xr">cron(8)</a> examines cron entries
    once every minute. The time and date fields are:</p>
<div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent Li">
<pre>field         allowed values
-----         --------------
minute        0-59
hour          0-23
day of month  1-31
month         1-12 (or names, see below)
day of week   0-7 (0 or 7 is Sun, or use names)</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">A field may be an asterisk (*), which always stands for
    ``first-last''.</p>
<p class="Pp">Ranges of numbers are allowed. Ranges are two numbers separated
    with a hyphen. The specified range is inclusive. For example, 8-11 for an
    ``hours'' entry specifies execution at hours 8, 9, 10 and 11.</p>
<p class="Pp">Lists are allowed. A list is a set of numbers (or ranges)
    separated by commas. Examples: ``1,2,5,9'', ``0-4,8-12''.</p>
<p class="Pp">Step values can be used in conjunction with ranges. Following a
    range with ``/&lt;number&gt;'' specifies skips of the number's value through
    the range. For example, ``0-23/2'' can be used in the hours field to specify
    command execution every other hour (the alternative in the V7 standard is
    ``0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20,22''). Steps are also permitted after an
    asterisk, so if you want to say ``every two hours'', just use ``*/2''.</p>
<p class="Pp">Names can also be used for the ``month'' and ``day of week''
    fields. Use the first three letters of the particular day or month (case
    does not matter). Ranges or lists of names are not allowed.</p>
<p class="Pp">The ``sixth'' field (the rest of the line) specifies the command
    to be run. The entire command portion of the line, up to a newline or %
    character, will be executed by <span class="Pa">/bin/sh</span> or by the
    shell specified in the <code class="Ev">SHELL</code> variable of the
    cronfile. Percent-signs (%) in the command, unless escaped with backslash
    (\), will be changed into newline characters, and all data after the first %
    will be sent to the command as standard input. The command can optionally be
    prefixed by ``@AppleNotOnBattery '' to tell cron not to run the command when
    functioning on battery power. For example, the ``sixth'' field when using
    this option would appear something like ``@AppleNotOnBattery /usr/bin/touch
    /tmp/foo''</p>
<p class="Pp" id="either">Note: The day of a command's execution can be
    specified by two fields &#x2014; day of month, and day of week. If both
    fields are restricted (ie, are not *), the command will be run when
    <a class="permalink" href="#either"><i class="Em">either</i></a> field
    matches the current time. For example, ``30 4 1,15 * 5'' would cause a
    command to be run at 4:30 am on the 1st and 15th of each month, plus every
    Friday.</p>
<p class="Pp">Instead of the first five fields, one of eight special strings may
    appear:</p>
<div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent Li">
<pre>string		meaning
------		-------
@reboot		Run once, at startup.
@yearly		Run once a year, &quot;0 0 1 1 *&quot;.
@annually	(same as @yearly)
@monthly	Run once a month, &quot;0 0 1 * *&quot;.
@weekly		Run once a week, &quot;0 0 * * 0&quot;.
@daily		Run once a day, &quot;0 0 * * *&quot;.
@midnight	(same as @daily)
@hourly		Run once an hour, &quot;0 * * * *&quot;.</pre>

<p class="Pp">When specifying day of week, both day 0 and day 7 will be
    considered Sunday. <span class="Ux">BSD</span> and ATT seem to disagree
    about this.</p>
<p class="Pp">Lists and ranges are allowed to co-exist in the same field.
    &quot;1-3,7-9&quot; would be rejected by ATT or <span class="Ux">BSD</span>
    cron -- they want to see &quot;1-3&quot; or &quot;7,8,9&quot; ONLY.</p>
<p class="Pp">Ranges can include &quot;steps&quot;, so &quot;1-9/2&quot; is the
    same as &quot;1,3,5,7,9&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">Names of months or days of the week can be specified by name.</p>
<p class="Pp">Environment variables can be set in the crontab. In
    <span class="Ux">BSD</span> or ATT, the environment handed to child
    processes is basically the one from <span class="Pa">/etc/rc</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Command output is mailed to the crontab owner
    (<span class="Ux">BSD</span> cannot do this), can be mailed to a person
    other than the crontab owner (SysV cannot do this), or the feature can be
    turned off and no mail will be sent at all (SysV cannot do this either).</p>
<p class="Pp">All of the &#x2018;@&#x2019; commands that can appear in place of
    the first five fields are extensions.</p>

<p class="Pp">If you are in one of the 70-odd countries that observe Daylight
    Savings Time, jobs scheduled during the rollback or advance will be
    affected. In general, it is not a good idea to schedule jobs during this
    period.</p>
<p class="Pp">For US timezones (except parts of IN, AZ, and HI) the time shift
    occurs at 2AM local time. For others, the output of the
    <a class="Xr">zdump(8)</a> program's verbose (<code class="Fl">-v</code>)
    option can be used to determine the moment of time shift.</p>
