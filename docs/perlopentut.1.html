Whenever you do I/O on a file in Perl, you do so through what in Perl is called
  a <b>filehandle</b>. A filehandle is an internal name for an external file. It
  is the job of the <span class="Li">&quot;open&quot;</span> function to make
  the association between the internal name and the external name, and it is the
  job of the <span class="Li">&quot;close&quot;</span> function to break that
  association.
<p class="Pp">For your convenience, Perl sets up a few special filehandles that
    are already open when you run. These include
    <span class="Li">&quot;STDIN&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;STDOUT&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;STDERR&quot;</span>, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;ARGV&quot;</span>. Since those are pre-opened, you
    can use them right away without having to go to the trouble of opening them
    yourself:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    print STDERR &quot;This is a debugging message.\n&quot;;

    print STDOUT &quot;Please enter something: &quot;;
    $response = &lt;STDIN&gt; // die &quot;how come no input?&quot;;
    print STDOUT &quot;Thank you!\n&quot;;

    while (&lt;ARGV&gt;) { ... }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">As you see from those examples,
    <span class="Li">&quot;STDOUT&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;STDERR&quot;</span> are output handles, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;STDIN&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;ARGV&quot;</span> are input handles. They are in all
    capital letters because they are reserved to Perl, much like the
    <span class="Li">@ARGV</span> array and the <span class="Li">%ENV</span>
    hash are. Their external associations were set up by your shell.</p>
<p class="Pp">You will need to open every other filehandle on your own. Although
    there are many variants, the most common way to call Perl's <b>open()</b>
    function is with three arguments and one return value:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot; </span><i>OK</i><span class="Li"> =
    open(</span> <i>HANDLE</i><span class="Li">,
    </span><i>MODE</i><span class="Li">,
    </span><i>PATHNAME</i><span class="Li">)&quot;</span></p>
<p class="Pp">Where:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><i>OK</i></dt>
  <dd>will be some defined value if the open succeeds, but
      <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> if it fails;</dd>
  <dt><i>HANDLE</i></dt>
  <dd>should be an undefined scalar variable to be filled in by the
      <span class="Li">&quot;open&quot;</span> function if it succeeds;</dd>
  <dt><i>MODE</i></dt>
  <dd>is the access mode and the encoding format to open the file with;</dd>
  <dt><i>PATHNAME</i></dt>
  <dd>is the external name of the file you want opened.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Most of the complexity of the
    <span class="Li">&quot;open&quot;</span> function lies in the many possible
    values that the <i>MODE</i> parameter can take on.</p>
<p class="Pp">One last thing before we show you how to open files: opening files
    does not (usually) automatically lock them in Perl. See perlfaq5 for how to
    lock.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Opening_Text_Files_for_Reading"><a class="permalink" href="#Opening_Text_Files_for_Reading">Opening
  Text Files for Reading</a></h2>
If you want to read from a text file, first open it in read-only mode like this:
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    my $filename = &quot;/some/path/to/a/textfile/goes/here&quot;;
    my $encoding = &quot;:encoding(UTF-8)&quot;;
    my $handle   = undef;     # this will be filled in on success

    open($handle, &quot;&lt; $encoding&quot;, $filename)
        || die &quot;$0: can't open $filename for reading: $!&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">As with the shell, in Perl the
    <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;&quot;</span> is used to open the file in
    read-only mode. If it succeeds, Perl allocates a brand new filehandle for
    you and fills in your previously undefined <span class="Li">$handle</span>
    argument with a reference to that handle.</p>
<p class="Pp">Now you may use functions like
    <span class="Li">&quot;readline&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;read&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;getc&quot;</span>, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;sysread&quot;</span> on that handle. Probably the
    most common input function is the one that looks like an operator:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    $line = readline($handle);
    $line = &lt;$handle&gt;;          # same thing
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Because the <span class="Li">&quot;readline&quot;</span> function
    returns <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> at end of file or upon
    error, you will sometimes see it used this way:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    $line = &lt;$handle&gt;;
    if (defined $line) {
        # do something with $line
    }
    else {
        # $line is not valid, so skip it
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">You can also just quickly <span class="Li">&quot;die&quot;</span>
    on an undefined value this way:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    $line = &lt;$handle&gt; // die &quot;no input found&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">However, if hitting EOF is an expected and normal event, you do
    not want to exit simply because you have run out of input. Instead, you
    probably just want to exit an input loop. You can then test to see if an
    actual error has caused the loop to terminate, and act accordingly:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    while (&lt;$handle&gt;) {
        # do something with data in $_
    }
    if ($!) {
        die &quot;unexpected error while reading from $filename: $!&quot;;
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><b>A Note on Encodings</b>: Having to specify the text encoding
    every time might seem a bit of a bother. To set up a default encoding for
    <span class="Li">&quot;open&quot;</span> so that you don't have to supply it
    each time, you can use the <span class="Li">&quot;open&quot;</span>
  pragma:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    use open qw&lt; :encoding(UTF-8) &gt;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Once you've done that, you can safely omit the encoding part of
    the open mode:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    open($handle, &quot;&lt;&quot;, $filename)
        || die &quot;$0: can't open $filename for reading: $!&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">But never use the bare <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;&quot;</span>
    without having set up a default encoding first. Otherwise, Perl cannot know
    which of the many, many, many possible flavors of text file you have, and
    Perl will have no idea how to correctly map the data in your file into
    actual characters it can work with. Other common encoding formats including
    <span class="Li">&quot;ASCII&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;ISO-8859-1&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;ISO-8859-15&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;Windows-1252&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;MacRoman&quot;</span>, and even
    <span class="Li">&quot;UTF-16LE&quot;</span>. See perlunitut for more about
    encodings.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Opening_Text_Files_for_Writing"><a class="permalink" href="#Opening_Text_Files_for_Writing">Opening
  Text Files for Writing</a></h2>
When you want to write to a file, you first have to decide what to do about any
  existing contents of that file. You have two basic choices here: to preserve
  or to clobber.
<p class="Pp">If you want to preserve any existing contents, then you want to
    open the file in append mode. As in the shell, in Perl you use
    <span class="Li">&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;</span> to open an existing file in
    append mode. <span class="Li">&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;</span> creates the file
    if it does not already exist.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    my $handle   = undef;
    my $filename = &quot;/some/path/to/a/textfile/goes/here&quot;;
    my $encoding = &quot;:encoding(UTF-8)&quot;;

    open($handle, &quot;&gt;&gt; $encoding&quot;, $filename)
        || die &quot;$0: can't open $filename for appending: $!&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Now you can write to that filehandle using any of
    <span class="Li">&quot;print&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;printf&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;say&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;write&quot;</span>, or
    <span class="Li">&quot;syswrite&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">As noted above, if the file does not already exist, then the
    append-mode open will create it for you. But if the file does already exist,
    its contents are safe from harm because you will be adding your new text
    past the end of the old text.</p>
<p class="Pp">On the other hand, sometimes you want to clobber whatever might
    already be there. To empty out a file before you start writing to it, you
    can open it in write-only mode:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    my $handle   = undef;
    my $filename = &quot;/some/path/to/a/textfile/goes/here&quot;;
    my $encoding = &quot;:encoding(UTF-8)&quot;;

    open($handle, &quot;&gt; $encoding&quot;, $filename)
        || die &quot;$0: can't open $filename in write-open mode: $!&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Here again Perl works just like the shell in that the
    <span class="Li">&quot;&gt;&quot;</span> clobbers an existing file.</p>
<p class="Pp">As with the append mode, when you open a file in write-only mode,
    you can now write to that filehandle using any of
    <span class="Li">&quot;print&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;printf&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;say&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;write&quot;</span>, or
    <span class="Li">&quot;syswrite&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">What about read-write mode? You should probably pretend it doesn't
    exist, because opening text files in read-write mode is unlikely to do what
    you would like. See perlfaq5 for details.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="Opening_Binary_Files"><a class="permalink" href="#Opening_Binary_Files">Opening
  Binary Files</a></h1>
If the file to be opened contains binary data instead of text characters, then
  the <span class="Li">&quot;MODE&quot;</span> argument to
  <span class="Li">&quot;open&quot;</span> is a little different. Instead of
  specifying the encoding, you tell Perl that your data are in raw bytes.
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    my $filename = &quot;/some/path/to/a/binary/file/goes/here&quot;;
    my $encoding = &quot;:raw :bytes&quot;
    my $handle   = undef;     # this will be filled in on success
</pre>
<p class="Pp">And then open as before, choosing
    <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;</span>, or
    <span class="Li">&quot;&gt;&quot;</span> as needed:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    open($handle, &quot;&lt; $encoding&quot;, $filename)
        || die &quot;$0: can't open $filename for reading: $!&quot;;

    open($handle, &quot;&gt;&gt; $encoding&quot;, $filename)
        || die &quot;$0: can't open $filename for appending: $!&quot;;

    open($handle, &quot;&gt; $encoding&quot;, $filename)
        || die &quot;$0: can't open $filename in write-open mode: $!&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Alternately, you can change to binary mode on an existing handle
    this way:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    binmode($handle)    || die &quot;cannot binmode handle&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This is especially handy for the handles that Perl has already
    opened for you.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    binmode(STDIN)      || die &quot;cannot binmode STDIN&quot;;
    binmode(STDOUT)     || die &quot;cannot binmode STDOUT&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">You can also pass <span class="Li">&quot;binmode&quot;</span> an
    explicit encoding to change it on the fly. This isn't exactly
    &quot;binary&quot; mode, but we still use
    <span class="Li">&quot;binmode&quot;</span> to do it:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  binmode(STDIN,  &quot;:encoding(MacRoman)&quot;) || die &quot;cannot binmode STDIN&quot;;
  binmode(STDOUT, &quot;:encoding(UTF-8)&quot;)    || die &quot;cannot binmode STDOUT&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Once you have your binary file properly opened in the right mode,
    you can use all the same Perl I/O functions as you used on text files.
    However, you may wish to use the fixed-size
    <span class="Li">&quot;read&quot;</span> instead of the variable-sized
    <span class="Li">&quot;readline&quot;</span> for your input.</p>
<p class="Pp">Here's an example of how to copy a binary file:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    my $BUFSIZ   = 64 * (2 ** 10);
    my $name_in  = &quot;/some/input/file&quot;;
    my $name_out = &quot;/some/output/flie&quot;;

    my($in_fh, $out_fh, $buffer);

    open($in_fh,  &quot;&lt;&quot;, $name_in)
        || die &quot;$0: cannot open $name_in for reading: $!&quot;;
    open($out_fh, &quot;&gt;&quot;, $name_out)
        || die &quot;$0: cannot open $name_out for writing: $!&quot;;

    for my $fh ($in_fh, $out_fh)  {
        binmode($fh)               || die &quot;binmode failed&quot;;
    }

    while (read($in_fh, $buffer, $BUFSIZ)) {
        unless (print $out_fh $buffer) {
            die &quot;couldn't write to $name_out: $!&quot;;
        }
    }

    close($in_fh)       || die &quot;couldn't close $name_in: $!&quot;;
    close($out_fh)      || die &quot;couldn't close $name_out: $!&quot;;
