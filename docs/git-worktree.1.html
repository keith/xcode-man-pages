<p class="Pp">Manage multiple working trees attached to the same repository.</p>
<p class="Pp">A git repository can support multiple working trees, allowing you
    to check out more than one branch at a time. With <b>git</b> <b>worktree</b>
    <b>add</b> a new working tree is associated with the repository, along with
    additional metadata that differentiates that working tree from others in the
    same repository. The working tree, along with this metadata, is called a
    &quot;worktree&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">This new worktree is called a &quot;linked worktree&quot; as
    opposed to the &quot;main worktree&quot; prepared by <b>git-init</b>(1) or
    <b>git-clone</b>(1). A repository has one main worktree (if it&#x2019;s not
    a bare repository) and zero or more linked worktrees. When you are done with
    a linked worktree, remove it with <b>git</b> <b>worktree</b>
  <b>remove</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">In its simplest form, <b>git</b> <b>worktree</b> <b>add</b>
    <i>&lt;path&gt;</i> automatically creates a new branch whose name is the
    final component of <i>&lt;path&gt;</i>, which is convenient if you plan to
    work on a new topic. For instance, <b>git</b> <b>worktree</b> <b>add</b>
    <b>..</b><b>/hotfix</b> creates new branch <b>hotfix</b> and checks it out
    at path <b>..</b><b>/hotfix</b>. To instead work on an existing branch in a
    new worktree, use <b>git</b> <b>worktree</b> <b>add</b> <i>&lt;path&gt;</i>
    <i>&lt;branch&gt;</i>. On the other hand, if you just plan to make some
    experimental changes or do testing without disturbing existing development,
    it is often convenient to create a <i>throwaway</i> worktree not associated
    with any branch. For instance, <b>git</b> <b>worktree</b> <b>add</b>
    <b>-d</b> <i>&lt;path&gt;</i> creates a new worktree with a detached
    <b>HEAD</b> at the same commit as the current branch.</p>
<p class="Pp">If a working tree is deleted without using <b>git</b>
    <b>worktree</b> <b>remove</b>, then its associated administrative files,
    which reside in the repository (see &quot;DETAILS&quot; below), will
    eventually be removed automatically (see <b>gc.worktreePruneExpire</b> in
    <b>git-config</b>(1)), or you can run <b>git</b> <b>worktree</b>
    <b>prune</b> in the main or any linked worktree to clean up any stale
    administrative files.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the working tree for a linked worktree is stored on a portable
    device or network share which is not always mounted, you can prevent its
    administrative files from being pruned by issuing the <b>git</b>
    <b>worktree</b> <b>lock</b> command, optionally specifying <b>--reason</b>
    to explain why the worktree is locked.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="COMMANDS"><a class="permalink" href="#COMMANDS">COMMANDS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">add &lt;path&gt; [&lt;commit-ish&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Create a worktree at <i>&lt;path&gt;</i> and checkout
  <i>&lt;commit-ish&gt;</i> into it. The new worktree is linked to the current
  repository, sharing everything except per-worktree files such as <b>HEAD</b>,
  <b>index</b>, etc. As a convenience, <i>&lt;commit-ish&gt;</i> may be a bare
  &quot;<b>-</b>&quot;, which is synonymous with <b>@</b>{-1}.
<p class="Pp">If <i>&lt;commit-ish&gt;</i> is a branch name (call it
    <i>&lt;branch&gt;</i>) and is not found, and neither <b>-b</b> nor <b>-B</b>
    nor <b>--detach</b> are used, but there does exist a tracking branch in
    exactly one remote (call it <i>&lt;remote&gt;</i>) with a matching name,
    treat as equivalent to:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ git worktree add --track -b &lt;branch&gt; &lt;path&gt; &lt;remote&gt;/&lt;branch&gt;</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">If the branch exists in multiple remotes and one of them is named
    by the <b>checkout.defaultRemote</b> configuration variable, we&#x2019;ll
    use that one for the purposes of disambiguation, even if the
    <i>&lt;branch&gt;</i> isn&#x2019;t unique across all remotes. Set it to e.g.
    <b>checkout.defaultRemote=origin</b> to always checkout remote branches from
    there if <i>&lt;branch&gt;</i> is ambiguous but exists on the <b>origin</b>
    remote. See also <b>checkout.defaultRemote</b> in <b>git-config</b>(1).</p>
<p class="Pp">If <i>&lt;commit-ish&gt;</i> is omitted and neither <b>-b</b> nor
    <b>-B</b> nor <b>--detach</b> used, then, as a convenience, the new worktree
    is associated with a branch (call it <i>&lt;branch&gt;</i>) named after
    <b>$</b>(<b>basename</b> <i>&lt;path&gt;</i>). If <i>&lt;branch&gt;</i>
    doesn&#x2019;t exist, a new branch based on <b>HEAD</b> is automatically
    created as if <b>-b</b> <i>&lt;branch&gt;</i> was given. If
    <i>&lt;branch&gt;</i> does exist, it will be checked out in the new
    worktree, if it&#x2019;s not checked out anywhere else, otherwise the
    command will refuse to create the worktree (unless <b>--force</b> is
  used).</p>
<p class="Pp">If <i>&lt;commit-ish&gt;</i> is omitted, neither <b>--detach</b>,
    or <b>--orphan</b> is used, and there are no valid local branches (or remote
    branches if <b>--guess-remote</b> is specified) then, as a convenience, the
    new worktree is associated with a new unborn branch named
    <i>&lt;branch&gt;</i> (after <b>$</b>(<b>basename</b> <i>&lt;path&gt;</i>)
    if neither <b>-b</b> or <b>-B</b> is used) as if <b>--orphan</b> was passed
    to the command. In the event the repository has a remote and
    <b>--guess-remote</b> is used, but no remote or local branches exist, then
    the command fails with a warning reminding the user to fetch from their
    remote first (or override by using <b>-f/--force</b>).</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">list</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">List details of each worktree. The main worktree is
  listed first, followed by each of the linked worktrees. The output details
  include whether the worktree is bare, the revision currently checked out, the
  branch currently checked out (or &quot;detached HEAD&quot; if none),
  &quot;locked&quot; if the worktree is locked, &quot;prunable&quot; if the
  worktree can be pruned by the <b>prune</b> command.</div>
<p class="Pp">lock</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If a worktree is on a portable device or network share
  which is not always mounted, lock it to prevent its administrative files from
  being pruned automatically. This also prevents it from being moved or deleted.
  Optionally, specify a reason for the lock with <b>--reason</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">move</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Move a worktree to a new location. Note that the main
  worktree or linked worktrees containing submodules cannot be moved with this
  command. (The <b>git</b> <b>worktree</b> <b>repair</b> command, however, can
  reestablish the connection with linked worktrees if you move the main worktree
  manually.)</div>
<p class="Pp">prune</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Prune worktree information in
  <b>$GIT_DIR/worktrees</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">remove</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Remove a worktree. Only clean worktrees (no untracked
  files and no modification in tracked files) can be removed. Unclean worktrees
  or ones with submodules can be removed with <b>--force</b>. The main worktree
  cannot be removed.</div>
<p class="Pp">repair [&lt;path&gt;...]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Repair worktree administrative files, if possible, if
  they have become corrupted or outdated due to external factors.
<p class="Pp">For instance, if the main worktree (or bare repository) is moved,
    linked worktrees will be unable to locate it. Running <b>repair</b> in the
    main worktree will reestablish the connection from linked worktrees back to
    the main worktree.</p>
<p class="Pp">Similarly, if the working tree for a linked worktree is moved
    without using <b>git</b> <b>worktree</b> <b>move</b>, the main worktree (or
    bare repository) will be unable to locate it. Running <b>repair</b> within
    the recently-moved worktree will reestablish the connection. If multiple
    linked worktrees are moved, running <b>repair</b> from any worktree with
    each tree&#x2019;s new <i>&lt;path&gt;</i> as an argument, will reestablish
    the connection to all the specified paths.</p>
<p class="Pp">If both the main worktree and linked worktrees have been moved or
    copied manually, then running <b>repair</b> in the main worktree and
    specifying the new <i>&lt;path&gt;</i> of each linked worktree will
    reestablish all connections in both directions.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">unlock</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Unlock a worktree, allowing it to be pruned, moved or
  deleted.</div>

  worktree path, specify <b>--force</b> twice.
<p class="Pp"><b>move</b> refuses to move a locked worktree unless

<h1 class="Sh" id="REFS"><a class="permalink" href="#REFS">REFS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">When using multiple worktrees, some refs are shared between all
    worktrees, but others are specific to an individual worktree. One example is
    <b>HEAD</b>, which is different for each worktree. This section is about the
    sharing rules and how to access refs of one worktree from another.</p>
<p class="Pp">In general, all pseudo refs are per-worktree and all refs starting
    with <b>refs/</b> are shared. Pseudo refs are ones like <b>HEAD</b> which
    are directly under <b>$GIT_DIR</b> instead of inside <b>$GIT_DIR/refs</b>.
    There are exceptions, however: refs inside <b>refs/bisect</b>,
    <b>refs/worktree</b> and <b>refs/rewritten</b> are not shared.</p>
<p class="Pp">Refs that are per-worktree can still be accessed from another
    worktree via two special paths, <b>main-worktree</b> and <b>worktrees</b>.
    The former gives access to per-worktree refs of the main worktree, while the
    latter to all linked worktrees.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, <b>main-worktree/HEAD</b> or
    <b>main-worktree/refs/bisect/good</b> resolve to the same value as the main
    worktree&#x2019;s <b>HEAD</b> and <b>refs/bisect/good</b> respectively.
    Similarly, <b>worktrees/foo/HEAD</b> or <b>worktrees/bar/refs/bisect/bad</b>
    are the same as <b>$GIT_COMMON_DIR/worktrees/foo/HEAD</b> and
    <b>$GIT_COMMON_DIR/worktrees/bar/refs/bisect/bad</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">To access refs, it&#x2019;s best not to look inside
    <b>$GIT_DIR</b> directly. Instead use commands such as
    <b>git-rev-parse</b>(1) or <b>git-update-ref</b>(1) which will handle refs
    correctly.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="CONFIGURATION_FILE"><a class="permalink" href="#CONFIGURATION_FILE">CONFIGURATION
  FILE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">By default, the repository <b>config</b> file is shared across all
    worktrees. If the config variables <b>core.bare</b> or <b>core.worktree</b>
    are present in the common config file and <b>extensions.worktreeConfig</b>
    is disabled, then they will be applied to the main worktree only.</p>
<p class="Pp">In order to have worktree-specific configuration, you can turn on
    the <b>worktreeConfig</b> extension, e.g.:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ git config extensions.worktreeConfig true</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">In this mode, specific configuration stays in the path pointed by
    <b>git</b> <b>rev-parse</b> <b>--git-path</b> <b>config.worktree</b>. You
    can add or update configuration in this file with <b>git</b> <b>config</b>
    <b>--worktree</b>. Older Git versions will refuse to access repositories
    with this extension.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that in this file, the exception for <b>core.bare</b> and
    <b>core.worktree</b> is gone. If they exist in <b>$GIT_DIR/config</b>, you
    must move them to the <b>config.worktree</b> of the main worktree. You may
    also take this opportunity to review and move other configuration that you
    do not want to share to all worktrees:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>core.worktree</b> should never be
  shared.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>core.bare</b> should not be shared if the
  value is <b>core.bare=true</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>core.sparseCheckout</b> should not be shared,
  unless you are sure you always use sparse checkout for all worktrees.</div>
<p class="Pp">See the documentation of <b>extensions.worktreeConfig</b> in
    <b>git-config</b>(1) for more details.</p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DETAILS"><a class="permalink" href="#DETAILS">DETAILS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Each linked worktree has a private sub-directory in the
    repository&#x2019;s <b>$GIT_DIR/worktrees</b> directory. The private
    sub-directory&#x2019;s name is usually the base name of the linked
    worktree&#x2019;s path, possibly appended with a number to make it unique.
    For example, when <b>$GIT_DIR=/path/main/.git</b> the command <b>git</b>
    <b>worktree</b> <b>add</b> <b>/path/other/test-next</b> <b>next</b> creates
    the linked worktree in <b>/path/other/test-next</b> and also creates a
    <b>$GIT_DIR/worktrees/test-next</b> directory (or
    <b>$GIT_DIR/worktrees/test-next1</b> if <b>test-next</b> is already
  taken).</p>
<p class="Pp">Within a linked worktree, <b>$GIT_DIR</b> is set to point to this
    private directory (e.g. <b>/path/main/.git/worktrees/test-next</b> in the
    example) and <b>$GIT_COMMON_DIR</b> is set to point back to the main
    worktree&#x2019;s <b>$GIT_DIR</b> (e.g. <b>/path/main/.git</b>). These
    settings are made in a .<b>git</b> file located at the top directory of the
    linked worktree.</p>
<p class="Pp">Path resolution via <b>git</b> <b>rev-parse</b> <b>--git-path</b>
    uses either <b>$GIT_DIR</b> or <b>$GIT_COMMON_DIR</b> depending on the path.
    For example, in the linked worktree <b>git</b> <b>rev-parse</b>
    <b>--git-path</b> <b>HEAD</b> returns
    <b>/path/main/.git/worktrees/test-next/HEAD</b> (not
    <b>/path/other/test-next/.git/HEAD</b> or <b>/path/main/.git/HEAD</b>) while
    <b>git</b> <b>rev-parse</b> <b>--git-path</b> <b>refs/heads/master</b> uses
    <b>$GIT_COMMON_DIR</b> and returns <b>/path/main/.git/refs/heads/master</b>,
    since refs are shared across all worktrees, except <b>refs/bisect</b>,
    <b>refs/worktree</b> and <b>refs/rewritten</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">See <b>gitrepository-layout</b>(5) for more information. The rule
    of thumb is do not make any assumption about whether a path belongs to
    <b>$GIT_DIR</b> or <b>$GIT_COMMON_DIR</b> when you need to directly access
    something inside <b>$GIT_DIR</b>. Use <b>git</b> <b>rev-parse</b>
    <b>--git-path</b> to get the final path.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you manually move a linked worktree, you need to update the
    <b>gitdir</b> file in the entry&#x2019;s directory. For example, if a linked
    worktree is moved to <b>/newpath/test-next</b> and its .<b>git</b> file
    points to <b>/path/main/.git/worktrees/test-next</b>, then update
    <b>/path/main/.git/worktrees/test-next/gitdir</b> to reference
    <b>/newpath/test-next</b> instead. Better yet, run <b>git</b>
    <b>worktree</b> <b>repair</b> to reestablish the connection
  automatically.</p>
<p class="Pp">To prevent a <b>$GIT_DIR/worktrees</b> entry from being pruned
    (which can be useful in some situations, such as when the entry&#x2019;s
    worktree is stored on a portable device), use the <b>git</b> <b>worktree</b>
    <b>lock</b> command, which adds a file named <b>locked</b> to the
    entry&#x2019;s directory. The file contains the reason in plain text. For
    example, if a linked worktree&#x2019;s .<b>git</b> file points to
    <b>/path/main/.git/worktrees/test-next</b> then a file named
    <b>/path/main/.git/worktrees/test-next/locked</b> will prevent the
    <b>test-next</b> entry from being pruned. See <b>gitrepository-layout</b>(5)
    for details.</p>
<p class="Pp">When <b>extensions.worktreeConfig</b> is enabled, the config file
    .<b>git/worktrees/</b><i>&lt;id&gt;</i><b>/config.worktree</b> is read after
    .<b>git/config</b> is.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="LIST_OUTPUT_FORMAT"><a class="permalink" href="#LIST_OUTPUT_FORMAT">LIST
  OUTPUT FORMAT</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The <b>worktree</b> <b>list</b> command has two output formats.
    The default format shows the details on a single line with columns. For
    example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ git worktree list
/path/to/bare-source            (bare)
/path/to/linked-worktree        abcd1234 [master]
/path/to/other-linked-worktree  1234abc  (detached HEAD)</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The command also shows annotations for each worktree, according to
    its state. These annotations are:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>locked</b>, if the worktree is locked.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>prunable</b>, if the worktree can be pruned
  via <b>git</b> <b>worktree</b> <b>prune</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ git worktree list
/path/to/linked-worktree    abcd1234 [master]
/path/to/locked-worktree    acbd5678 (brancha) locked
/path/to/prunable-worktree  5678abc  (detached HEAD) prunable</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">For these annotations, a reason might also be available and this
    can be seen using the verbose mode. The annotation is then moved to the next
    line indented followed by the additional information.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ git worktree list --verbose
/path/to/linked-worktree              abcd1234 [master]
/path/to/locked-worktree-no-reason    abcd5678 (detached HEAD) locked
/path/to/locked-worktree-with-reason  1234abcd (brancha)
<br/>
        locked: worktree path is mounted on a portable device
/path/to/prunable-worktree            5678abc1 (detached HEAD)
<br/>
        prunable: gitdir file points to non-existent location</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Note that the annotation is moved to the next line if the
    additional information is available, otherwise it stays on the same line as
    the worktree itself.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Porcelain_Format"><a class="permalink" href="#Porcelain_Format">Porcelain
  Format</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The porcelain format has a line per attribute. If <b>-z</b> is
    given then the lines are terminated with NUL rather than a newline.
    Attributes are listed with a label and value separated by a single space.
    Boolean attributes (like <b>bare</b> and <b>detached</b>) are listed as a
    label only, and are present only if the value is true. Some attributes (like
    <b>locked</b>) can be listed as a label only or with a value depending upon
    whether a reason is available. The first attribute of a worktree is always
    <b>worktree</b>, an empty line indicates the end of the record. For
  example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ git worktree list --porcelain
worktree /path/to/bare-source
bare
worktree /path/to/linked-worktree
HEAD abcd1234abcd1234abcd1234abcd1234abcd1234
branch refs/heads/master
worktree /path/to/other-linked-worktree
HEAD 1234abc1234abc1234abc1234abc1234abc1234a
detached
worktree /path/to/linked-worktree-locked-no-reason
HEAD 5678abc5678abc5678abc5678abc5678abc5678c
branch refs/heads/locked-no-reason
locked
worktree /path/to/linked-worktree-locked-with-reason
HEAD 3456def3456def3456def3456def3456def3456b
branch refs/heads/locked-with-reason
locked reason why is locked
worktree /path/to/linked-worktree-prunable
HEAD 1233def1234def1234def1234def1234def1234b
detached
prunable gitdir file points to non-existent location</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Unless <b>-z</b> is used any &quot;unusual&quot; characters in the
    lock reason such as newlines are escaped and the entire reason is quoted as
    explained for the configuration variable <b>core.quotePath</b> (see
    <b>git-config</b>(1)). For Example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ git worktree list --porcelain
...
locked &quot;reason\nwhy is locked&quot;
...</pre>

<p class="Pp">You are in the middle of a refactoring session and your boss comes
    in and demands that you fix something immediately. You might typically use
    <b>git-stash</b>(1) to store your changes away temporarily, however, your
    working tree is in such a state of disarray (with new, moved, and removed
    files, and other bits and pieces strewn around) that you don&#x2019;t want
    to risk disturbing any of it. Instead, you create a temporary linked
    worktree to make the emergency fix, remove it when done, and then resume
    your earlier refactoring session.</p>
