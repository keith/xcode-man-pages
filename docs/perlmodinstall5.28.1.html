perlmodinstall - Installing CPAN Modules
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
You can think of a module as the fundamental unit of reusable Perl code; see
  perlmod for details. Whenever anyone creates a chunk of Perl code that they
  think will be useful to the world, they register as a Perl developer at
  &lt;http://www.cpan.org/modules/04pause.html&gt; so that they can then upload
  their code to the CPAN. The CPAN is the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network and
  can be accessed at &lt;http://www.cpan.org/&gt; , and searched at
  &lt;http://search.cpan.org/&gt; .
<p class="Pp">This documentation is for people who want to download CPAN modules
    and install them on their own computer.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="_s-1PREAMBLE_s0"><a class="permalink" href="#_s-1PREAMBLE_s0">PREAMBLE</a></h2>
First, are you sure that the module isn't already on your system? Try
  <span class="Li">&quot;perl -MFoo -e 1&quot;</span>. (Replace &quot;Foo&quot;
  with the name of the module; for instance, <span class="Li">&quot;perl
  -MCGI::Carp -e 1&quot;</span>.)
<p class="Pp">If you don't see an error message, you have the module. (If you do
    see an error message, it's still possible you have the module, but that it's
    not in your path, which you can display with <span class="Li">&quot;perl
    -e</span> <span class="Li">&quot;print qq(@INC)&quot;&quot;</span>.) For the
    remainder of this document, we'll assume that you really honestly truly lack
    an installed module, but have found it on the CPAN.</p>
<p class="Pp">So now you have a file ending in .tar.gz (or, less often, .zip).
    You know there's a tasty module inside. There are four steps you must now
    take:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>DECOMPRESS</b> the file</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>UNPACK</b> the file into a directory</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>BUILD</b> the module (sometimes unnecessary)</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>INSTALL</b> the module.</dt>
  <dd></dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Here's how to perform each step for each operating system. This is
    &lt;not&gt; a substitute for reading the README and INSTALL files that might
    have come with your module!</p>
<p class="Pp">Also note that these instructions are tailored for installing the
    module into your system's repository of Perl modules, but you can install
    modules into any directory you wish. For instance, where I say
    <span class="Li">&quot;perl Makefile.PL&quot;</span>, you can substitute
    <span class="Li">&quot;perl Makefile.PL</span>
    <span class="Li">PREFIX=/my/perl_directory&quot;</span> to install the
    modules into <i>/my/perl_directory</i>. Then you can use the modules from
    your Perl programs with <span class="Li">&quot;use lib
    &quot;/my/perl_directory/lib/site_perl&quot;;&quot;</span> or sometimes just
    <span class="Li">&quot;use &quot;/my/perl_directory&quot;;&quot;</span>. If
    you're on a system that requires superuser/root access to install modules
    into the directories you see when you type <span class="Li">&quot;perl -e
    &quot;print qq(@INC)&quot;&quot;</span>, you'll want to install them into a
    local directory (such as your home directory) and use this approach.</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li><b>If you're on a Unix or Unix-like system,</b>
    <p class="Pp">You can use Andreas Koenig's CPAN module (
        &lt;http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/CPAN&gt; ) to automate the
        following steps, from DECOMPRESS through INSTALL.</p>
    <p class="Pp">A. DECOMPRESS</p>
    <p class="Pp">Decompress the file with <span class="Li">&quot;gzip -d
        yourmodule.tar.gz&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="Pp">You can get gzip from
      &lt;ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/&gt;</p>
    <p class="Pp">Or, you can combine this step with the next to save disk
        space:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
     gzip -dc yourmodule.tar.gz | tar -xof -
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">B. UNPACK</p>
    <p class="Pp">Unpack the result with <span class="Li">&quot;tar -xof
        yourmodule.tar&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="Pp">C. BUILD</p>
    <p class="Pp">Go into the newly-created directory and type:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
      perl Makefile.PL
      make test
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">or</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
      perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/my/perl_directory
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">to install it locally. (Remember that if you do this, you'll
        have to put <span class="Li">&quot;use lib
        &quot;/my/perl_directory&quot;;&quot;</span> near the top of the program
        that is to use this module.</p>
    <p class="Pp">D. INSTALL</p>
    <p class="Pp">While still in that directory, type:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
      make install
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Make sure you have the appropriate permissions to install the
        module in your Perl 5 library directory. Often, you'll need to be
      root.</p>
    <p class="Pp">That's all you need to do on Unix systems with dynamic
        linking. Most Unix systems have dynamic linking. If yours doesn't, or if
        for another reason you have a statically-linked perl, <b>and</b> the
        module requires compilation, you'll need to build a new Perl binary that
        includes the module. Again, you'll probably need to be root.</p>
  </li>
  <li><b>If you're running ActivePerl (Win95/98/2K/NT/XP, Linux, Solaris),</b>
    <p class="Pp">First, type <span class="Li">&quot;ppm&quot;</span> from a
        shell and see whether ActiveState's PPM repository has your module. If
        so, you can install it with <span class="Li">&quot;ppm&quot;</span> and
        you won't have to bother with any of the other steps here. You might be
        able to use the CPAN instructions from the &quot;Unix or Linux&quot;
        section above as well; give it a try. Otherwise, you'll have to follow
        the steps below.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
   A. DECOMPRESS
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">You can use the shareware Winzip (
        &lt;http://www.winzip.com&gt; ) to decompress and unpack modules.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
   B. UNPACK
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If you used WinZip, this was already done for you.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
   C. BUILD
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">You'll need the <span class="Li">&quot;nmake&quot;</span>
        utility, available at
        &lt;http://download.microsoft.com/download/vc15/Patch/1.52/W95/EN-US/nmake15.exe&gt;
        or dmake, available on CPAN.
      &lt;http://search.cpan.org/dist/dmake/&gt;</p>
    <p class="Pp">Does the module require compilation (i.e. does it have files
        that end in .xs, .c, .h, .y, .cc, .cxx, or .C)? If it does, life is now
        officially tough for you, because you have to compile the module
        yourself (no easy feat on Windows). You'll need a compiler such as
        Visual C++. Alternatively, you can download a pre-built PPM package from
        ActiveState.
        &lt;http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Downloads/ActivePerl/PPM/&gt;</p>
    <p class="Pp">Go into the newly-created directory and type:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
      perl Makefile.PL
      nmake test


   D. INSTALL
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">While still in that directory, type:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
      nmake install
    </pre>
  </li>
  <li><b>If you're on the DJGPP port of DOS,</b>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
   A. DECOMPRESS
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">djtarx ( &lt;ftp://ftp.delorie.com/pub/djgpp/current/v2/&gt; )
        will both uncompress and unpack.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
   B. UNPACK
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">See above.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
   C. BUILD
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Go into the newly-created directory and type:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
      perl Makefile.PL
      make test
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">You will need the packages mentioned in <i>README.dos</i> in
        the Perl distribution.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
   D. INSTALL
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">While still in that directory, type:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
     make install
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">You will need the packages mentioned in <i>README.dos</i> in
        the Perl distribution.</p>
  </li>
  <li><b>If you're on OS/2,</b>
    <p class="Pp">Get the EMX development suite and gzip/tar, from either Hobbes
        ( &lt;http://hobbes.nmsu.edu&gt; ) or Leo ( &lt;http://www.leo.org&gt;
        ), and then follow the instructions for Unix.</p>
  </li>
  <li><b>If you're on VMS,</b>
    <p class="Pp">When downloading from CPAN, save your file with a
        <span class="Li">&quot;.tgz&quot;</span> extension instead of
        <span class="Li">&quot;.tar.gz&quot;</span>. All other periods in the
        filename should be replaced with underscores. For example,
        <span class="Li">&quot;Your-Module-1.33.tar.gz&quot;</span> should be
        downloaded as
      <span class="Li">&quot;Your-Module-1_33.tgz&quot;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">A. DECOMPRESS</p>
    <p class="Pp">Type</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    gzip -d Your-Module.tgz
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">or, for zipped modules, type</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    unzip Your-Module.zip
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Executables for gzip, zip, and VMStar:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    http://www.hp.com/go/openvms/freeware/

    <p class="Pp">and their source code:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    http://www.fsf.org/order/ftp.html
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Note that GNU's gzip/gunzip is not the same as Info-ZIP's
        zip/unzip package. The former is a simple compression tool; the latter
        permits creation of multi-file archives.</p>
    <p class="Pp">B. UNPACK</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you're using VMStar:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
     VMStar xf Your-Module.tar
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Or, if you're fond of VMS command syntax:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
     tar/extract/verbose Your_Module.tar
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">C. BUILD</p>
    <p class="Pp">Make sure you have MMS (from Digital) or the freeware MMK (
        available from MadGoat at &lt;http://www.madgoat.com&gt; ). Then type
        this to create the DESCRIP.MMS for the module:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    perl Makefile.PL
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Now you're ready to build:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    mms test
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Substitute <span class="Li">&quot;mmk&quot;</span> for

Note that not all modules will work with on all platforms. See perlport for more
  information on portability issues. Read the documentation to see if the module
  will work on your system. There are basically three categories of modules that
  will not work &quot;out of the box&quot; with all platforms (with some
  possibility of overlap):
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li><b>Those that should, but don't.</b> These need to be fixed; consider
      contacting the author and possibly writing a patch.</li>
  <li><b>Those that need to be compiled, where the target platform</b>
      <b>doesn't have compilers readily available.</b> (These modules contain
      <i>.xs</i> or <i>.c</i> files, usually.) You might be able to find
      existing binaries on the CPAN or elsewhere, or you might want to try
      getting compilers and building it yourself, and then release the binary
      for other poor souls to use.</li>
  <li><b>Those that are targeted at a specific platform.</b> (Such as the
      Win32:: modules.) If the module is targeted specifically at a platform
      other than yours, you're out of luck, most likely.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">Check the CPAN Testers if a module should work with your platform
    but it doesn't behave as you'd expect, or you aren't sure whether or not a
    module will work under your platform. If the module you want isn't listed
    there, you can test it yourself and let CPAN Testers know, you can join CPAN
    Testers, or you can request it be tested.</p>

If you have any suggested changes for this page, let me know. Please don't send
  me mail asking for help on how to install your modules. There are too many
  modules, and too few Orwants, for me to be able to answer or even acknowledge
  all your questions. Contact the module author instead, ask someone familiar
  with Perl on your operating system, or if all else fails, file a ticket at
