  WriteMakefile(
      NAME              =&gt; &quot;Foo::Bar&quot;,

<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">This utility is designed to write a Makefile for an extension
    module from a Makefile.PL. It is based on the Makefile.SH model provided by
    Andy Dougherty and the perl5-porters.</p>
<p class="Pp">It splits the task of generating the Makefile into several
    subroutines that can be individually overridden. Each subroutine returns the
    text it wishes to have written to the Makefile.</p>
<p class="Pp">As there are various Make programs with incompatible syntax, which
    use operating system shells, again with incompatible syntax, it is important
    for users of this module to know which flavour of Make a Makefile has been
    written for so they'll use the correct one and won't have to face the
    possibly bewildering errors resulting from using the wrong one.</p>
<p class="Pp">On POSIX systems, that program will likely be GNU Make; on
    Microsoft Windows, it will be either Microsoft NMake, DMake or GNU Make. See
    the section on the &quot;MAKE&quot; parameter for details.</p>
<p class="Pp">ExtUtils::MakeMaker (EUMM) is object oriented. Each directory
    below the current directory that contains a Makefile.PL is treated as a
    separate object. This makes it possible to write an unlimited number of
    Makefiles with a single invocation of <b>WriteMakefile()</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">All inputs to WriteMakefile are Unicode characters, not just
    octets. EUMM seeks to handle all of these correctly. It is currently still
    not possible to portably use Unicode characters in module names, because
    this requires Perl to handle Unicode filenames, which is not yet the case on
    Windows.</p>
<p class="Pp">See ExtUtils::MakeMaker::FAQ for details of the design and
  usage.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Default_Makefile_Behaviour"><a class="permalink" href="#Default_Makefile_Behaviour">Default
  Makefile Behaviour</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The generated Makefile enables the user of the extension to
  invoke</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  perl Makefile.PL # optionally &quot;perl Makefile.PL verbose&quot;
  make
  make test        # optionally set TEST_VERBOSE=1
  make install     # See below
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The Makefile to be produced may be altered by adding arguments of
    the form <span class="Li">&quot;KEY=VALUE&quot;</span>. E.g.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  perl Makefile.PL INSTALL_BASE=~
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Other interesting targets in the generated Makefile are</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  make config     # to check if the Makefile is up-to-date
  make clean      # delete local temp files (Makefile gets renamed)
  make realclean  # delete derived files (including ./blib)
  make ci         # check in all the files in the MANIFEST file
  make dist       # see below the Distribution Support section
</pre>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="make_test"><a class="permalink" href="#make_test">make
  test</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">MakeMaker checks for the existence of a file named <i>test.pl</i>
    in the current directory, and if it exists it executes the script with the
    proper set of perl <span class="Li">&quot;-I&quot;</span> options.</p>
<p class="Pp">MakeMaker also checks for any files matching
    glob(&quot;t/*.t&quot;). It will execute all matching files in alphabetical
    order via the Test::Harness module with the
    <span class="Li">&quot;-I&quot;</span> switches set correctly.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can also organize your tests within subdirectories in the
    <i>t/</i> directory. To do so, use the <i>test</i> directive in your
    <i>Makefile.PL</i>. For example, if you had tests in:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    t/foo
    t/foo/bar
</pre>
<p class="Pp">You could tell make to run tests in both of those directories with
    the following directives:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    test =&gt; {TESTS =&gt; 't/*/*.t t/*/*/*.t'}
    test =&gt; {TESTS =&gt; 't/foo/*.t t/foo/bar/*.t'}
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The first will run all test files in all first-level
    subdirectories and all subdirectories they contain. The second will run
    tests in only the <i>t/foo</i> and <i>t/foo/bar</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you'd like to see the raw output of your tests, set the
    <span class="Li">&quot;TEST_VERBOSE&quot;</span> variable to true.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  make test TEST_VERBOSE=1
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If you want to run particular test files, set the
    <span class="Li">&quot;TEST_FILES&quot;</span> variable. It is possible to
    use globbing with this mechanism.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  make test TEST_FILES='t/foobar.t t/dagobah*.t'
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Windows users who are using
    <span class="Li">&quot;nmake&quot;</span> should note that due to a bug in
    <span class="Li">&quot;nmake&quot;</span>, when specifying
    <span class="Li">&quot;TEST_FILES&quot;</span> you must use back-slashes
    instead of forward-slashes.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  nmake test TEST_FILES='t\foobar.t t\dagobah*.t'
</pre>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="make_testdb"><a class="permalink" href="#make_testdb">make
  testdb</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">A useful variation of the above is the target
    <span class="Li">&quot;testdb&quot;</span>. It runs the test under the Perl
    debugger (see perldebug). If the file <i>test.pl</i> exists in the current
    directory, it is used for the test.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you want to debug some other testfile, set the
    <span class="Li">&quot;TEST_FILE&quot;</span> variable thusly:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  make testdb TEST_FILE=t/mytest.t
</pre>
<p class="Pp">By default the debugger is called using
    <span class="Li">&quot;-d&quot;</span> option to perl. If you want to
    specify some other option, set the
    <span class="Li">&quot;TESTDB_SW&quot;</span> variable:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  make testdb TESTDB_SW=-Dx
</pre>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="make_install"><a class="permalink" href="#make_install">make
  install</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">make alone puts all relevant files into directories that are named
    by the macros INST_LIB, INST_ARCHLIB, INST_SCRIPT, INST_MAN1DIR and
    INST_MAN3DIR. All these default to something below ./blib if you are
    <i>not</i> building below the perl source directory. If you <i>are</i>
    building below the perl source, INST_LIB and INST_ARCHLIB default to
    ../../lib, and INST_SCRIPT is not defined.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>install</i> target of the generated Makefile copies the
    files found below each of the INST_* directories to their INSTALL*
    counterparts. Which counterparts are chosen depends on the setting of
    INSTALLDIRS according to the following table:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>                                 INSTALLDIRS set to
                           perl        site          vendor
                 PERLPREFIX      SITEPREFIX          VENDORPREFIX
  INST_ARCHLIB   INSTALLARCHLIB  INSTALLSITEARCH     INSTALLVENDORARCH
  INST_LIB       INSTALLPRIVLIB  INSTALLSITELIB      INSTALLVENDORLIB
  INST_BIN       INSTALLBIN      INSTALLSITEBIN      INSTALLVENDORBIN
  INST_SCRIPT    INSTALLSCRIPT   INSTALLSITESCRIPT   INSTALLVENDORSCRIPT
  INST_MAN1DIR   INSTALLMAN1DIR  INSTALLSITEMAN1DIR  INSTALLVENDORMAN1DIR
  INST_MAN3DIR   INSTALLMAN3DIR  INSTALLSITEMAN3DIR  INSTALLVENDORMAN3DIR
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The INSTALL... macros in turn default to their
    <span class="Li">%Config</span> ($Config{installprivlib},
    <span class="Li">$Config</span>{installarchlib}, etc.) counterparts.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can check the values of these variables on your system
  with</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    perl '-V:install.*'
</pre>
<p class="Pp">And to check the sequence in which the library directories are
    searched by perl, run</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    perl -le 'print join $/, @INC'
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Sometimes older versions of the module you're installing live in
    other directories in <span class="Li">@INC</span>. Because Perl loads the
    first version of a module it finds, not the newest, you might accidentally
    get one of these older versions even after installing a brand new version.
    To delete <i>all other</i> <i>versions of the module you're installing</i>
    (not simply older ones) set the <span class="Li">&quot;UNINST&quot;</span>
    variable.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    make install UNINST=1
</pre>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">INSTALL_BASE</h2>
<p class="Pp">INSTALL_BASE can be passed into Makefile.PL to change where your
    module will be installed. INSTALL_BASE is more like what everyone else calls
    &quot;prefix&quot; than PREFIX is.</p>
<p class="Pp">To have everything installed in your home directory, do the
    following.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    # Unix users, INSTALL_BASE=~ works fine
    perl Makefile.PL INSTALL_BASE=/path/to/your/home/dir
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Like PREFIX, it sets several INSTALL* attributes at once. Unlike
    PREFIX it is easy to predict where the module will end up. The installation
    pattern looks like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    INSTALLARCHLIB     INSTALL_BASE/lib/perl5/$Config{archname}
    INSTALLPRIVLIB     INSTALL_BASE/lib/perl5
    INSTALLBIN         INSTALL_BASE/bin
    INSTALLSCRIPT      INSTALL_BASE/bin
    INSTALLMAN1DIR     INSTALL_BASE/man/man1
    INSTALLMAN3DIR     INSTALL_BASE/man/man3
</pre>
<p class="Pp">INSTALL_BASE in MakeMaker and
    <span class="Li">&quot;--install_base&quot;</span> in Module::Build (as of
    0.28) install to the same location. If you want MakeMaker and Module::Build
    to install to the same location simply set INSTALL_BASE and
    <span class="Li">&quot;--install_base&quot;</span> to the same location.</p>
<p class="Pp">INSTALL_BASE was added in 6.31.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">PREFIX and LIB attribute</h2>
<p class="Pp">PREFIX and LIB can be used to set several INSTALL* attributes in
    one go. Here's an example for installing into your home directory.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    # Unix users, PREFIX=~ works fine
    perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/path/to/your/home/dir
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This will install all files in the module under your home
    directory, with man pages and libraries going into an appropriate place
    (usually ~/man and ~/lib). How the exact location is determined is
    complicated and depends on how your Perl was configured. INSTALL_BASE works
    more like what other build systems call &quot;prefix&quot; than PREFIX and
    we recommend you use that instead.</p>
<p class="Pp">Another way to specify many INSTALL directories with a single
    parameter is LIB.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    perl Makefile.PL LIB=~/lib
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This will install the module's architecture-independent files into
    ~/lib, the architecture-dependent files into ~/lib/$archname.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note, that in both cases the tilde expansion is done by MakeMaker,
    not by perl by default, nor by make.</p>
<p class="Pp">Conflicts between parameters LIB, PREFIX and the various INSTALL*
    arguments are resolved so that:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>setting LIB overrides any setting of INSTALLPRIVLIB, INSTALLARCHLIB,
      INSTALLSITELIB, INSTALLSITEARCH (and they are not affected by
    PREFIX);</li>
  <li>without LIB, setting PREFIX replaces the initial
      <span class="Li">$Config{prefix}</span> part of those INSTALL* arguments,
      even if the latter are explicitly set (but are set to still start with
      <span class="Li">$Config{prefix}</span>).</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">If the user has superuser privileges, and is not working on AFS or
    relatives, then the defaults for INSTALLPRIVLIB, INSTALLARCHLIB,
    INSTALLSCRIPT, etc. will be appropriate, and this incantation will be the
    best:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    perl Makefile.PL;
    make;
    make test
    make install
</pre>
<p class="Pp">make install by default writes some documentation of what has been
    done into the file
    <span class="Li">&quot;$(INSTALLARCHLIB)/perllocal.pod&quot;</span>. This
    feature can be bypassed by calling make pure_install.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">AFS users</h2>
<p class="Pp">will have to specify the installation directories as these most
    probably have changed since perl itself has been installed. They will have
    to do this by calling</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    perl Makefile.PL INSTALLSITELIB=/afs/here/today \
        INSTALLSCRIPT=/afs/there/now INSTALLMAN3DIR=/afs/for/manpages
    make
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Be careful to repeat this procedure every time you recompile an
    extension, unless you are sure the AFS installation directories are still
    valid.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Static_Linking_of_a_new_Perl_Binary"><a class="permalink" href="#Static_Linking_of_a_new_Perl_Binary">Static
  Linking of a new Perl Binary</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">An extension that is built with the above steps is ready to use on
    systems supporting dynamic loading. On systems that do not support dynamic
    loading, any newly created extension has to be linked together with the
    available resources. MakeMaker supports the linking process by creating
    appropriate targets in the Makefile whenever an extension is built. You can
    invoke the corresponding section of the makefile with</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    make perl
</pre>
<p class="Pp">That produces a new perl binary in the current directory with all
    extensions linked in that can be found in INST_ARCHLIB, SITELIBEXP, and
    PERL_ARCHLIB. To do that, MakeMaker writes a new Makefile, on UNIX, this is
    called <i>Makefile.aperl</i> (may be system dependent). If you want to force
    the creation of a new perl, it is recommended that you delete this
    <i>Makefile.aperl</i>, so the directories are searched through for linkable
    libraries again.</p>
<p class="Pp">The binary can be installed into the directory where perl normally
    resides on your machine with</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    make inst_perl
</pre>
<p class="Pp">To produce a perl binary with a different name than
    <span class="Li">&quot;perl&quot;</span>, either say</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    perl Makefile.PL MAP_TARGET=myperl
    make myperl
    make inst_perl
</pre>
<p class="Pp">or say</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    perl Makefile.PL
    make myperl MAP_TARGET=myperl
    make inst_perl MAP_TARGET=myperl
</pre>
<p class="Pp">In any case you will be prompted with the correct invocation of
    the <span class="Li">&quot;inst_perl&quot;</span> target that installs the
    new binary into INSTALLBIN.</p>
<p class="Pp">make inst_perl by default writes some documentation of what has
    been done into the file
    <span class="Li">&quot;$(INSTALLARCHLIB)/perllocal.pod&quot;</span>. This
    can be bypassed by calling make pure_inst_perl.</p>
<p class="Pp">Warning: the inst_perl: target will most probably overwrite your
    existing perl binary. Use with care!</p>
<p class="Pp">Sometimes you might want to build a statically linked perl
    although your system supports dynamic loading. In this case you may
    explicitly set the linktype with the invocation of the Makefile.PL or
  make:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    perl Makefile.PL LINKTYPE=static    # recommended
</pre>
<p class="Pp">or</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    make LINKTYPE=static                # works on most systems
</pre>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Determination_of_Perl_Library_and_Installation_Locations"><a class="permalink" href="#Determination_of_Perl_Library_and_Installation_Locations">Determination
  of Perl Library and Installation Locations</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">MakeMaker needs to know, or to guess, where certain things are
    located. Especially INST_LIB and INST_ARCHLIB (where to put the files during
    the <b>make</b>(1) run), PERL_LIB and PERL_ARCHLIB (where to read existing
    modules from), and PERL_INC (header files and
    <span class="Li">&quot;libperl*.*&quot;</span>).</p>
<p class="Pp">Extensions may be built either using the contents of the perl
    source directory tree or from the installed perl library. The recommended
    way is to build extensions after you have run 'make install' on perl itself.
    You can do that in any directory on your hard disk that is not below the
    perl source tree. The support for extensions below the ext directory of the
    perl distribution is only good for the standard extensions that come with
    perl.</p>
<p class="Pp">If an extension is being built below the
    <span class="Li">&quot;ext/&quot;</span> directory of the perl source then
    MakeMaker will set PERL_SRC automatically (e.g.,
    <span class="Li">&quot;../..&quot;</span>). If PERL_SRC is defined and the
    extension is recognized as a standard extension, then other variables
    default to the following:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  PERL_INC     = PERL_SRC
  PERL_LIB     = PERL_SRC/lib
  PERL_ARCHLIB = PERL_SRC/lib
  INST_LIB     = PERL_LIB
  INST_ARCHLIB = PERL_ARCHLIB
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If an extension is being built away from the perl source then
    MakeMaker will leave PERL_SRC undefined and default to using the installed
    copy of the perl library. The other variables default to the following:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  PERL_INC     = $archlibexp/CORE
  PERL_LIB     = $privlibexp
  PERL_ARCHLIB = $archlibexp
  INST_LIB     = ./blib/lib
  INST_ARCHLIB = ./blib/arch
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If perl has not yet been installed then PERL_SRC can be defined on
    the command line as shown in the previous section.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Which_architecture_dependent_directory?"><a class="permalink" href="#Which_architecture_dependent_directory?">Which
  architecture dependent directory?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">If you don't want to keep the defaults for the INSTALL* macros,
    MakeMaker helps you to minimize the typing needed: the usual relationship
    between INSTALLPRIVLIB and INSTALLARCHLIB is determined by Configure at perl
    compilation time. MakeMaker supports the user who sets INSTALLPRIVLIB. If
    INSTALLPRIVLIB is set, but INSTALLARCHLIB not, then MakeMaker defaults the
    latter to be the same subdirectory of INSTALLPRIVLIB as Configure decided
    for the counterparts in <span class="Li">%Config</span>, otherwise it
    defaults to INSTALLPRIVLIB. The same relationship holds for INSTALLSITELIB
    and INSTALLSITEARCH.</p>
<p class="Pp">MakeMaker gives you much more freedom than needed to configure
    internal variables and get different results. It is worth mentioning that
    <b>make</b>(1) also lets you configure most of the variables that are used
    in the Makefile. But in the majority of situations this will not be
    necessary, and should only be done if the author of a package recommends it
    (or you know what you're doing).</p>

  <dd>MakeMaker can run programs to generate files for you at build time. By
      default any file named *.PL (except Makefile.PL and Build.PL) in the top
      level directory will be assumed to be a Perl program and run passing its
      own basename in as an argument. This basename is actually a build target,
      and there is an intention, but not a requirement, that the *.PL file make
      the file passed to to as an argument. For example...
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    perl foo.PL foo
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This behavior can be overridden by supplying your own set of
        files to search. PL_FILES accepts a hash ref, the key being the file to
        run and the value is passed in as the first argument when the PL file is
        run.</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    PL_FILES =&gt; {'bin/foobar.PL' =&gt; 'bin/foobar'}
    PL_FILES =&gt; {'foo.PL' =&gt; 'foo.c'}

    <p class="Pp">Would run bin/foobar.PL like this:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    perl bin/foobar.PL bin/foobar
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If multiple files from one program are desired an array ref
        can be used.</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    PL_FILES =&gt; {'bin/foobar.PL' =&gt; [qw(bin/foobar1 bin/foobar2)]}
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">In this case the program will be run multiple times using each
        target file.</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    perl bin/foobar.PL bin/foobar1
    perl bin/foobar.PL bin/foobar2
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If an output file depends on extra input files beside the
        script itself, a hash ref can be used in version 7.36 and above:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    PL_FILES =&gt; { 'foo.PL' =&gt; {
        'foo.out' =&gt; 'foo.in',
        'bar.out' =&gt; [qw(bar1.in bar2.in)],
    }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">In this case the extra input files will be passed to the
        program after the target file:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>   perl foo.PL foo.out foo.in
   perl foo.PL bar.out bar1.in bar2.in
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">PL files are normally run <b>after</b> pm_to_blib and include
        INST_LIB and INST_ARCH in their <span class="Li">@INC</span>, so the
        just built modules can be accessed... unless the PL file is making a
        module (or anything else in PM) in which case it is run <b>before</b>
        pm_to_blib and does not include INST_LIB and INST_ARCH in its
        <span class="Li">@INC</span>. This apparently odd behavior is there for
        backwards compatibility (and it's somewhat DWIM). The argument passed to
        the .PL is set up as a target to build in the Makefile. In other
        sections such as <span class="Li">&quot;postamble&quot;</span> you can
        specify a dependency on the filename/argument that the .PL is supposed
        (or will have, now that that is is a dependency) to generate. Note the
        file to be generated will still be generated and the .PL will still run
        even without an explicit dependency created by you, since the
        <span class="Li">&quot;all&quot;</span> target still depends on running

<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        sub MY::c_o { &quot;new literal text&quot; }

  Meta-Data (META and MYMETA)</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Long plaguing users of MakeMaker based modules has been the
    problem of getting basic information about the module out of the sources
    <i>without</i> running the <i>Makefile.PL</i> and doing a bunch of messy
    heuristics on the resulting <i>Makefile</i>. Over the years, it has become
    standard to keep this information in one or more CPAN Meta files distributed
    with each distribution.</p>
<p class="Pp">The original format of CPAN Meta files was YAML and the
    corresponding file was called <i>META.yml</i>. In 2010, version 2 of the
    CPAN::Meta::Spec was released, which mandates JSON format for the metadata
    in order to overcome certain compatibility issues between YAML serializers
    and to avoid breaking older clients unable to handle a new version of the
    spec. The CPAN::Meta library is now standard for accessing old and new-style
    Meta files.</p>
<p class="Pp">If CPAN::Meta is installed, MakeMaker will automatically generate
    <i>META.json</i> and <i>META.yml</i> files for you and add them to your
    <i>MANIFEST</i> as part of the 'distdir' target (and thus the 'dist'
    target). This is intended to seamlessly and rapidly populate CPAN with
    module meta-data. If you wish to shut this feature off, set the
    <span class="Li">&quot;NO_META&quot;</span>
    <span class="Li">&quot;WriteMakefile()&quot;</span> flag to true.</p>
<p class="Pp">At the 2008 QA Hackathon in Oslo, Perl module toolchain
    maintainers agreed to use the CPAN Meta format to communicate
    post-configuration requirements between toolchain components. These files,
    <i>MYMETA.json</i> and <i>MYMETA.yml</i>, are generated when
    <i>Makefile.PL</i> generates a <i>Makefile</i> (if CPAN::Meta is installed).
    Clients like CPAN or CPANPLUS will read these files to see what
    prerequisites must be fulfilled before building or testing the distribution.
    If you wish to shut this feature off, set the
    <span class="Li">&quot;NO_MYMETA&quot;</span>
    <span class="Li">&quot;WriteMakeFile()&quot;</span> flag to true.</p>

<p class="Pp">If some events detected in <i>Makefile.PL</i> imply that there is
    no way to create the Module, but this is a normal state of things, then you
    can create a <i>Makefile</i> which does nothing, but succeeds on all the
    &quot;usual&quot; build targets. To do so, use</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    use ExtUtils::MakeMaker qw(WriteEmptyMakefile);
    WriteEmptyMakefile();
</pre>
<p class="Pp">instead of <b>WriteMakefile()</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">This may be useful if other modules expect this module to be
    <i>built</i> OK, as opposed to <i>work</i> OK (say, this system-dependent
    module builds in a subdirectory of some other distribution, or is listed as
    a dependency in a CPAN::Bundle, but the functionality is supported by
    different means on the current architecture).</p>

<p class="Pp">Module::Build is a pure-Perl alternative to MakeMaker which does

    to suit your needs.</p>
<p class="Pp">Module::Build::Tiny is a minimal pure-Perl alternative to
    MakeMaker that follows the Build.PL protocol of Module::Build but without
    its complexity and cruft, implementing only the installation of the module
    and leaving authoring to mbtiny or other authoring tools.</p>
<p class="Pp">Module::Install is a (now discouraged) wrapper around MakeMaker
    which adds features not normally available.</p>

    shared files after installation. Test::File::ShareDir helps when writing
    tests to use the shared files both before and after installation.</p>
<p class="Pp">Dist::Zilla is an authoring tool which allows great customization
    and extensibility of the author experience, relying on the existing install
    tools like ExtUtils::MakeMaker only for installation.</p>
