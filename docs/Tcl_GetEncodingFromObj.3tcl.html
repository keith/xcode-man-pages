   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

These routines convert between Tcl's internal character representation, UTF-8,
  and character representations used by various operating systems or file
  systems, such as Unicode, ASCII, or Shift-JIS. When operating on strings, such
  as such as obtaining the names of files or displaying characters using
  international fonts, the strings must be translated into one or possibly
  multiple formats that the various system calls can use. For instance, on a
  Japanese Unix workstation, a user might obtain a filename represented in the
  EUC-JP file encoding and then translate the characters to the jisx0208 font
  encoding in order to display the filename in a Tk widget. The purpose of the
  encoding package is to help bridge the translation gap. UTF-8 provides an
  intermediate staging ground for all the various encodings. In the example
  above, text would be translated into UTF-8 from whatever file encoding the
  operating system is using. Then it would be translated from UTF-8 into
  whatever font encoding the display routines require.
<p class="Pp">Some basic encodings are compiled into Tcl. Others can be defined
    by the user or dynamically loaded from encoding files in a
    platform-independent manner.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>Tcl_GetEncoding</b> finds an encoding given its <i>name</i>. The name may
  refer to a built-in Tcl encoding, a user-defined encoding registered by
  calling <b>Tcl_CreateEncoding</b>, or a dynamically-loadable encoding file.
  The return value is a token that represents the encoding and can be used in
  subsequent calls to procedures such as <b>Tcl_GetEncodingName</b>,
  <b>Tcl_FreeEncoding</b>, and <b>Tcl_UtfToExternal</b>. If the name did not
  refer to any known or loadable encoding, NULL is returned and an error message
  is returned in <i>interp</i>.
<p class="Pp">The encoding package maintains a database of all encodings
    currently in use. The first time <i>name</i> is seen, <b>Tcl_GetEncoding</b>
    returns an encoding with a reference count of 1. If the same <i>name</i> is
    requested further times, then the reference count for that encoding is
    incremented without the overhead of allocating a new encoding and all its
    associated data structures.</p>
<p class="Pp">When an <i>encoding</i> is no longer needed,
    <b>Tcl_FreeEncoding</b> should be called to release it. When an
    <i>encoding</i> is no longer in use anywhere (i.e., it has been freed as
    many times as it has been gotten) <b>Tcl_FreeEncoding</b> will release all
    storage the encoding was using and delete it from the database.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_GetEncodingFromObj</b> treats the string representation of
    <i>objPtr</i> as an encoding name, and finds an encoding with that name,
    just as <b>Tcl_GetEncoding</b> does. When an encoding is found, it is cached
    within the <b>objPtr</b> value for future reference, the <b>Tcl_Encoding</b>
    token is written to the storage pointed to by <i>encodingPtr</i>, and the
    value <b>TCL_OK</b> is returned. If no such encoding is found, the value
    <b>TCL_ERROR</b> is returned, and no writing to <b>*</b><i>encodingPtr</i>
    takes place. Just as with <b>Tcl_GetEncoding</b>, the caller should call
    <b>Tcl_FreeEncoding</b> on the resulting encoding token when that token will
    no longer be used.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_ExternalToUtfDString</b> converts a source buffer
    <i>src</i> from the specified <i>encoding</i> into UTF-8. The converted
    bytes are stored in <i>dstPtr</i>, which is then null-terminated. The caller
    should eventually call <b>Tcl_DStringFree</b> to free any information stored
    in <i>dstPtr</i>. When converting, if any of the characters in the source
    buffer cannot be represented in the target encoding, a default fallback
    character will be used. The return value is a pointer to the value stored in
    the DString.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_ExternalToUtf</b> converts a source buffer <i>src</i> from
    the specified <i>encoding</i> into UTF-8. Up to <i>srcLen</i> bytes are
    converted from the source buffer and up to <i>dstLen</i> converted bytes are
    stored in <i>dst</i>. In all cases, <i>*srcReadPtr</i> is filled with the
    number of bytes that were successfully converted from <i>src</i> and
    <i>*dstWrotePtr</i> is filled with the corresponding number of bytes that
    were stored in <i>dst</i>. The return value is one of the following:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>TCL_OK</b></dt>
  <dd>All bytes of <i>src</i> were converted.</dd>
  <dt><b>TCL_CONVERT_NOSPACE</b></dt>
  <dd>The destination buffer was not large enough for all of the converted data;
      as many characters as could fit were converted though.</dd>
  <dt><b>TCL_CONVERT_MULTIBYTE</b></dt>
  <dd>The last few bytes in the source buffer were the beginning of a multibyte
      sequence, but more bytes were needed to complete this sequence. A
      subsequent call to the conversion routine should pass a buffer containing
      the unconverted bytes that remained in <i>src</i> plus some further bytes
      from the source stream to properly convert the formerly split-up multibyte
      sequence.</dd>
  <dt><b>TCL_CONVERT_SYNTAX</b></dt>
  <dd>The source buffer contained an invalid character sequence. This may occur
      if the input stream has been damaged or if the input encoding method was
      misidentified.</dd>
  <dt><b>TCL_CONVERT_UNKNOWN</b></dt>
  <dd>The source buffer contained a character that could not be represented in
      the target encoding and <b>TCL_ENCODING_STOPONERROR</b> was
    specified.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_UtfToExternalDString</b> converts a source buffer
    <i>src</i> from UTF-8 into the specified <i>encoding</i>. The converted
    bytes are stored in <i>dstPtr</i>, which is then terminated with the
    appropriate encoding-specific null. The caller should eventually call
    <b>Tcl_DStringFree</b> to free any information stored in <i>dstPtr</i>. When
    converting, if any of the characters in the source buffer cannot be
    represented in the target encoding, a default fallback character will be
    used. The return value is a pointer to the value stored in the DString.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_UtfToExternal</b> converts a source buffer <i>src</i> from
    UTF-8 into the specified <i>encoding</i>. Up to <i>srcLen</i> bytes are
    converted from the source buffer and up to <i>dstLen</i> converted bytes are
    stored in <i>dst</i>. In all cases, <i>*srcReadPtr</i> is filled with the
    number of bytes that were successfully converted from <i>src</i> and
    <i>*dstWrotePtr</i> is filled with the corresponding number of bytes that
    were stored in <i>dst</i>. The return values are the same as the return
    values for <b>Tcl_ExternalToUtf</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_WinUtfToTChar</b> and <b>Tcl_WinTCharToUtf</b> are
    Windows-only convenience functions for converting between UTF-8 and Windows
    strings. On Windows 95 (as with the Unix operating system), all strings
    exchanged between Tcl and the operating system are &#x201C;char&#x201D;
    based. On Windows NT, some strings exchanged between Tcl and the operating
    system are &#x201C;char&#x201D; oriented while others are in Unicode. By
    convention, in Windows a TCHAR is a character in the ANSI code page on
    Windows 95 and a Unicode character on Windows NT.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you planned to use the same &#x201C;char&#x201D; based
    interfaces on both Windows 95 and Windows NT, you could use
    <b>Tcl_UtfToExternal</b> and <b>Tcl_ExternalToUtf</b> (or their
    <b>Tcl_DString</b> equivalents) with an encoding of NULL (the current system
    encoding). On the other hand, if you planned to use the Unicode interface
    when running on Windows NT and the &#x201C;char&#x201D; interfaces when
    running on Windows 95, you would have to perform the following type of test
    over and over in your program (as represented in pseudo-code):</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
if (running NT) {
    encoding &lt;- Tcl_GetEncoding(&quot;unicode&quot;);
    nativeBuffer &lt;- Tcl_UtfToExternal(encoding, utfBuffer);
    Tcl_FreeEncoding(encoding);
} else {
    nativeBuffer &lt;- Tcl_UtfToExternal(NULL, utfBuffer);
}
</pre>
</div>
<b>Tcl_WinUtfToTChar</b> and <b>Tcl_WinTCharToUtf</b> automatically handle this
  test and use the proper encoding based on the current operating system.
  <b>Tcl_WinUtfToTChar</b> returns a pointer to a TCHAR string, and
  <b>Tcl_WinTCharToUtf</b> expects a TCHAR string pointer as the <i>src</i>
  string. Otherwise, these functions behave identically to
  <b>Tcl_UtfToExternalDString</b> and <b>Tcl_ExternalToUtfDString</b>.
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_GetEncodingName</b> is roughly the inverse of
    <b>Tcl_GetEncoding</b>. Given an <i>encoding</i>, the return value is the
    <i>name</i> argument that was used to create the encoding. The string
    returned by <b>Tcl_GetEncodingName</b> is only guaranteed to persist until
    the <i>encoding</i> is deleted. The caller must not modify this string.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_SetSystemEncoding</b> sets the default encoding that should
    be used whenever the user passes a NULL value for the <i>encoding</i>
    argument to any of the other encoding functions. If <i>name</i> is NULL, the
    system encoding is reset to the default system encoding, <b>binary</b>. If
    the name did not refer to any known or loadable encoding, <b>TCL_ERROR</b>
    is returned and an error message is left in <i>interp</i>. Otherwise, this
    procedure increments the reference count of the new system encoding,
    decrements the reference count of the old system encoding, and returns
    <b>TCL_OK</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_GetEncodingNameFromEnvironment</b> provides a means for the
    Tcl library to report the encoding name it believes to be the correct one to
    use as the system encoding, based on system calls and examination of the
    environment suitable for the platform. It accepts <i>bufPtr</i>, a pointer
    to an uninitialized or freed <b>Tcl_DString</b> and writes the encoding name
    to it. The <b>Tcl_DStringValue</b> is returned.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_GetEncodingNames</b> sets the <i>interp</i> result to a
    list consisting of the names of all the encodings that are currently defined
    or can be dynamically loaded, searching the encoding path specified by
    <b>Tcl_SetDefaultEncodingDir</b>. This procedure does not ensure that the
    dynamically-loadable encoding files contain valid data, but merely that they
    exist.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_CreateEncoding</b> defines a new encoding and registers the
    C procedures that are called back to convert between the encoding and UTF-8.
    Encodings created by <b>Tcl_CreateEncoding</b> are thereafter visible in the
    database used by <b>Tcl_GetEncoding</b>. Just as with the
    <b>Tcl_GetEncoding</b> procedure, the return value is a token that
    represents the encoding and can be used in subsequent calls to other
    encoding functions. <b>Tcl_CreateEncoding</b> returns an encoding with a
    reference count of 1. If an encoding with the specified <i>name</i> already
    exists, then its entry in the database is replaced with the new encoding;
    the token for the old encoding will remain valid and continue to behave as
    before, but users of the new token will now call the new encoding
    procedures.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>typePtr</i> argument to <b>Tcl_CreateEncoding</b> contains
    information about the name of the encoding and the procedures that will be
    called to convert between this encoding and UTF-8. It is defined as
  follows:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
typedef struct Tcl_EncodingType {
        const char *<i>encodingName</i>;
        Tcl_EncodingConvertProc *<i>toUtfProc</i>;
        Tcl_EncodingConvertProc *<i>fromUtfProc</i>;
        Tcl_EncodingFreeProc *<i>freeProc</i>;
        ClientData <i>clientData</i>;
        int <i>nullSize</i>;
} Tcl_EncodingType;  
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The <i>encodingName</i> provides a string name for the encoding,
    by which it can be referred in other procedures such as
    <b>Tcl_GetEncoding</b>. The <i>toUtfProc</i> refers to a callback procedure
    to invoke to convert text from this encoding into UTF-8. The
    <i>fromUtfProc</i> refers to a callback procedure to invoke to convert text
    from UTF-8 into this encoding. The <i>freeProc</i> refers to a callback
    procedure to invoke when this encoding is deleted. The <i>freeProc</i> field
    may be NULL. The <i>clientData</i> contains an arbitrary one-word value
    passed to <i>toUtfProc</i>, <i>fromUtfProc</i>, and <i>freeProc</i> whenever
    they are called. Typically, this is a pointer to a data structure containing
    encoding-specific information that can be used by the callback procedures.
    For instance, two very similar encodings such as <b>ascii</b> and
    <b>macRoman</b> may use the same callback procedure, but use different
    values of <i>clientData</i> to control its behavior. The <i>nullSize</i>
    specifies the number of zero bytes that signify end-of-string in this
    encoding. It must be <b>1</b> (for single-byte or multi-byte encodings like
    ASCII or Shift-JIS) or <b>2</b> (for double-byte encodings like Unicode).
    Constant-sized encodings with 3 or more bytes per character (such as
    CNS11643) are not accepted.</p>
<p class="Pp">The callback procedures <i>toUtfProc</i> and <i>fromUtfProc</i>

<p class="Pp">The <i>toUtfProc</i> and <i>fromUtfProc</i> procedures are called
    by the <b>Tcl_ExternalToUtf</b> or <b>Tcl_UtfToExternal</b> family of

<h1 class="Sh" id="ENCODING_FILES"><a class="permalink" href="#ENCODING_FILES">ENCODING
  FILES</a></h1>
Space would prohibit precompiling into Tcl every possible encoding algorithm, so
  many encodings are stored on disk as dynamically-loadable encoding files. This
  behavior also allows the user to create additional encoding files that can be
  loaded using the same mechanism. These encoding files contain information
  about the tables and/or escape sequences used to map between an external
  encoding and Unicode. The external encoding may consist of single-byte,
  multi-byte, or double-byte characters.
<p class="Pp">Each dynamically-loadable encoding is represented as a text file.
    The initial line of the file, beginning with a &#x201C;#&#x201D; symbol, is
    a comment that provides a human-readable description of the file. The next
    line identifies the type of encoding file. It can be one of the following
    letters:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>[1] <b>S</b></dt>
  <dd>A single-byte encoding, where one character is always one byte long in the
      encoding. An example is <b>iso8859-1</b>, used by many European
    languages.</dd>
  <dt>[2] <b>D</b></dt>
  <dd>A double-byte encoding, where one character is always two bytes long in
      the encoding. An example is <b>big5</b>, used for Chinese text.</dd>
  <dt>[3] <b>M</b></dt>
  <dd>A multi-byte encoding, where one character may be either one or two bytes
      long. Certain bytes are lead bytes, indicating that another byte must
      follow and that together the two bytes represent one character. Other
      bytes are not lead bytes and represent themselves. An example is
      <b>shiftjis</b>, used by many Japanese computers.</dd>
  <dt>[4] <b>E</b></dt>
  <dd>An escape-sequence encoding, specifying that certain sequences of bytes do
      not represent characters, but commands that describe how following bytes
      should be interpreted.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The rest of the lines in the file depend on the type.</p>
<p class="Pp">Cases [1], [2], and [3] are collectively referred to as
    table-based encoding files. The lines in a table-based encoding file are in
    the same format as this example taken from the <b>shiftjis</b> encoding
    (this is not the complete file):</p>

<p class="Pp">The third line of the file is three numbers. The first number is
    the fallback character (in base 16) to use when converting from UTF-8 to
    this encoding. The second number is a <b>1</b> if this file represents the
    encoding for a symbol font, or <b>0</b> otherwise. The last number (in base
    10) is how many pages of data follow.</p>
<p class="Pp">Subsequent lines in the example above are pages that describe how
    to map from the encoding into 2-byte Unicode. The first line in a page
    identifies the page number. Following it are 256 double-byte numbers,
    arranged as 16 rows of 16 numbers. Given a character in the encoding, the
    high byte of that character is used to select which page, and the low byte
    of that character is used as an index to select one of the double-byte
    numbers in that page - the value obtained being the corresponding Unicode
    character. By examination of the example above, one can see that the
    characters 0x7E and 0x8163 in <b>shiftjis</b> map to 203E and 2026 in
    Unicode, respectively.</p>
<p class="Pp">Following the first page will be all the other pages, each in the
    same format as the first: one number identifying the page followed by 256
    double-byte Unicode characters. If a character in the encoding maps to the
    Unicode character 0000, it means that the character does not actually exist.
    If all characters on a page would map to 0000, that page can be omitted.</p>
<p class="Pp">Case [4] is the escape-sequence encoding file. The lines in an
    this type of file are in the same format as this example taken from the
    <b>iso2022-jp</b> encoding:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">

<p class="Pp">In the file, the first column represents an option and the second
    column is the associated value. <b>init</b> is a string to emit or expect
    before the first character is converted, while <b>final</b> is a string to
    emit or expect after the last character. All other options are names of
    table-based encodings; the associated value is the escape-sequence that
    marks that encoding. Tcl syntax is used for the values; in the above
    example, for instance, &#x201C;<b>{}</b>&#x201D; represents the empty string
    and &#x201C;<b>\x1b</b>&#x201D; represents character 27.</p>
<p class="Pp">When <b>Tcl_GetEncoding</b> encounters an encoding <i>name</i>
    that has not been loaded, it attempts to load an encoding file called
