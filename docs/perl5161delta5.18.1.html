   Set up some character translations and predefined strings.  \*(-- will
   give an unbreakable dash, \*(PI will give pi, \*(L" will give a left
   double quote, and \*(R" will give a right double quote.  \*(C+ will
   give a nicer C++.  Capital omega is used to do unbreakable dashes and
   therefore won't be available.  \*(C` and \*(C' expand to `' in nroff,
   nothing in troff, for use with C<>.

This document describes differences between the 5.16.0 release and the 5.16.1
  release.
<p class="Pp">If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.14.0, first
    read perl5160delta, which describes differences between 5.14.0 and
  5.16.0.</p>

<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>A regression introduced in Perl v5.16.0 involving
      <span class="Li">&quot;tr/</span><i>SEARCHLIST</i><span class="Li">/</span><i>REPLACEMENTLIST</i><span class="Li">/&quot;</span>
      has been fixed. Only the first instance is supposed to be meaningful if a
      character appears more than once in
      <span class="Li">&quot;</span><i>SEARCHLIST</i><span class="Li">&quot;</span>.
      Under some circumstances, the final instance was overriding all earlier
      ones. [perl #113584]</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;B::COP::stashlen&quot;</span> has been added. This
      provides access to an internal field added in perl 5.16 under threaded
      builds. It was broken at the last minute before 5.16 was released [perl
      #113034].</li>
  <li>The re pragma will no longer clobber <span class="Li">$_</span>. [perl
      #113750]</li>
  <li>Unicode 6.1 published an incorrect alias for one of the
      Canonical_Combining_Class property's values (which range between 0 and
      254). The alias <span class="Li">&quot;CCC133&quot;</span> should have
      been <span class="Li">&quot;CCC132&quot;</span>. Perl now overrides the
      data file furnished by Unicode to give the correct value.</li>
  <li>Duplicating scalar filehandles works again. [perl #113764]</li>
  <li>Under threaded perls, a runtime code block in a regular expression could
      corrupt the package name stored in the op tree, resulting in bad reads in
      <span class="Li">&quot;caller&quot;</span>, and possibly crashes [perl
      #113060].</li>
  <li>For efficiency's sake, many operators and built-in functions return the
      same scalar each time. Lvalue subroutines and subroutines in the CORE::
      namespace were allowing this implementation detail to leak through.
      <span class="Li">&quot;print &amp;CORE::uc(&quot;a&quot;),
      &amp;CORE::uc(&quot;b&quot;)&quot;</span> used to print &quot;BB&quot;.
      The same thing would happen with an lvalue subroutine returning the return
      value of <span class="Li">&quot;uc&quot;</span>. Now the value is copied
      in such cases [perl #113044].</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;__SUB__&quot;</span> now works in special blocks
      (<span class="Li">&quot;BEGIN&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;END&quot;</span>, etc.).</li>
  <li>Formats that reference lexical variables from outside no longer result in
      crashes.</li>

Perl 5.16.1 represents approximately 2 months of development since Perl 5.16.0
  and contains approximately 14,000 lines of changes across 96 files from 8
  authors.
<p class="Pp">Perl continues to flourish into its third decade thanks to a
    vibrant community of users and developers. The following people are known to
    have contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.16.1:</p>
<p class="Pp">Chris 'BinGOs' Williams, Craig A. Berry, Father Chrysostomos, Karl
    Williamson, Paul Johnson, Reini Urban, Ricardo Signes, Tony Cook.</p>
<p class="Pp">The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is
    automatically generated from version control history. In particular, it does
    not include the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who
    reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.</p>
<p class="Pp">Many of the changes included in this version originated in the
    CPAN modules included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire CPAN
    community for helping Perl to flourish.</p>
<p class="Pp">For a more complete list of all of Perl's historical contributors,
    please see the <i>AUTHORS</i> file in the Perl source distribution.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="Reporting_Bugs"><a class="permalink" href="#Reporting_Bugs">Reporting
  Bugs</a></h1>
If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
  posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
  http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ . There may also be information at
  http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.
<p class="Pp">If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug
    program included with your release. Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny
    but sufficient test case. Your bug report, along with the output of
    <span class="Li">&quot;perl -V&quot;</span>, will be sent off to
    perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make
    it inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please
    send it to perl5-security-report@perl.org. This points to a closed
    subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core
    committers, who will be able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out
    a resolution, and help co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix
    the problem across all platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use
    this address for security issues in the Perl core, not for modules
    independently distributed on CPAN.</p>
