<p class="Pp">The LDAP backend to <b>slapd</b>(8) is not an actual database;
    instead it acts as a proxy to forward incoming requests to another LDAP
    server. While processing requests it will also chase referrals, so that
    referrals are fully processed instead of being returned to the slapd
  client.</p>
<p class="Pp">Sessions that explicitly Bind to the back-ldap database always
    create their own private connection to the remote LDAP server. Anonymous
    sessions will share a single anonymous connection to the remote server. For
    sessions bound through other mechanisms, all sessions with the same DN will
    share the same connection. This connection pooling strategy can enhance the
    proxy's efficiency by reducing the overhead of repeatedly making/breaking
    multiple connections.</p>
<p class="Pp">The ldap database can also act as an information service, i.e. the
    identity of locally authenticated clients is asserted to the remote server,
    possibly in some modified form. For this purpose, the proxy binds to the
    remote server with some administrative identity, and, if required,
    authorizes the asserted identity. See the <i>idassert-</i>* rules below. The
    administrative identity of the proxy, on the remote server, must be allowed
    to authorize by means of appropriate <b>authzTo</b> rules; see
    <b>slapd.conf</b>(5) for details.</p>
<p class="Pp">The proxy instance of <b>slapd</b>(8) must contain schema
    information for the attributes and objectClasses used in filters, request DN
    and request-related data in general. It should also contain schema
    information for the data returned by the proxied server. It is the
    responsibility of the proxy administrator to keep the schema of the proxy
    lined up with that of the proxied server.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">Note: When looping back to the same instance of <b>slapd</b>(8),
    each connection requires a new thread; as a consequence, <b>slapd</b>(8)
    must be compiled with thread support, and the <b>threads</b> parameter may
    need some tuning; in those cases, one may consider using
    <b>slapd-relay</b>(5) instead, which performs the relayed operation
    internally and thus reuses the same connection.</p>

<p class="Pp">These <b>slapd.conf</b> options apply to the LDAP backend
    database. That is, they must follow a &quot;database ldap&quot; line and
    come before any subsequent &quot;backend&quot; or &quot;database&quot;
    lines. Other database options are described in the <b>slapd.conf</b>(5)

    should not be proxied, as they could be mistakenly written to the target

    sets lastmod to <b>off</b>, so its use is redundant and should be

<div class="Bd-indent">Allows to define the parameters of the authentication
  method that is internally used by the proxy to authorize connections that are
  authenticated by other databases. The identity defined by this directive,
  according to the properties associated to the authentication method, is
  supposed to have auth access on the target server to attributes used on the
  proxy for authentication and authorization, and to be allowed to authorize the
  users. This requires to have <b>proxyAuthz</b> privileges on a wide set of
  DNs, e.g. <b>authzTo=dn.subtree:&quot;&quot;</b>, and the remote server to
  have <b>authz-policy</b> set to <b>to</b> or <b>both</b>. See
  <b>slapd.conf</b>(5) for details on these statements and for remarks and
  drawbacks about their usage. The supported bindmethods are
<p class="Pp"><b>none|simple|sasl</b></p>
<p class="Pp">where <b>none</b> is the default, i.e. no <i>identity
    assertion</i> is performed.</p>
<p class="Pp">The authz parameter is used to instruct the SASL bind to exploit
    <b>native</b> SASL authorization, if available; since connections are
    cached, this should only be used when authorizing with a fixed identity
    (e.g. by means of the <b>authzDN</b> or <b>authzID</b> parameters).
    Otherwise, the default <b>proxyauthz</b> is used, i.e. the proxyAuthz
    control (Proxied Authorization, RFC 4370) is added to all operations.</p>
<p class="Pp">The supported modes are:</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>&lt;mode&gt; := {legacy|anonymous|none|self}</b></p>
<p class="Pp">If <b>&lt;mode&gt;</b> is not present, and <b>authzId</b> is
    given, the proxy always authorizes that identity. <b>&lt;authorization
    ID&gt;</b> can be</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>u:&lt;user&gt;</b></p>
<p class="Pp"><b>[dn:]&lt;DN&gt;</b></p>
<p class="Pp">The former is supposed to be expanded by the remote server
    according to the authz rules; see <b>slapd.conf</b>(5) for details. In the
    latter case, whether or not the <b>dn:</b> prefix is present, the string
    must pass DN validation and normalization.</p>
<p class="Pp">The default mode is <b>legacy</b>, which implies that the proxy
    will either perform a simple bind as the <i>authcDN</i> or a SASL bind as
    the <i>authcID</i> and assert the client's identity when it is not
    anonymous. Direct binds are always proxied. The other modes imply that the
    proxy will always either perform a simple bind as the <i>authcDN</i> or a
    SASL bind as the <i>authcID</i>, unless restricted by
    <b>idassert-authzFrom</b> rules (see below), in which case the operation
    will fail; eventually, it will assert some other identity according to
    <b>&lt;mode&gt;</b>. Other identity assertion modes are <b>anonymous</b> and
    <b>self</b>, which respectively mean that the <i>empty</i> or the
    <i>client</i>'s identity will be asserted; <b>none</b>, which means that no
    proxyAuthz control will be used, so the <i>authcDN</i> or the <i>authcID</i>
    identity will be asserted. For all modes that require the use of the
    <i>proxyAuthz</i> control, on the remote server the proxy identity must have
    appropriate <i>authzTo</i> permissions, or the asserted identities must have
    appropriate <i>authzFrom</i> permissions. Note, however, that the ID
    assertion feature is mostly useful when the asserted identities do not exist
    on the remote server.</p>
<p class="Pp">Flags can be</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>override,[non-]prescriptive,proxy-authz-[non-]critical</b></p>
<p class="Pp">When the <b>override</b> flag is used, identity assertion takes
    place even when the database is authorizing for the identity of the client,
    i.e. after binding with the provided identity, and thus authenticating it,
    the proxy performs the identity assertion using the configured identity and
    authentication method.</p>
<p class="Pp">When the <b>prescriptive</b> flag is used (the default),
    operations fail with <i>inappropriateAuthentication</i> for those identities
    whose assertion is not allowed by the <b>idassert-authzFrom</b> patterns. If
    the <b>non-prescriptive</b> flag is used, operations are performed
    anonymously for those identities whose assertion is not allowed by the
    <b>idassert-authzFrom</b> patterns.</p>
<p class="Pp">When the <b>proxy-authz-non-critical</b> flag is used (the
    default), the proxyAuthz control is not marked as critical, in violation of
    RFC 4370. Use of <b>proxy-authz-critical</b> is recommended.</p>
<p class="Pp">The TLS settings default to the same as the main slapd TLS
    settings, except for <b>tls_reqcert</b> which defaults to
    &quot;demand&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">The identity associated to this directive is also used for
    privileged operations whenever <b>idassert-bind</b> is defined and
    <b>acl-bind</b> is not. See <b>acl-bind</b> for details.</p>

  COMPATIBILITY</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The LDAP backend has been heavily reworked between releases 2.2
    and 2.3, and subsequently between 2.3 and 2.4. As a side-effect, some of the
    traditional directives have been deprecated and should be no longer used, as
    they might disappear in future releases.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="acl"><a class="permalink" href="#acl"><b>acl-authcDN
    &lt;administrative DN for access control purposes&gt;</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Formerly known as the <b>binddn</b>, it is the DN that is used to query
      the target server for acl checking; it is supposed to have read access on
      the target server to attributes used on the proxy for acl checking. There
      is no risk of giving away such values; they are only used to check
      permissions.
    <p class="Pp"><b>The acl-authcDN identity is by no means implicitly used by
        the proxy</b> <b>when the client connects anonymously.</b> The
        <b>idassert-*</b> feature can be used (at own risk) for that purpose
        instead.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This directive is obsoleted by the <b>binddn</b> arg of

  <dd>DN which is used to propagate the client's identity to the target by means
      of the proxyAuthz control when the client does not belong to the DIT
      fragment that is being proxied by back-ldap. This directive is obsoleted

  <dd>These directives are no longer supported by back-ldap; their functionality

<p class="Pp">The <b>ldap</b> backend does not honor all ACL semantics as
    described in <b>slapd.access</b>(5). In general, access checking is
    delegated to the remote server(s). Only <b>read (=r)</b> access to the

    entries returned by the <b>search</b> operation is honored, which is

<h1 class="Sh" id="OVERLAYS"><a class="permalink" href="#OVERLAYS">OVERLAYS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The LDAP backend provides basic proxying functionalities to many
    overlays. The <b>chain</b> overlay, described in <b>slapo-chain</b>(5), and
    the <b>translucent</b> overlay, described in <b>slapo-translucent</b>(5),
    deserve a special mention.</p>
<p class="Pp">Conversely, there are many overlays that are best used in
    conjunction with the LDAP backend. The <b>proxycache</b> overlay allows
    caching of LDAP search requests (queries) in a local database. See
    <b>slapo-pcache</b>(5) for details. The <b>rwm</b> overlay provides DN
    rewrite and attribute/objectClass mapping capabilities to the underlying
    database. See <b>slapo-rwm</b>(5) for details.</p>
