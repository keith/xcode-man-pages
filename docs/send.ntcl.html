   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

  	# Set up traps and other miscellaneous stuff for Tcl/Tk man pages.
  	# Start an argument description
  .b
  	# define tabbing values for .AP
  
  	# BS - start boxed text
  	# ^y = starting y location
  	# ^b = 1
  	# BE - end boxed text (draw box now)
  	Draw four-sided box normally, but don't draw top of
  	box if the box started on an earlier page.
  	# VS - start vertical sidebar
  	# ^Y = starting y location
  	# ^v = 1 (for troff;  for nroff this doesn't matter)
  	# VE - end of vertical sidebar
  	# Special macro to handle page bottom:  finish off current
  	# box/sidebar if in box/sidebar mode, then invoked standard
  	# page bottom macro.
  	Draw three-sided box if this is the box's first page,
  	draw two sides but no top otherwise.
  	# DS - begin display
  	# DE - end display
  	# SO - start of list of standard options
  	# SE - end of list of standard options
  	# OP - start of full description for a single option
  	# CS - begin code excerpt
  	# CE - end code excerpt
  	# UL - underline word
  	# QW - apply quotation marks to word
  " fix emacs highlighting
  	# PQ - apply parens and quotation marks to word
  " fix emacs highlighting
  	# QR - quoted range
  " fix emacs highlighting
  	# MT - "empty" string

This command arranges for <i>cmd</i> (and <i>arg</i>s) to be executed in the
  application named by <i>app</i>. It returns the result or error from that
  command execution. <i>App</i> may be the name of any application whose main
  window is on the display containing the sender's main window; it need not be
  within the same process. If no <i>arg</i> arguments are present, then the
  command to be executed is contained entirely within the <i>cmd</i> argument.
  If one or more <i>arg</i>s are present, they are concatenated to form the
  command to be executed, just as for the <b>eval</b> command.
<p class="Pp">If the initial arguments of the command begin with
    &#x201C;-&#x201D; they are treated as options. The following options are
    currently defined:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>-async</b></dt>
  <dd>Requests asynchronous invocation. In this case the <b>send</b> command
      will complete immediately without waiting for <i>cmd</i> to complete in
      the target application; no result will be available and errors in the sent
      command will be ignored. If the target application is in the same process
      as the sending application then the <b>-async</b> option is ignored.</dd>
  <dt><b>-displayof</b> <i>pathName</i></dt>
  <dd>Specifies that the target application's main window is on the display of
      the window given by <i>pathName</i>, instead of the display containing the
      application's main window.</dd>
  <dt><b>--</b></dt>
  <dd>Serves no purpose except to terminate the list of options. This option is
      needed only if <i>app</i> could contain a leading &#x201C;-&#x201D;
      character.

<h1 class="Sh" id="APPLICATION_NAMES"><a class="permalink" href="#APPLICATION_NAMES">APPLICATION
  NAMES</a></h1>
The name of an application is set initially from the name of the program or
  script that created the application. You can query and change the name of an
  application with the <b>tk appname</b> command.

If the <b>send</b> command is removed from an application (e.g. with the command
  <b>rename send {}</b>) then the application will not respond to incoming send
  requests anymore, nor will it be able to issue outgoing requests.
  Communication can be reenabled by invoking the <b>tk appname</b> command.
<p class="Pp"></p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="SECURITY"><a class="permalink" href="#SECURITY">SECURITY</a></h1>
The <b>send</b> command is potentially a serious security loophole. On Unix, any
  application that can connect to your X server can send scripts to your
  applications. These incoming scripts can use Tcl to read and write your files
  and invoke subprocesses under your name. Host-based access control such as
  that provided by <b>xhost</b> is particularly insecure, since it allows anyone
  with an account on particular hosts to connect to your server, and if disabled
  it allows anyone anywhere to connect to your server. In order to provide at
  least a small amount of security, Tk checks the access control being used by
  the server and rejects incoming sends unless (a) <b>xhost</b>-style access
  control is enabled (i.e. only certain hosts can establish connections) and (b)
  the list of enabled hosts is empty. This means that applications cannot
  connect to your server unless they use some other form of authorization such
  as that provide by <b>xauth</b>. Under Windows, <b>send</b> is currently
  disabled. Most of the functionality is provided by the <b>dde</b> command
  instead.

This script fragment can be used to make an application that only runs once on a
  particular display.
