This module provides a convenient way to create directories of arbitrary depth
  and to delete an entire directory subtree from the filesystem.
<p class="Pp">The following functions are provided:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>make_path( $dir1, $dir2, .... )</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>make_path( $dir1, $dir2, ...., \%opts )</dt>
  <dd>The <span class="Li">&quot;make_path&quot;</span> function creates the
      given directories if they don't exist before, much like the Unix command
      <span class="Li">&quot;mkdir -p&quot;</span>.
    <p class="Pp">The function accepts a list of directories to be created. Its
        behaviour may be tuned by an optional hashref appearing as the last
        parameter on the call.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The function returns the list of directories actually created
        during the call; in scalar context the number of directories
      created.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The following keys are recognised in the option hash:</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>mode =&gt; $num</dt>
  <dd>The numeric permissions mode to apply to each created directory (defaults
      to <span class="Li">0777</span>), to be modified by the current
      <span class="Li">&quot;umask&quot;</span>. If the directory already exists
      (and thus does not need to be created), the permissions will not be
      modified.
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;mask&quot;</span> is recognised as an
        alias for this parameter.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>chmod =&gt; $num</dt>
  <dd>Takes a numeric mode to apply to each created directory (not modified by
      the current <span class="Li">&quot;umask&quot;</span>). If the directory
      already exists (and thus does not need to be created), the permissions
      will not be modified.</dd>
  <dt>verbose =&gt; $bool</dt>
  <dd>If present, will cause <span class="Li">&quot;make_path&quot;</span> to
      print the name of each directory as it is created. By default nothing is
      printed.</dd>
  <dt>error =&gt; \$err</dt>
  <dd>If present, it should be a reference to a scalar. This scalar will be made
      to reference an array, which will be used to store any errors that are
      encountered. See the &quot;ERROR HANDLING&quot; section for more
      information.
    <p class="Pp">If this parameter is not used, certain error conditions may
        raise a fatal error that will cause the program to halt, unless trapped
        in an <span class="Li">&quot;eval&quot;</span> block.</p>

  <dd>If present, will cause any created directory to be owned by
      <span class="Li">$owner</span>. If the value is numeric, it will be
      interpreted as a uid; otherwise a username is assumed. An error will be
      issued if the username cannot be mapped to a uid, the uid does not exist
      or the process lacks the privileges to change ownership.
    <p class="Pp">Ownership of directories that already exist will not be
        changed.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;user&quot;</span> and

        <span class="Li">&quot;owner&quot;</span>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>group =&gt; $group</dt>
  <dd>If present, will cause any created directory to be owned by the group
      <span class="Li">$group</span>. If the value is numeric, it will be
      interpreted as a gid; otherwise a group name is assumed. An error will be
      issued if the group name cannot be mapped to a gid, the gid does not exist
      or the process lacks the privileges to change group ownership.

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>NOTE:</b></dt>
  <dd>The following error handling mechanism is consistent throughout all code
      paths EXCEPT in cases where the ROOT node is nonexistent. In version 2.11
      the maintainers attempted to rectify this inconsistency but too many
      downstream modules encountered problems. In such case, if you require root
      node evaluation or error checking prior to calling
      <span class="Li">&quot;make_path&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;remove_tree&quot;</span>, you should take
      additional precautions.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">If <span class="Li">&quot;make_path&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;remove_tree&quot;</span> encounters an error, a
    diagnostic message will be printed to
    <span class="Li">&quot;STDERR&quot;</span> via
    <span class="Li">&quot;carp&quot;</span> (for non-fatal errors) or via
    <span class="Li">&quot;croak&quot;</span> (for fatal errors).</p>
<p class="Pp">If this behaviour is not desirable, the
    <span class="Li">&quot;error&quot;</span> attribute may be used to hold a
    reference to a variable, which will be used to store the diagnostics. The
    variable is made a reference to an array of hash references. Each hash
    contain a single key/value pair where the key is the name of the file, and
    the value is the error message (including the contents of
    <span class="Li">$!</span> when appropriate). If a general error is
    encountered the diagnostic key will be empty.</p>
<p class="Pp">An example usage looks like:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  remove_tree( 'foo/bar', 'bar/rat', {error =&gt; \my $err} );
  if ($err &amp;&amp; @$err) {
      for my $diag (@$err) {
          my ($file, $message) = %$diag;
          if ($file eq '') {
              print &quot;general error: $message\n&quot;;
          }
          else {
              print &quot;problem unlinking $file: $message\n&quot;;
          }
      }
  }
  else {
      print &quot;No error encountered\n&quot;;
  }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Note that if no errors are encountered,
    <span class="Li">$err</span> will reference an empty array. This means that
    <span class="Li">$err</span> will always end up TRUE; so you need to test
    <span class="Li">@$err</span> to determine if errors occurred.</p>

<span class="Li">&quot;File::Path&quot;</span> blindly exports

  <span class="Li">&quot;rmtree&quot;</span> into the current namespace. These
  days, this is considered bad style, but to change it now would break too much
  code. Nonetheless, you are invited to specify what it is you are expecting to
  use:
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  use File::Path 'rmtree';
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The routines <span class="Li">&quot;make_path&quot;</span> and

    default. You must specify which ones you want to use.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  use File::Path 'remove_tree';
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Note that a side-effect of the above is that
    <span class="Li">&quot;mkpath&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;rmtree&quot;</span> are no longer exported at all.
    This is due to the way the <span class="Li">&quot;Exporter&quot;</span>
    module works. If you are migrating a codebase to use the new interface, you
    will have to list everything explicitly. But that's just good practice
    anyway.</p>

<pre>

<p class="Pp"><i>API CHANGES</i></p>
<p class="Pp">The API was changed in the 2.0 branch. For a time,
    <span class="Li">&quot;mkpath&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;rmtree&quot;</span> tried, unsuccessfully, to deal
    with the two different calling mechanisms. This approach was considered a
    failure.</p>
<p class="Pp">The new semantics are now only available with
    <span class="Li">&quot;make_path&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;remove_tree&quot;</span>. The old semantics are only
    available through <span class="Li">&quot;mkpath&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;rmtree&quot;</span>. Users are strongly encouraged to
    upgrade to at least 2.08 in order to avoid surprises.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS</i></p>
<p class="Pp">There were race conditions in the 1.x implementations of
    File::Path's <span class="Li">&quot;rmtree&quot;</span> function (although
    sometimes patched depending on the OS distribution or platform). The 2.0
    version contains code to avoid the problem mentioned in CVE-2002-0435.</p>
<p class="Pp">See the following pages for more information:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=286905
    http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2005/01/msg97623.html
    http://www.debian.org/security/2005/dsa-696
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Additionally, unless the <span class="Li">&quot;safe&quot;</span>
    parameter is set (or the third parameter in the traditional interface is
    TRUE), should a <span class="Li">&quot;remove_tree&quot;</span> be
    interrupted, files that were originally in read-only mode may now have their
    permissions set to a read-write (or &quot;delete OK&quot;) mode.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following CVE reports were previously filed against File-Path
    and are believed to have been addressed:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>&lt;http://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2004-0452&gt;</li>
  <li>&lt;http://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2005-0448&gt;</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">In February 2017 the cPanel Security Team reported an additional
    vulnerability in File-Path. The <span class="Li">&quot;chmod()&quot;</span>
    logic to make directories traversable can be abused to set the mode on an
    attacker-chosen file to an attacker-chosen value. This is due to the
    time-of-check-to-time-of-use (TOCTTOU) race condition
    (&lt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_of_check_to_time_of_use&gt;) between
    the <span class="Li">&quot;stat()&quot;</span> that decides the inode is a
    directory and the <span class="Li">&quot;chmod()&quot;</span> that tries to
    make it user-rwx. CPAN versions 2.13 and later incorporate a patch provided
    by John Lightsey to address this problem. This vulnerability has been
    reported as CVE-2017-6512.</p>

  <dd><span class="Li">&quot;remove_tree&quot;</span>, after having deleted

  <dd><span class="Li">&quot;remove_tree&quot;</span>, after having deleted

  <dd><span class="Li">&quot;remove_tree&quot;</span> was unable to stat the

  <dd>Just before removing a directory (after having successfully removed

      possibly not be deleted.</dd>
  <dt>cannot remove directory [dir]: [errmsg]</dt>
  <dd><span class="Li">&quot;remove_tree&quot;</span> attempted to remove a
      directory, but failed. This may be because some objects that were unable
      to be removed remain in the directory, or it could be a permissions issue.
      The directory will be left behind.</dd>

  <dd><span class="Li">&quot;remove_tree&quot;</span> attempted to force the

  <li>File::Remove
    <p class="Pp">Allows files and directories to be moved to the
        Trashcan/Recycle Bin (where they may later be restored if necessary) if
        the operating system supports such functionality. This feature may one

  <li>File::Find::Rule
    <p class="Pp">When removing directory trees, if you want to examine each
        file to decide whether to delete it (and possibly leaving large swathes

<i>File::Path</i> <span class="Li">&quot;rmtree&quot;</span> and
  <span class="Li">&quot;remove_tree&quot;</span> will not work with
  multithreaded applications due to its use of
  <span class="Li">&quot;chdir&quot;</span>. At this time, no warning or error
  is generated in this situation. You will certainly encounter unexpected
  results.
<p class="Pp">The implementation that surfaces this limitation will not be
    changed. See the <i>File::Path::Tiny</i> module for functionality similar to
    <i>File::Path</i> but which does not
    <span class="Li">&quot;chdir&quot;</span>.</p>

  Mount Points</a></h2>
<i>File::Path</i> is not responsible for triggering the automounts, mirror
  mounts, and the contents of network mounted filesystems. If your NFS
  implementation requires an action to be performed on the filesystem in order
  for <i>File::Path</i> to perform operations, it is strongly suggested you
  assure filesystem availability by reading the root of the mounted filesystem.

Paul Szabo identified the race condition originally, and Brendan O'Dea wrote an
  implementation for Debian that addressed the problem. That code was used as a
  basis for the current code. Their efforts are greatly appreciated.
<p class="Pp">Gisle Aas made a number of improvements to the documentation for
    2.07 and his advice and assistance is also greatly appreciated.</p>
