<p class="Pp"><i>strip</i> removes or modifies the symbol table attached to the
    output of the assembler and link editor. This is useful to save space after
    a program has been debugged and to limit dynamically bound symbols.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>strip</i> no longer removes relocation entries under any
    condition. Instead, it updates the external relocation entries (and indirect
    symbol table entries) to reflect the resulting symbol table. <i>strip</i>
    prints an error message for those symbols not in the resulting symbol table
    that are needed by an external relocation entry or an indirect symbol table.
    The link editor <i>ld</i>(1) is the only program that can strip relocation
    entries and know if it is safe to do so.</p>
<p class="Pp">When <i>strip</i> is used with no options on an executable file,
    it checks that file to see if it uses the dynamic link editor. If it does,
    the effect of the <i>strip</i> command is the same as using the <b>-u</b>
    and <b>-r</b> options. If the file does not use the dynamic link editor
    (e.g. -preload or -static), the effect of <i>strip</i> without any options
    is to completely remove the symbol table. The options <b>-S,</b> <b>-x,</b>
    and <b>-X</b> have the same effect as the <i>ld</i>(1) options. The options
    to <i>strip</i>(1) can be combined to trim the symbol table to just what is
    desired.</p>
<p class="Pp">You should trim the symbol table of files used with dynamic
    linking so that only those symbols intended to be external interfaces are
    saved. Files used with dynamic linking include executables, objects that are
    loaded (usually bundles), and dynamic shared libraries. Only global symbols
    are used by the dynamic linking process. You should strip all non-global
    symbols.</p>
<p class="Pp">When an executable is built with all its dependent dynamic shared
    libraries, it is typically stripped with:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">% strip -u -r executable</div>
which saves all undefined symbols (usually defined in the dynamic shared
  libraries) and all global symbols defined in the executable referenced by the
  dynamic libraries (as marked by the static link editor when the executable was
  built). This is the maximum level of striping for an executable that will
  still allow the program to run correctly with its libraries.
<p class="Pp">If the executable loads objects, however, the global symbols that
    the objects reference from the executable also must not be stripped. In this
    case, when linking the executable you should use the
    `-exported_symbols_list` option of the link editor <i>ld</i>(1) to limit
    which symbols can be referenced by the objects. Then you only need to strip
    local and debug symbols, like that:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">% strip -x -S executable</div>
<p class="Pp">For objects that will be loaded into an executable, you should
    trim the symbol table to limit the global symbols the executable will see.
    This would be done with:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>% strip -s interface_symbols -u object</pre>
</div>
which would leave only the undefined symbols and symbols listed in the file
  <i>interface_symbols</i> in the object file. In this case, <i>strip</i>(1) has
  updated the relocation entries and indirect symbol table to reflect the new
  symbol table.
<p class="Pp">For dynamic shared libraries, the maximum level of stripping is
    usually <b>-x</b> (to remove all non-global symbols).</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="STRIPPING_FILES_FOR_USE_WITH_RUNTIME_LOADED_CODE"><a class="permalink" href="#STRIPPING_FILES_FOR_USE_WITH_RUNTIME_LOADED_CODE">STRIPPING
  FILES FOR USE WITH RUNTIME LOADED CODE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Trimming the symbol table for programs that load code at runtime
    allows you to control the interface that the executable wants to provide to
    the objects that it will load; it will not have to publish symbols that are
    not part of its interface. For example, an executable that wishes to allow
    only a subset of its global symbols but all of the statically linked shared
    library's globals to be used would be stripped with:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">% strip -s interface_symbols -A executable</div>
where the file <i>interface_symbols</i> would contain only those symbols from
  the executable that it wishes the code loaded at runtime to have access to.
  Another example is an object that is made up of a number of other objects that
  will be loaded into an executable would built and then stripped with:
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>% ld -o relocatable.o -r a.o b.o c.o
% strip -s interface_symbols -u relocatable.o</pre>
</div>
which would leave only the undefined symbols and symbols listed in the file
  <i>interface_symbols</i> in the object file. In this case <i>strip</i>(1) has
  updated the relocation entries to reflect the new symbol table.

<p class="Pp">The first set of options indicate symbols that are to be saved in
    the resulting output file.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="u"><a class="permalink" href="#u"><b>-u</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Save all undefined symbols. This is intended for use with relocatable
      objects to save symbols referred to by external relocation entries. Note
      that common symbols are also referred to by external relocation entries
      and this flag does not save those symbols.</dd>
  <dt id="r"><a class="permalink" href="#r"><b>-r</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Save all symbols referenced dynamically.</dd>
  <dt id="s"><a class="permalink" href="#s"><b>-s</b><i> filename</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Save the symbol table entries for the global symbols listed in
      <i>filename.</i> The symbol names listed in <i>filename</i> must be one
      per line. Leading and trailing white space are not part of the symbol
      name. Lines starting with # are ignored, as are lines with only white
      space.</dd>
  <dt id="R"><a class="permalink" href="#R"><b>-R</b><i> filename</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Remove the symbol table entries for the global symbols listed in
      <i>filename.</i> This file has the same format as the <b>-s</b>
      <i>filename</i> option above. This option is usually used in combination
      with other options that save some symbols, <b>-S,</b> <b>-x,</b> etc.</dd>
  <dt id="i"><a class="permalink" href="#i"><b>-i</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Ignore symbols listed in the <b>-s</b> <i>filename</i> or <b>-R</b>
      <i>filename</i> options that are not in the files to be stripped (this is
      normally an error).</dd>
  <dt id="d"><a class="permalink" href="#d"><b>-d</b><i> filename</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Save the debugging symbol table entries for each source file name listed
      in <i>filename.</i> The source file names listed in <i>filename</i> must
      be one per line with no other white space in the file except the newlines
      on the end of each line. And they must be just the base name of the source
      file without any leading directories. This option works only with the
      <i>stab</i>(5) debugging format, it has no affect when using the DWARF
      debugging format.</dd>
  <dt id="A"><a class="permalink" href="#A"><b>-A</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Save all global absolute symbols except those with a value of zero, and
      save Objective C class symbols. This is intended for use of programs that
      load code at runtime and want the loaded code to use symbols from the
      shared libraries (this is only used with <small>NEXTSTEP</small> 3.3 and
      earlier releases).</dd>
  <dt id="n"><a class="permalink" href="#n"><b>-n</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Save all N_SECT global symbols. This is intended for use with executable
      programs in combination with <b>-A</b> to remove the symbols needed for
      correct static link editing which are not needed for use with runtime
      loading interfaces where using the <b>-s</b><i> filename</i> would be too
      much trouble (this is only used with <small>NEXTSTEP</small> 3.3 and
      earlier releases).</dd>

      option to <i>cc</i>(1) and other compilers).</dd>
  <dt id="X"><a class="permalink" href="#X"><b>-X</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Remove the local symbols whose names begin with `L'.</dd>
  <dt id="T"><a class="permalink" href="#T"><b>-T</b></a></dt>
  <dd>The intent of this flag is to remove Swift symbols from the Mach-O symbol
      table, It removes the symbols whose names begin with `_$S' or `_$s' only
      when it finds an __objc_imageinfo section with and it has a non-zero swift
      version. The future the implementation of this flag may change to match
      the intent. When used together with <b>-R,/</b> <b>-s</b> files the Swift
      symbols will also be removed from global symbol lists used by dyld.</dd>
  <dt id="N"><a class="permalink" href="#N"><b>-N</b></a></dt>
  <dd>In binaries that use the dynamic linker remove all nlist symbols and the
      string table. Setting the environment variable STRIP_NLISTS has the same
      effect.</dd>
  <dt id="x"><a class="permalink" href="#x"><b>-x</b></a></dt>
