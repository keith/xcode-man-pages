Parse::Eyapp::debuggingtut - Solving ambiguities and fixing lexical, syntactic
  and semantic errors
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="INTRODUCTION"><a class="permalink" href="#INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</a></h1>
The sources of error when programming with
  <span class="Li">&quot;eyapp&quot;</span> are many and various. Some of them
  are minor, as having a nonterminal without production rules or a terminal that
  is never produced by the lexical analyzer. These kind of errors can be caught
  with the help of the <span class="Li">%strict</span> directive.
<p class="Pp">In the following sections we will discuss three main kind of
    errors that correspond to three development stages:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Conflict errors:
    <p class="Pp">Conflicts with the grammar: the grammar is ambiguous or is not
        clear - perhaps due to the fact that
        <span class="Li">&quot;eyapp&quot;</span> uses only a lookahead symbol -
        which sort of tree must be built for some inputs</p>
  </li>
  <li>Tree building errors:
    <p class="Pp">There are no conflicts but the parser does not build the
        syntax tree as expected. May be it rejects correct sentences or accepts
        incorrect ones. Or may be it accepts correct ones but the syntax tree
        has not the shape we want (i.e. we have a precedence problem).</p>
  </li>
  <li>Semantic errors:
    <p class="Pp">We have solved the conflicts and trees are satisfactory but we
        have errors inside the semantic actions.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">Each time you discover an error write a test that covers that
    error. Section &quot;TREE EQUALITY&quot; deals with the problem of checking
    if the generated abstract syntax tree has the correct shape and
  attributes.</p>
<p class="Pp">As Andreas Zeller points out in his article &quot;Beautiful
    Debugging&quot; finding the causes of a failing program must follow the
    scientific method:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>1. Observe the failure (there are conflicts or ambiguity, there are
    precedence problems, there are semantic errors, the output is wrong)</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>2. Guess a hypothesis for the failure (if necessary use &quot;eyapp&quot;
    &quot;-v&quot; option, &quot;yydebug&quot;, the Perl debugger, etc. to build
    the hypothesis). If you use continuous testing it is likely related with the
    recently written code.</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>3. Based on your hypothesis make predictions</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>3. Using appropriate input tests and the available tools
    (&quot;eyapp&quot; &quot;-v&quot; option, &quot;yydebug&quot;, the Perl
    debugger, etc.) see if your predictions hold. Reject your hypothesis if they
    don't hold.</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>4. Repeat the last two steps until your hypothesis is confirmed. The
    hypothesis then becomes a theory.</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>5. Convert the knowledge and informal tests developed during this process
    in a formal test that covers the failure</dt>
  <dd></dd>

By default, identifiers appearing in the rule section will be classified as
  terminal if they don't appear in the left hand side of any production rules.
<p class="Pp">The directive <span class="Li">%strict</span> forces the
    declaration of all tokens. The following
    <span class="Li">&quot;eyapp&quot;</span> program issues a warning:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Understanding_Priorities"><a class="permalink" href="#Understanding_Priorities">Understanding
  Priorities</a></h2>
Token and production priorities are used to solve conflicts. Recall the main
  points of yacc-like parsers related to priorities:
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>The directives
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
            %left
            %right
            %nonassoc
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">can be used in the head section to declare the priority of a
        token</p>
  </li>
  <li>The later the declaration line the higher the priority</li>
  <li>The precedence of a production rule (right hand side) is the precedence of
      the last token in the right hand side</li>
  <li>In a shift-reduce conflict the default action is to shift. This action can
      be changed if the production and the token have explicit priorities</li>
  <li>If the precedence of the production rule is higher the shift-reduce
      conflict is solved in favor of the reduction</li>
  <li>If the precedence of the token is higher the shift-reduce conflict is
      solved in favor of the shift</li>
  <li>If the precedence of the token is the same than the precedence of the
      rule, and is left the shift-reduce conflict is solved in favor of the
      reduction</li>
  <li>If the precedence of the token is the same than the precedence of the
      rule, and is right the shift-reduce conflict is solved in favor of the
      shift</li>
  <li>If the precedence of the token is the same than the precedence of the
      rule, and is nonassoc the presence of a shift-reduce conflict means an
      error. This is used to describe operators, like the operator
      <span class="Li">&quot;.LT.&quot;</span> in FORTRAN, that may not
      associate with themselves. That is, because
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
                             A .LT. B .LT. C
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">is invalid in FORTRAN,
        <span class="Li">&quot;.LT.&quot;</span> would be described with the
        keyword <span class="Li">%nonassoc</span> in eyapp.</p>
  </li>
  <li>The default precedence of a production can be changed using the
      <span class="Li">&quot;%prec TOKEN&quot;</span> directive. Now the rule
      has the precedence and associativity of the specified
      <span class="Li">&quot;TOKEN&quot;</span>.</li>
</ul>

<p class="Pp">An state is a set of production rules with a marker (the dot in
    rules 3 and 4) somewhere in its right hand side. If the parser is in state 4
    is because the production rules <span class="Li">&quot;ds -&gt; D ';'
    ds&quot;</span> and <span class="Li">&quot;ds -&gt; D&quot;</span> are
    potential candidates to build the syntax tree. That they will win or not
    depends on what will happen next when more input is processed.</p>
<p class="Pp">The dot that appears on the right hand side means <i>position</i>
    in our guessing. The fact that <span class="Li">&quot;ds -&gt; D .';'
    ds&quot;</span> is in state 4 means that if the parser is in state 4 we have
    already seen <span class="Li">&quot;D&quot;</span> and we expect to see a
    semicolon followed by <span class="Li">&quot;ds&quot;</span> (or something
    derivable from <span class="Li">&quot;ds&quot;</span>). If such thing
    happens this production will be the right one (will be the <i>handle</i> in
    the jargon). The comment</p>

</pre>
<p class="Pp">As we see state 8 has the item <span class="Li">&quot;ds -&gt; D
    ';' . ds&quot;</span> which means that we have already seen a
    <span class="Li">&quot;D&quot;</span> and a semicolon.</p>
<p class="Pp">The fact that <span class="Li">&quot;ds -&gt; D .&quot;</span> is
    in state 4 means that we have already seen
    <span class="Li">&quot;D&quot;</span> and since the dot is at the end of the
    rule, this production can be the right one, even if a semicolon is just
    waiting in the input. An example that it will be correct to
    &quot;reduce&quot; by the rule <span class="Li">&quot;ds -&gt; D
    .&quot;</span> in the presence of a semicolon is given by the input
    <span class="Li">&quot;D ; S&quot;</span>. A rightmost derivation for such
    input is:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  p =&gt; ds ; ss =&gt; ds ; S =&gt; D ; S
</pre>
<p class="Pp">that is processed by the <i>LALR</i>(1) algorithm following this

<p class="Pp">Since it is correct to reduce in some cases by the production
    <span class="Li">&quot;ds -&gt; D .&quot;</span> and others in which is
    correct to shift the semicolon, <span class="Li">&quot;eyapp&quot;</span>
    complains about a shift/reduce conflict with <span class="Li">';'</span>.
    State 4 has two rules that compete to be the right one:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>

  1 shift/reduce conflict (see .output file)
</pre>
<p class="Pp">We can guess that the right item (the rules with the dot, i.e. the
    states of the automaton are called <i>LALR</i>(0) items in the yacc jargon)
    is <span class="Li">&quot;ds -&gt; D .';' ds&quot;</span> and <i>shift to
    state 8</i> consuming the semicolon, expecting to see something derivable
    from <span class="Li">&quot;ds&quot;</span> later or guess that
    <span class="Li">&quot;ds -&gt; D .&quot;</span> is the right <i>LR</i>(0)
    item and <i>reduce</i> for such rule. This is the meaning of the comments in
    state 4:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    60          ';'     shift, and go to state 8
    61
    62          ';'     [reduce using rule 4 (ds)]
</pre>
<p class="Pp">To illustrate the problem let us consider the phrases
    <span class="Li">&quot;D;S&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;D;D;S&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">For both phrases, after consuming the
    <span class="Li">&quot;D&quot;</span> the parser will go to state 4 and the
    current token will be the semicolon.</p>
<p class="Pp">For the first phrase <span class="Li">&quot;D;S&quot;</span> the
    correct decision is to use rule 4 <span class="Li">&quot;ds -&gt;
    D&quot;</span> (to <i>reduce</i> in the jargon). For the second phrase
    <span class="Li">&quot;D;D;S&quot;</span> the correct decision is to follow
    rule 3 <span class="Li">&quot;ds -&gt; D . ';' ds&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The parser generated by <span class="Li">&quot;eyapp&quot;</span>
    would be able to know which rule is correct for each case if it were allowed
    to look at the token after the semicolon: if it is a
    <span class="Li">&quot;S&quot;</span> is rule 4, if it is a
    <span class="Li">&quot;D&quot;</span> is rule 3. But the parsers generated
    by <span class="Li">&quot;Eyapp&quot;</span> do not lookahead more than the
    next token (this is what the &quot;1&quot; means when we say that
    <span class="Li">&quot;Parse::Eyapp&quot;</span> parsers are <i>LALR</i>(1))
    and therefore is not in condition to decide which production rule
  applies.</p>
<p class="Pp">Unfortunately this is the sort of conflict that can't be solved by
    assigning priorities to the productions and tokens as it was done for the
    calculator example in Parse::Eyapp::eyappintro. If we run the analyzer it
    will refuse to accept correct entries like
    <span class="Li">&quot;D;D;S&quot;</span>:</p>

The problem here is that <span class="Li">&quot;Eyapp/Yapp/Yacc&quot;</span>
  etc. produce <i>LALR</i>(1) parsers. They only look the next token. We can
  decide how to solve the conflict by rewriting the lexical analyzer to peer
  forward what token comes after the semicolon: it now returns
  <span class="Li">&quot;SEMICOLONS&quot;</span> if it is an
  <span class="Li">&quot;S&quot;</span> and
  <span class="Li">&quot;SEMICOLOND&quot;</span> if it is an

  LR PARSING ALGORITHM: UNDERSTANDING THE OUTPUT OF &quot;yydebug&quot;</a></h1>
The <span class="Li">&quot;YYParse&quot;</span> methods implements the generic
  LR parsing algorithm. It very much works
  <span class="Li">&quot;Parse::Yapp::YYParse&quot;</span> and as yacc/bison
  <span class="Li">&quot;yyparse&quot;</span>. It accepts almost the same
  arguments as <span class="Li">&quot;Class-&gt;new&quot;</span> (Being
  <span class="Li">&quot;Class&quot;</span> the name of the generated class).
<p class="Pp">The parser uses two tables and a stack. The two tables are called
    the <i>action</i> table and the <i>goto</i> table. The stack is used to keep
    track of the states visited.</p>
<p class="Pp">At each step the generated parser consults the
    <span class="Li">&quot;action&quot;</span> table and takes one decision: To
    shift to a new state consuming one token (and pushing the current state in
    the stack) or to reduce by some production rule. In the last case the parser
    pops from its stack as many states as symbols are on the right hand side of
    the production rule. Here is a Perl/C like pseudocode summarizing the
    activity of <span class="Li">&quot;YYParse&quot;</span>:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
     1   my $parser = shift; # The parser object
     2   push(@stack, $parser-&gt;{startstate});
     3   $b = $parser-&gt;YYLexer(); # Get the first token
     4   FOREVER: {
     5     $s = top(0);  # Get the state on top of the stack
     6     $a = $b;
     7     switch ($parser-&gt;action[$s-&gt;state][$a]) {
     8       case &quot;shift t&quot; : 
     9         my $t;
    10         $t-&gt;{state} = t;
    11         $t-&gt;{attr}  = $a-&gt;{attr};
    12         push($t); 
    13         $b = $parser-&gt;YYLexer(); # Call the lexical analyzer
    14         break;
    15       case &quot;reduce A-&gt;alpha&quot; : 
    16         # Call the semantic action with the attributes of the rhs as args
    17         my $semantic  = $parser-&gt;Semantic{A -&gt;alpha}; # The semantic action
    18         my $r;
    19         $r-&gt;{attr} = $semantic-&gt;($parser, top(|alpha|-1)-&gt;attr, ... , top(0)-&gt;attr); 
    20  
    21         # Pop as many states as symbols on the rhs of A-&gt;alpha
    22         pop(|alpha|);  
    23  
    24         # Goto next state 
    25         $r-&gt;{state} = $parser-&gt;goto[top(0)][A]; 
    26         push($r); 
    27         break;

    32   }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Here <span class="Li">&quot;|alpha|&quot;</span> stands for the
    length of <span class="Li">&quot;alpha&quot;</span>. Function
    <span class="Li">top(k)</span> returns the state in position
    <span class="Li">&quot;k&quot;</span> from the top of the stack, i.e. the
    state at depth <span class="Li">&quot;k&quot;</span>. Function
    <span class="Li">pop(k)</span> extracts
    <span class="Li">&quot;k&quot;</span> states from the stack. The call
    <span class="Li">&quot;$state-&gt;attr&quot;</span> returns the attribute
    associated with <span class="Li">$state</span>. The call

</pre>
<p class="Pp">The original language standard allows only numeric literals and
    constant identifiers for the subrange bounds (`lo' and `hi'), but Extended
    Pascal and many other Pascal implementations allow arbitrary expressions
    there. This gives rise to the following situation, containing a superfluous
    pair of parentheses:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
     type subrange = (a) .. b;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Compare this to the following declaration of an enumerated type

</pre>
<p class="Pp">These two declarations look identical until the
    <span class="Li">&quot;..&quot;</span> token. With normal <i>LALR</i>(1)
    one-token look-ahead it is not possible to decide between the two forms when
    the identifier <span class="Li">&quot;a&quot;</span> is parsed. It is,
    however, desirable for a parser to decide this, since in the latter case
    <span class="Li">&quot;a&quot;</span> must become a new identifier to
    represent the enumeration value, while in the former case
    <span class="Li">&quot;a&quot;</span> must be evaluated with its current
    meaning, which may be a constant or even a function call.</p>
<p class="Pp">The consequence is a reduce-reduce conflict, which is summarized
    in this state of the LALR automata:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>

    ')' reduce using rule 4 (id_list)
    ',' reduce using rule 4 (id_list)
    $default    reduce using rule 11 (expr)
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The grammar in file
    <span class="Li">&quot;pascalenumeratedvsrangesolvedvialex.eyp&quot;</span>
    solves this particular problem by looking ahead in the lexical analyzer: if
    the parenthesis is followed by a sequence of comma separated identifiers
    finished by the closing parenthesis and a semicolon we can conclude that is
    a enumerated type declaration. For more details, have a look at the file.

  DEPENDING ON THE SYNTACTIC CONTEXT</a></h1>
Usually there is a one-to-one relation between a token and a regexp. Problems
  arise, however when a token's type depends upon contextual information. An
  example of this problem comes from PL/I, where statements like this are legal:
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
         if then=if then if=then
</pre>
<p class="Pp">In PL/I this problem arises because keywords like
    <span class="Li">&quot;if&quot;</span> are not reserved and can be used in
    other contexts. This simplified grammar illustrates the problem:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  examples/debuggingtut$ eyapp -c PL_I_conflict.eyp
  # This grammar deals with the famous ambiguous PL/I phrase:
  #                if then=if then if=then
  # The (partial) solution uses YYExpect in the lexical analyzer to predict the token
  # that fulfills the parser expectatives.
  # Compile it with:
  # eyapp -b '' PL_I_conflict.eyp
  # Run it with;
  # ./PL_I_conflict.pm -debug
  %strict
  %token ID
  %tree bypass

  %%

  stmt:
        ifstmt
      | assignstmt
  ;
  # Exercise: change this production
  #     for 'if' expr 'then' stmt
  # and check with input 'if then=if then if=then'. The problem arises again
  ifstmt:
        %name IF
        'if' expr 'then' expr
  ;
  assignstmt:
        id '=' expr
  ;
  expr:
        %name EQ
        id '=' id
      | id
  ;
  id:
        %name ID

</pre>
<p class="Pp">If the token ambiguity depends only in the syntactic context, the
    problem can be alleviated using the
    <span class="Li">&quot;YYExpect&quot;</span> method. In case of doubt, the
    lexical analyzer calls the <span class="Li">&quot;YYExpect&quot;</span>
    method to know which of the several feasible tokens is expected by the
    parser:</p>

A <i>lexical tie-in</i> is a flag which is set to alter the behavior of the

<h2 class="Ss" id="The_Parsing_of__C_"><a class="permalink" href="#The_Parsing_of__C_">The
  Parsing of &quot;C&quot;</a></h2>
The C language has a context dependency: the way an identifier is used depends
  on what its current meaning is. For example, consider this:
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  T(x);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This looks like a function call statement, but if
    <span class="Li">&quot;T&quot;</span> is a typedef name, then this is
    actually a declaration of <span class="Li">&quot;x&quot;</span>. How can a
    parser for C decide how to parse this input?</p>
<p class="Pp">Here is another example:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  {
    T * x;
    ...
  }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">What is this, a declaration of
    <span class="Li">&quot;x&quot;</span> as a pointer to
    <span class="Li">&quot;T&quot;</span>, or a void multiplication of the
    variables <span class="Li">&quot;T&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;x&quot;</span>?</p>
<p class="Pp">The usual method to solve this problem is to have two different
    token types, <span class="Li">&quot;ID&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;TYPENAME&quot;</span>. When the lexical analyzer
    finds an identifier, it looks up in the symbol table the current declaration
    of the identifier in order to decide which token type to return:
    <span class="Li">&quot;TYPENAME&quot;</span> if the identifier is declared
    as a typedef, <span class="Li">&quot;ID&quot;</span> otherwise. See the ANSI
    C parser example in the directory
    <span class="Li">&quot;examples/languages/C/ansic.eyp&quot;</span></p>

  Simple Example</a></h2>
In the &quot;Calc&quot;-like example in
  <span class="Li">&quot;examples/debuggintut/SemanticInfoInTokens.eyp&quot;</span>
  we have a language with a special construct <span class="Li">&quot;hex
  (hex-expr)&quot;</span>. After the keyword
  <span class="Li">&quot;hex&quot;</span> comes an
  <span class="Li">&quot;expression&quot;</span> in parentheses in which all
  integers are hexadecimal. In particular, strings in
  <span class="Li">&quot;/[A-F0-9]+/&quot;</span> like
  <span class="Li">&quot;A1B&quot;</span> must be treated as an hex integer
  unless they were previously declared as variables. Let us see an example of
  execution:
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  $ eyapp -b '' SemanticInfoInTokens.eyp
  $ cat inputforsemanticinfo2.txt
  int A2
  A2 = HEX(A23);
  A2 = HEX(A2)

  $ ./SemanticInfoInTokens.pm -f inputforsemanticinfo2.txt  -t
  EXPS(ASSIGN(TERMINAL[A2],NUM[2595]),ASSIGN(TERMINAL[A2],ID[A2]))
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The first hex expression
    <span class="Li">&quot;HEX(A23)&quot;</span> is interpreted as the number
    <span class="Li">2595</span> while the second
    <span class="Li">&quot;HEX(A2)&quot;</span> refers to previously declared
    variable <span class="Li">&quot;A2&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">An alternative solution to this problem that does not make use of
    lexical tie-ins - but still uses an attribute
    <span class="Li">&quot;HEXFLAG&quot;</span> for communication between
    different semantic actions - can be found in the file
    <span class="Li">&quot;examples/debuggintut/Tieins.eyp&quot;</span>.</p>

  CONFLICTS WITH THE <i>POSTPONED CONFLICT</i> STRATEGY</a></h1>
Yacc-like parser generators provide ways to solve shift-reduce mechanims based
  on token precedence. No mechanisms are provided for the resolution of
  reduce-reduce conflicts. The solution for such kind of conflicts is to modify
  the grammar. The strategy We present here provides a way to broach conflicts
  that can't be solved using static precedences.

  <i>Postponed Conflict Resolution</i> Strategy</a></h2>
The <i>postponed conflict strategy</i> presented here can be used whenever there
  is a shift-reduce or reduce-reduce conflict that can not be solved using
  static precedences.

  Conflict Resolution</i>: Reduce-Reduce Conflicts</a></h2>
Let us assume we have a reduce-reduce conflict between to productions
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
                      A -&gt; alpha .
                      B -&gt; beta .
</pre>
<p class="Pp">for some token <span class="Li">&quot;@&quot;</span>. Let also
    assume that production</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
                      A -&gt; alpha
</pre>
<p class="Pp">has name <span class="Li">&quot;ruleA&quot;</span> and
  production</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
                      B -&gt; beta
</pre>
<p class="Pp">has name <span class="Li">&quot;ruleB&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The postponed conflict resolution strategy consists in modifying
    the conflictive grammar by marking the points where the conflict occurs with
    the new <span class="Li">%PREC</span> directive. In this case at then end of
    the involved productions:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
                      A -&gt; alpha %PREC IsAorB 
                      B -&gt; beta  $PREC IsAorB
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;IsAorB&quot;</span> identifier is
    called the <i>conflict name</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Inside the head section, the programmer associates with the
    conflict name a code whose mission is to solve the conflict by dynamically
    changing the parsing table like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
                     %conflict IsAorB {
                          my $self = shift;

                          if (looks_like_A($self)) {
                            $self-&gt;YYSetReduce('@', 'ruleA' );
                          }
                          else {
                            $self-&gt;YYSetReduce('@', 'ruleB' );
                          }
                       }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The code associated with the <i>conflict name</i> receives the
    name of <i> conflict handler</i>. The code of
    <span class="Li">&quot;looks_like_A&quot;</span> stands for some form of
    nested parsing which will decide which production applies.</p>

  Two trees are considered equal if their root nodes belong to the same class,
  they have the same number of children and the children are (recursively)

  &quot;equal&quot; During Testing</a></h2>
During the development of your compiler you add new stages to the existing ones.
  The consequence is that the AST is decorated with new attributes.
  Unfortunately, this implies that tests you wrote using
  <span class="Li">&quot;is_deeply&quot;</span> and comparisons against formerly
  correct abstract syntax trees are no longer valid. This is due to the fact
  that <span class="Li">&quot;is_deeply&quot;</span> requires both tree
  structures to be equivalent in every detail and that our new code produces a
  tree with new attributes.
<p class="Pp">Instead of <span class="Li">&quot;is_deeply&quot;</span> use the
    <span class="Li">&quot;equal&quot;</span> method to check for partial
    equivalence between abstract syntax trees. You can follow these steps:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Dump the tree for the source inserting
      <span class="Li">&quot;Data::Dumper&quot;</span> statements</li>
  <li>Carefully check that the tree is really correct</li>
  <li>Decide which attributes will be used for comparison</li>
  <li>Write the code for the expected value editing the output produced by
      <span class="Li">&quot;Data::Dumper&quot;</span></li>
  <li>Write the handlers for the attributes you decided. Write the comparison
      using <span class="Li">&quot;equal&quot;</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">Tests using this methodology will not fail even if later code
    decorating the AST with new attributes is introduced.</p>
<p class="Pp">See an example that checks an abstract syntax tree produced by the
    simple compiler (see
    <span class="Li">&quot;examples/typechecking/Simple-Types-XXX.tar.gz&quot;</span>)
    for a really simple source:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  Simple-Types/script$ cat prueba27.c
  int f() {
  }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The first thing is to obtain a description of the tree, that can
    be done executing the compiler under the control of the Perl debugger,
    stopping just after the tree has been built and dumping the tree with
    Data::Dumper:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  pl@nereida:~/Lbook/code/Simple-Types/script$ perl -wd usetypes.pl prueba27.c
  main::(usetypes.pl:5):  my $filename = shift || die &quot;Usage:\n$0 file.c\n&quot;;
    DB&lt;1&gt; c 12
  main::(usetypes.pl:12): Simple::Types::show_trees($t, $debug);
    DB&lt;2&gt; use Data::Dumper
    DB&lt;3&gt; $Data::Dumper::Purity = 1
    DB&lt;4&gt; p Dumper($t)
  $VAR1 = bless( {
                   ..............................................
                 }, 'PROGRAM' );
  ...............................................................
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Once we have the shape of a correct tree we can write our
  tests:</p>

I use these rules for indenting Parse::Eyapp programs:
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Use uppercase identifiers for tokens, lowercase identifiers for syntactic
      variables</li>
  <li>The syntactic variable that defines the rule must be at in a single line

    <p class="Pp">The separation bar <span class="Li">&quot;|&quot;</span> goes
        indented relative to the left side of the rule. Each production starts
        two spaces from the bar. The first right hand side is aligned with the
        rest.</p>
  </li>
  <li>The semicolon <span class="Li">&quot;;&quot;</span> must also be in its
      own line at column 0</li>
  <li>If there is an empty production it must be the first one and must be

    who have contributed to improve the module (see &quot;CONTRIBUTORS&quot; in
    Parse::Eyapp). Thanks to Larry Wall for giving us Perl. Special thanks to
    Juana.</p>
