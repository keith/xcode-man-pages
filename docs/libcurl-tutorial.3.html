<p class="Pp">This document attempts to describe the general principles and some
    basic approaches to consider when programming with libcurl. The text will
    focus mainly on the C interface but might apply fairly well on other
    interfaces as well as they usually follow the C one pretty closely.</p>
<p class="Pp">This document will refer to 'the user' as the person writing the
    source code that uses libcurl. That would probably be you or someone in your
    position. What will be generally referred to as 'the program' will be the
    collected source code that you write that is using libcurl for transfers.
    The program is outside libcurl and libcurl is outside of the program.</p>
<p class="Pp">To get more details on all options and functions described herein,
    please refer to their respective man pages.</p>

<p class="Pp">There are many different ways to build C programs. This chapter
    will assume a Unix style build process. If you use a different build system,
    you can still read this to get general information that may apply to your
    environment as well.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="Compiling"><a class="permalink" href="#Compiling">Compiling the
    Program</a></dt>
  <dd>Your compiler needs to know where the libcurl headers are located.
      Therefore you must set your compiler's include path to point to the
      directory where you installed them. The 'curl-config'[3] tool can be used
      to get this information:
    <pre>
<br/>
  $ curl-config --cflags</pre>
  </dd>
  <dt id="Linking"><a class="permalink" href="#Linking">Linking the Program with
    libcurl</a></dt>
  <dd>When having compiled the program, you need to link your object files to
      create a single executable. For that to succeed, you need to link with
      libcurl and possibly also with other libraries that libcurl itself depends
      on. Like the OpenSSL libraries, but even some standard OS libraries may be
      needed on the command line. To figure out which flags to use, once again
      the 'curl-config' tool comes to the rescue:
    <pre>
<br/>
  $ curl-config --libs</pre>
  </dd>
  <dt id="SSL"><a class="permalink" href="#SSL">SSL or Not</a></dt>
  <dd>libcurl can be built and customized in many ways. One of the things that
      varies from different libraries and builds is the support for SSL-based
      transfers, like HTTPS and FTPS. If a supported SSL library was detected
      properly at build-time, libcurl will be built with SSL support. To figure
      out if an installed libcurl has been built with SSL support enabled, use
      'curl-config' like this:
    <pre>
<br/>
  $ curl-config --feature</pre>
    And if SSL is supported, the keyword <i>SSL</i> will be written to stdout,
      possibly together with a few other features that could be either on or off
      on for different libcurls.
    <p class="Pp">See also the &quot;Features libcurl Provides&quot; further
        down.</p>

  <dt id="autoconf"><a class="permalink" href="#autoconf">autoconf
    macro</a></dt>
  <dd>When you write your configure script to detect libcurl and setup variables
      accordingly, we offer a macro that probably does everything you need in
      this area. See docs/libcurl/libcurl.m4 file - it includes docs on how to
      use it.

  Code in a Portable World</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The people behind libcurl have put a considerable effort to make
    libcurl work on a large amount of different operating systems and
    environments.</p>
<p class="Pp">You program libcurl the same way on all platforms that libcurl
    runs on. There are only a few minor details that differ. If you just make
    sure to write your code portable enough, you can create a portable program.
    libcurl should not stop you from that.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="Global_Preparation"><a class="permalink" href="#Global_Preparation">Global
  Preparation</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The program must initialize some of the libcurl functionality
    globally. That means it should be done exactly once, no matter how many
    times you intend to use the library. Once for your program's entire life
    time. This is done using</p>
<pre>
<br/>
 curl_global_init()</pre>
<p class="Pp">and it takes one parameter which is a bit pattern that tells
    libcurl what to initialize. Using <i>CURL_GLOBAL_ALL</i> will make it
    initialize all known internal sub modules, and might be a good default
    option. The current two bits that are specified are:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="CURL_GLOBAL_WIN32"><a class="permalink" href="#CURL_GLOBAL_WIN32">CURL_GLOBAL_WIN32</a></dt>
  <dd>which only does anything on Windows machines. When used on a Windows
      machine, it will make libcurl initialize the win32 socket stuff. Without
      having that initialized properly, your program cannot use sockets
      properly. You should only do this once for each application, so if your
      program already does this or of another library in use does it, you should
      not tell libcurl to do this as well.</dd>
  <dt id="CURL_GLOBAL_SSL"><a class="permalink" href="#CURL_GLOBAL_SSL">CURL_GLOBAL_SSL</a></dt>
  <dd>which only does anything on libcurls compiled and built SSL-enabled. On
      these systems, this will make libcurl initialize the SSL library properly
      for this application. This only needs to be done once for each application
      so if your program or another library already does this, this bit should
      not be needed.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p class="Pp">libcurl has a default protection mechanism that detects if
    <i>curl_global_init(3)</i> has not been called by the time
    <i>curl_easy_perform(3)</i> is called and if that is the case, libcurl runs
    the function itself with a guessed bit pattern. Please note that depending
    solely on this is not considered nice nor good.</p>
<p class="Pp">When the program no longer uses libcurl, it should call
    <i>curl_global_cleanup(3)</i>, which is the opposite of the init call. It
    will then do the reversed operations to cleanup the resources the
    <i>curl_global_init(3)</i> call initialized.</p>
<p class="Pp">Repeated calls to <i>curl_global_init(3)</i> and
    <i>curl_global_cleanup(3)</i> should be avoided. They should only be called
    once each.</p>

<p class="Pp">It is considered best-practice to determine libcurl features at
    runtime rather than at build-time (if possible of course). By calling
    <i>curl_version_info(3)</i> and checking out the details of the returned
    struct, your program can figure out exactly what the currently running
    libcurl supports.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="Two_Interfaces"><a class="permalink" href="#Two_Interfaces">Two
  Interfaces</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">libcurl first introduced the so called easy interface. All
    operations in the easy interface are prefixed with 'curl_easy'. The easy
    interface lets you do single transfers with a synchronous and blocking
    function call.</p>
<p class="Pp">libcurl also offers another interface that allows multiple
    simultaneous transfers in a single thread, the so called multi interface.
    More about that interface is detailed in a separate chapter further down.
    You still need to understand the easy interface first, so please continue
    reading for better understanding.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="Handle_the_Easy_libcurl"><a class="permalink" href="#Handle_the_Easy_libcurl">Handle
  the Easy libcurl</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">To use the easy interface, you must first create yourself an easy
    handle. You need one handle for each easy session you want to perform.
    Basically, you should use one handle for every thread you plan to use for
    transferring. You must never share the same handle in multiple threads.</p>
<p class="Pp">Get an easy handle with</p>
<pre>
<br/>
 handle = curl_easy_init();</pre>
It returns an easy handle. Using that you proceed to the next step: setting up
  your preferred actions. A handle is just a logic entity for the upcoming
  transfer or series of transfers.
<p class="Pp">You set properties and options for this handle using
    <i>curl_easy_setopt(3)</i>. They control how the subsequent transfer or
    transfers will be made. Options remain set in the handle until set again to
    something different. They are sticky. Multiple requests using the same
    handle will use the same options.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you at any point would like to blank all previously set options
    for a single easy handle, you can call <i>curl_easy_reset(3)</i> and you can
    also make a clone of an easy handle (with all its set options) using
    <i>curl_easy_duphandle(3)</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Many of the options you set in libcurl are &quot;strings&quot;,
    pointers to data terminated with a zero byte. When you set strings with
    <i>curl_easy_setopt(3)</i>, libcurl makes its own copy so that they do not
    need to be kept around in your application after being set[4].</p>
<p class="Pp">One of the most basic properties to set in the handle is the URL.
    You set your preferred URL to transfer with <i>CURLOPT_URL(3)</i> in a
    manner similar to:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
<br/>
 curl_easy_setopt(handle, CURLOPT_URL, &quot;http://domain.com/&quot;);</pre>
<p class="Pp">Let's assume for a while that you want to receive data as the URL
    identifies a remote resource you want to get here. Since you write a sort of
    application that needs this transfer, I assume that you would like to get
    the data passed to you directly instead of simply getting it passed to
    stdout. So, you write your own function that matches this prototype:</p>
<pre>
<br/>
 size_t write_data(void *buffer, size_t size, size_t nmemb, void *userp);</pre>
You tell libcurl to pass all data to this function by issuing a function similar
  to this:
<pre>
<br/>
 curl_easy_setopt(handle, CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION, write_data);</pre>
You can control what data your callback function gets in the fourth argument by
  setting another property:
<pre>
<br/>
 curl_easy_setopt(handle, CURLOPT_WRITEDATA, &amp;internal_struct);</pre>
Using that property, you can easily pass local data between your application and
  the function that gets invoked by libcurl. libcurl itself will not touch the
  data you pass with <i>CURLOPT_WRITEDATA(3)</i>.
<p class="Pp">libcurl offers its own default internal callback that will take
    care of the data if you do not set the callback with
    <i>CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION(3)</i>. It will then simply output the received
    data to stdout. You can have the default callback write the data to a
    different file handle by passing a 'FILE *' to a file opened for writing
    with the <i>CURLOPT_WRITEDATA(3)</i> option.</p>
<p class="Pp">Now, we need to take a step back and have a deep breath. Here's
    one of those rare platform-dependent nitpicks. Did you spot it? On some
    platforms[2], libcurl will not be able to operate on files opened by the
    program. Thus, if you use the default callback and pass in an open file with
    <i>CURLOPT_WRITEDATA(3)</i>, it will crash. You should therefore avoid this
    to make your program run fine virtually everywhere.</p>
<p class="Pp">(<i>CURLOPT_WRITEDATA(3)</i> was formerly known as
    <i>CURLOPT_FILE</i>. Both names still work and do the same thing).</p>
<p class="Pp">If you are using libcurl as a win32 DLL, you MUST use the
    <i>CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION(3)</i> if you set <i>CURLOPT_WRITEDATA(3)</i> - or
    you will experience crashes.</p>
<p class="Pp">There are of course many more options you can set, and we will get
    back to a few of them later. Let's instead continue to the actual
  transfer:</p>
<pre>
<br/>
 success = curl_easy_perform(handle);</pre>
<i>curl_easy_perform(3)</i> will connect to the remote site, do the necessary
  commands and receive the transfer. Whenever it receives data, it calls the
  callback function we previously set. The function may get one byte at a time,
  or it may get many kilobytes at once. libcurl delivers as much as possible as
  often as possible. Your callback function should return the number of bytes it
  &quot;took care of&quot;. If that is not the same amount of bytes that was
  passed to it, libcurl will abort the operation and return with an error code.
<p class="Pp">When the transfer is complete, the function returns a return code
    that informs you if it succeeded in its mission or not. If a return code is
    not enough for you, you can use the <i>CURLOPT_ERRORBUFFER(3)</i> to point
    libcurl to a buffer of yours where it will store a human readable error
    message as well.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you then want to transfer another file, the handle is ready to
    be used again. Mind you, it is even preferred that you re-use an existing
    handle if you intend to make another transfer. libcurl will then attempt to
    re-use the previous connection.</p>
<p class="Pp">For some protocols, downloading a file can involve a complicated
    process of logging in, setting the transfer mode, changing the current
    directory and finally transferring the file data. libcurl takes care of all
    that complication for you. Given simply the URL to a file, libcurl will take
    care of all the details needed to get the file moved from one machine to
    another.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="When_It_does_not_Work"><a class="permalink" href="#When_It_does_not_Work">When
  It does not Work</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">There will always be times when the transfer fails for some
    reason. You might have set the wrong libcurl option or misunderstood what
    the libcurl option actually does, or the remote server might return
    non-standard replies that confuse the library which then confuses your
    program.</p>
<p class="Pp">There's one golden rule when these things occur: set the
    <i>CURLOPT_VERBOSE(3)</i> option to 1. it will cause the library to spew out
    the entire protocol details it sends, some internal info and some received
    protocol data as well (especially when using FTP). If you are using HTTP,
    adding the headers in the received output to study is also a clever way to
    get a better understanding why the server behaves the way it does. Include
    headers in the normal body output with <i>CURLOPT_HEADER(3)</i> set 1.</p>
<p class="Pp">Of course, there are bugs left. We need to know about them to be
    able to fix them, so we are quite dependent on your bug reports. When you do
    report suspected bugs in libcurl, please include as many details as you
    possibly can: a protocol dump that <i>CURLOPT_VERBOSE(3)</i> produces,
    library version, as much as possible of your code that uses libcurl,
    operating system name and version, compiler name and version etc.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <i>CURLOPT_VERBOSE(3)</i> is not enough, you increase the level
    of debug data your application receive by using the
    <i>CURLOPT_DEBUGFUNCTION(3)</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Getting some in-depth knowledge about the protocols involved is
    never wrong, and if you are trying to do funny things, you might understand
    libcurl and how to use it better if you study the appropriate RFC documents
    at least briefly.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="Upload_Data_to_a_Remote_Site"><a class="permalink" href="#Upload_Data_to_a_Remote_Site">Upload
  Data to a Remote Site</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">libcurl tries to keep a protocol independent approach to most
    transfers, thus uploading to a remote FTP site is similar to uploading data
    to an HTTP server with a PUT request.</p>
<p class="Pp">Of course, first you either create an easy handle or you re-use
    one existing one. Then you set the URL to operate on just like before. This
    is the remote URL, that we now will upload.</p>
<p class="Pp">Since we write an application, we most likely want libcurl to get
    the upload data by asking us for it. To make it do that, we set the read
    callback and the custom pointer libcurl will pass to our read callback. The
    read callback should have a prototype similar to:</p>
<pre>
<br/>
 size_t function(char *bufptr, size_t size, size_t nitems, void *userp);</pre>
Where <i>bufptr</i> is the pointer to a buffer we fill in with data to upload
  and <i>size*nitems</i> is the size of the buffer and therefore also the
  maximum amount of data we can return to libcurl in this call. The <i>userp</i>
  pointer is the custom pointer we set to point to a struct of ours to pass
  private data between the application and the callback.
<pre>
<br/>
 curl_easy_setopt(handle, CURLOPT_READFUNCTION, read_function);
<br/>
 curl_easy_setopt(handle, CURLOPT_READDATA, &amp;filedata);</pre>
Tell libcurl that we want to upload:
<pre>
<br/>
 curl_easy_setopt(handle, CURLOPT_UPLOAD, 1L);</pre>
<p class="Pp">A few protocols will not behave properly when uploads are done
    without any prior knowledge of the expected file size. So, set the upload
    file size using the <i>CURLOPT_INFILESIZE_LARGE(3)</i> for all known file
    sizes like this[1]:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
<br/>
 /* in this example, file_size must be an curl_off_t variable */
<br/>
 curl_easy_setopt(handle, CURLOPT_INFILESIZE_LARGE, file_size);</pre>
<p class="Pp">When you call <i>curl_easy_perform(3)</i> this time, it will
    perform all the necessary operations and when it has invoked the upload it
    will call your supplied callback to get the data to upload. The program
    should return as much data as possible in every invoke, as that is likely to
    make the upload perform as fast as possible. The callback should return the
    number of bytes it wrote in the buffer. Returning 0 will signal the end of
    the upload.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="Passwords"><a class="permalink" href="#Passwords">Passwords</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Many protocols use or even require that user name and password are
    provided to be able to download or upload the data of your choice. libcurl
    offers several ways to specify them.</p>
<p class="Pp">Most protocols support that you specify the name and password in
    the URL itself. libcurl will detect this and use them accordingly. This is
    written like this:</p>
<pre>
<br/>
 protocol://user:password@example.com/path/</pre>
If you need any odd letters in your user name or password, you should enter them
  URL encoded, as %XX where XX is a two-digit hexadecimal number.
<p class="Pp">libcurl also provides options to set various passwords. The user
    name and password as shown embedded in the URL can instead get set with the
    <i>CURLOPT_USERPWD(3)</i> option. The argument passed to libcurl should be a
    char * to a string in the format &quot;user:password&quot;. In a manner like
    this:</p>
<pre>
<br/>
 curl_easy_setopt(handle, CURLOPT_USERPWD, &quot;myname:thesecret&quot;);</pre>
Another case where name and password might be needed at times, is for those
  users who need to authenticate themselves to a proxy they use. libcurl offers
  another option for this, the <i>CURLOPT_PROXYUSERPWD(3)</i>. It is used quite
  similar to the <i>CURLOPT_USERPWD(3)</i> option like this:
<pre>
<br/>
 curl_easy_setopt(handle, CURLOPT_PROXYUSERPWD, &quot;myname:thesecret&quot;);</pre>
<p class="Pp">There's a long time Unix &quot;standard&quot; way of storing FTP
    user names and passwords, namely in the $HOME/.netrc file (on Windows,
    libcurl also checks the <i>%USERPROFILE% environment</i> variable if
    <i>%HOME%</i> is unset, and tries &quot;_netrc&quot; as name). The file
    should be made private so that only the user may read it (see also the
    &quot;Security Considerations&quot; chapter), as it might contain the
    password in plain text. libcurl has the ability to use this file to figure
    out what set of user name and password to use for a particular host. As an
    extension to the normal functionality, libcurl also supports this file for
    non-FTP protocols such as HTTP. To make curl use this file, use the
    <i>CURLOPT_NETRC(3)</i> option:</p>
<pre>
<br/>
 curl_easy_setopt(handle, CURLOPT_NETRC, 1L);</pre>
<p class="Pp">And a basic example of how such a .netrc file may look like:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
<br/>
 machine myhost.mydomain.com
<br/>
 login userlogin
<br/>
 password secretword</pre>
<p class="Pp">All these examples have been cases where the password has been
    optional, or at least you could leave it out and have libcurl attempt to do
    its job without it. There are times when the password is not optional, like
    when you are using an SSL private key for secure transfers.</p>
<p class="Pp">To pass the known private key password to libcurl:</p>
<pre>
<br/>
 curl_easy_setopt(handle, CURLOPT_KEYPASSWD, &quot;keypassword&quot;);</pre>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="HTTP_Authentication"><a class="permalink" href="#HTTP_Authentication">HTTP
  Authentication</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The previous chapter showed how to set user name and password for
    getting URLs that require authentication. When using the HTTP protocol,
    there are many different ways a client can provide those credentials to the
    server and you can control which way libcurl will (attempt to) use them. The
    default HTTP authentication method is called 'Basic', which is sending the
    name and password in clear-text in the HTTP request, base64-encoded. This is
    insecure.</p>
<p class="Pp">At the time of this writing, libcurl can be built to use: Basic,
    Digest, NTLM, Negotiate (SPNEGO). You can tell libcurl which one to use with
    <i>CURLOPT_HTTPAUTH(3)</i> as in:</p>
<pre>
<br/>
 curl_easy_setopt(handle, CURLOPT_HTTPAUTH, CURLAUTH_DIGEST);</pre>
And when you send authentication to a proxy, you can also set authentication
  type the same way but instead with <i>CURLOPT_PROXYAUTH(3)</i>:
<pre>
<br/>
 curl_easy_setopt(handle, CURLOPT_PROXYAUTH, CURLAUTH_NTLM);</pre>
<p class="Pp">Both these options allow you to set multiple types (by ORing them
    together), to make libcurl pick the most secure one out of the types the
    server/proxy claims to support. This method does however add a round-trip
    since libcurl must first ask the server what it supports:</p>
<pre>
<br/>
 curl_easy_setopt(handle, CURLOPT_HTTPAUTH, CURLAUTH_DIGEST|CURLAUTH_BASIC);</pre>
<p class="Pp">For convenience, you can use the <i>CURLAUTH_ANY</i> define
    (instead of a list with specific types) which allows libcurl to use whatever
    method it wants.</p>
<p class="Pp">When asking for multiple types, libcurl will pick the available
    one it considers &quot;best&quot; in its own internal order of
  preference.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="HTTP_POSTing"><a class="permalink" href="#HTTP_POSTing">HTTP
  POSTing</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">We get many questions regarding how to issue HTTP POSTs with
    libcurl the proper way. This chapter will thus include examples using both
    different versions of HTTP POST that libcurl supports.</p>
<p class="Pp">The first version is the simple POST, the most common version,
    that most HTML pages using the &lt;form&gt; tag uses. We provide a pointer
    to the data and tell libcurl to post it all to the remote site:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
<br/>
    char *data=&quot;name=daniel&amp;project=curl&quot;;
<br/>
    curl_easy_setopt(handle, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, data);
<br/>
    curl_easy_setopt(handle, CURLOPT_URL, &quot;http://posthere.com/&quot;);
<br/>
    curl_easy_perform(handle); /* post away! */</pre>
<p class="Pp">Simple enough, huh? Since you set the POST options with the
    <i>CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS(3)</i>, this automatically switches the handle to use
    POST in the upcoming request.</p>
<p class="Pp">What if you want to post binary data that also requires you to set
    the Content-Type: header of the post? Well, binary posts prevent libcurl
    from being able to do strlen() on the data to figure out the size, so
    therefore we must tell libcurl the size of the post data. Setting headers in
    libcurl requests are done in a generic way, by building a list of our own
    headers and then passing that list to libcurl.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
<br/>
 struct curl_slist *headers=NULL;
<br/>
 headers = curl_slist_append(headers, &quot;Content-Type: text/xml&quot;);
<br/>
 /* post binary data */
<br/>
 curl_easy_setopt(handle, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, binaryptr);
<br/>
 /* set the size of the postfields data */
<br/>
 curl_easy_setopt(handle, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDSIZE, 23L);
<br/>
 /* pass our list of custom made headers */
<br/>
 curl_easy_setopt(handle, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, headers);
<br/>
 curl_easy_perform(handle); /* post away! */
<br/>
 curl_slist_free_all(headers); /* free the header list */</pre>
<p class="Pp">While the simple examples above cover the majority of all cases
    where HTTP POST operations are required, they do not do multi-part
    formposts. Multi-part formposts were introduced as a better way to post
    (possibly large) binary data and were first documented in the RFC1867
    (updated in RFC2388). they are called multi-part because they are built by a
    chain of parts, each part being a single unit of data. Each part has its own
    name and contents. You can in fact create and post a multi-part formpost
    with the regular libcurl POST support described above, but that would
    require that you build a formpost yourself and provide to libcurl. To make
    that easier, libcurl provides a MIME API consisting in several functions:
    using those, you can create and fill a multi-part form. Function
    <i>curl_mime_init(3)</i> creates a multi-part body; you can then append new
    parts to a multi-part body using <i>curl_mime_addpart(3)</i>. There are
    three possible data sources for a part: memory using
    <i>curl_mime_data(3)</i>, file using <i>curl_mime_filedata(3)</i> and
    user-defined data read callback using <i>curl_mime_data_cb(3)</i>.
    <i>curl_mime_name(3)</i> sets a part's (i.e.: form field) name, while
    <i>curl_mime_filename(3)</i> fills in the remote file name. With
    <i>curl_mime_type(3)</i>, you can tell the MIME type of a part,
    <i>curl_mime_headers(3)</i> allows defining the part's headers. When a
    multi-part body is no longer needed, you can destroy it using
    <i>curl_mime_free(3)</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following example sets two simple text parts with plain
    textual contents, and then a file with binary contents and uploads the whole
    thing.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
<br/>
 curl_mime *multipart = curl_mime_init(handle);
<br/>
 curl_mimepart *part = curl_mime_addpart(multipart);
<br/>
 curl_mime_name(part, &quot;name&quot;);
<br/>
 curl_mime_data(part, &quot;daniel&quot;, CURL_ZERO_TERMINATED);
<br/>
 part = curl_mime_addpart(multipart);
<br/>
 curl_mime_name(part, &quot;project&quot;);
<br/>
 curl_mime_data(part, &quot;curl&quot;, CURL_ZERO_TERMINATED);
<br/>
 part = curl_mime_addpart(multipart);
<br/>
 curl_mime_name(part, &quot;logotype-image&quot;);
<br/>
 curl_mime_filedata(part, &quot;curl.png&quot;);
<br/>
 /* Set the form info */
<br/>
 curl_easy_setopt(handle, CURLOPT_MIMEPOST, multipart);
<br/>
 curl_easy_perform(handle); /* post away! */
<br/>
 /* free the post data again */
<br/>
 curl_mime_free(multipart);</pre>
<p class="Pp">To post multiple files for a single form field, you must supply
    each file in a separate part, all with the same field name. Although
    function <i>curl_mime_subparts(3)</i> implements nested multi-parts, this
    way of multiple files posting is deprecated by RFC 7578, chapter 4.3.</p>
<p class="Pp">To set the data source from an already opened FILE pointer,
  use:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
<br/>
 curl_mime_data_cb(part, filesize, (curl_read_callback) fread,
<br/>
                   (curl_seek_callback) fseek, NULL, filepointer);</pre>
<p class="Pp">A deprecated <i>curl_formadd(3)</i> function is still supported in
    libcurl. It should however not be used anymore for new designs and programs
    using it ought to be converted to the MIME API. It is however described here
    as an aid to conversion.</p>
<p class="Pp">Using <i>curl_formadd</i>, you add parts to the form. When you are
    done adding parts, you post the whole form.</p>
<p class="Pp">The MIME API example above is expressed as follows using this
    function:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
<br/>
 struct curl_httppost *post=NULL;
<br/>
 struct curl_httppost *last=NULL;
<br/>
 curl_formadd(&amp;post, &amp;last,
<br/>
              CURLFORM_COPYNAME, &quot;name&quot;,
<br/>
              CURLFORM_COPYCONTENTS, &quot;daniel&quot;, CURLFORM_END);
<br/>
 curl_formadd(&amp;post, &amp;last,
<br/>
              CURLFORM_COPYNAME, &quot;project&quot;,
<br/>
              CURLFORM_COPYCONTENTS, &quot;curl&quot;, CURLFORM_END);
<br/>
 curl_formadd(&amp;post, &amp;last,
<br/>
              CURLFORM_COPYNAME, &quot;logotype-image&quot;,
<br/>
              CURLFORM_FILECONTENT, &quot;curl.png&quot;, CURLFORM_END);
<br/>
 /* Set the form info */
<br/>
 curl_easy_setopt(handle, CURLOPT_HTTPPOST, post);
<br/>
 curl_easy_perform(handle); /* post away! */
<br/>
 /* free the post data again */
<br/>
 curl_formfree(post);</pre>
<p class="Pp">Multipart formposts are chains of parts using MIME-style
    separators and headers. It means that each one of these separate parts get a
    few headers set that describe the individual content-type, size etc. To
    enable your application to handicraft this formpost even more, libcurl
    allows you to supply your own set of custom headers to such an individual
    form part. You can of course supply headers to as many parts as you like,
    but this little example will show how you set headers to one specific part
    when you add that to the post handle:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
<br/>
 struct curl_slist *headers=NULL;
<br/>
 headers = curl_slist_append(headers, &quot;Content-Type: text/xml&quot;);
<br/>
 curl_formadd(&amp;post, &amp;last,
<br/>
              CURLFORM_COPYNAME, &quot;logotype-image&quot;,
<br/>
              CURLFORM_FILECONTENT, &quot;curl.xml&quot;,
<br/>
              CURLFORM_CONTENTHEADER, headers,
<br/>
              CURLFORM_END);
<br/>
 curl_easy_perform(handle); /* post away! */
<br/>
 curl_formfree(post); /* free post */
<br/>
 curl_slist_free_all(headers); /* free custom header list */</pre>
<p class="Pp">Since all options on an easy handle are &quot;sticky&quot;, they
    remain the same until changed even if you do call
    <i>curl_easy_perform(3)</i>, you may need to tell curl to go back to a plain
    GET request if you intend to do one as your next request. You force an easy
    handle to go back to GET by using the <i>CURLOPT_HTTPGET(3)</i> option:</p>
<pre>
<br/>
 curl_easy_setopt(handle, CURLOPT_HTTPGET, 1L);</pre>
Just setting <i>CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS(3)</i> to &quot;&quot; or NULL will *not*
  stop libcurl from doing a POST. It will just make it POST without any data to
  send!

<p class="Pp">Four rules have to be respected in building the multi-part:
  <br/>
  - The easy handle must be created before building the multi-part.
  <br/>
  - The multi-part is always created by a call to curl_mime_init(handle).
  <br/>
  - Each part is created by a call to curl_mime_addpart(multipart).
  <br/>
  - When complete, the multi-part must be bound to the easy handle using
    <i>CURLOPT_MIMEPOST(3)</i> instead of <i>CURLOPT_HTTPPOST(3)</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Here are some example of <i>curl_formadd</i> calls to MIME API
    sequences:</p>

<p class="Pp">Setting the last <i>curl_mime_headers</i> argument to TRUE would
    have caused the headers to be automatically released upon destroyed the

<h1 class="Sh" id="Showing_Progress"><a class="permalink" href="#Showing_Progress">Showing
  Progress</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">For historical and traditional reasons, libcurl has a built-in
    progress meter that can be switched on and then makes it present a progress
    meter in your terminal.</p>
<p class="Pp">Switch on the progress meter by, oddly enough, setting
    <i>CURLOPT_NOPROGRESS(3)</i> to zero. This option is set to 1 by
  default.</p>
<p class="Pp">For most applications however, the built-in progress meter is
    useless and what instead is interesting is the ability to specify a progress
    callback. The function pointer you pass to libcurl will then be called on
    irregular intervals with information about the current transfer.</p>
<p class="Pp">Set the progress callback by using
    <i>CURLOPT_PROGRESSFUNCTION(3)</i>. And pass a pointer to a function that
    matches this prototype:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
<br/>
 int progress_callback(void *clientp,

<p class="Pp">If any of the input arguments is unknown, a 0 will be passed. The
    first argument, the 'clientp' is the pointer you pass to libcurl with

<h1 class="Sh" id="Proxies"><a class="permalink" href="#Proxies">Proxies</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">What &quot;proxy&quot; means according to Merriam-Webster: &quot;a
    person authorized to act for another&quot; but also &quot;the agency,
    function, or office of a deputy who acts as a substitute for
  another&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">Proxies are exceedingly common these days. Companies often only
    offer Internet access to employees through their proxies. Network clients or
    user-agents ask the proxy for documents, the proxy does the actual request
    and then it returns them.</p>
<p class="Pp">libcurl supports SOCKS and HTTP proxies. When a given URL is
    wanted, libcurl will ask the proxy for it instead of trying to connect to
    the actual host identified in the URL.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you are using a SOCKS proxy, you may find that libcurl does not
    quite support all operations through it.</p>
<p class="Pp">For HTTP proxies: the fact that the proxy is an HTTP proxy puts
    certain restrictions on what can actually happen. A requested URL that might
    not be a HTTP URL will be still be passed to the HTTP proxy to deliver back
    to libcurl. This happens transparently, and an application may not need to
    know. I say &quot;may&quot;, because at times it is important to understand
    that all operations over an HTTP proxy use the HTTP protocol. For example,
    you cannot invoke your own custom FTP commands or even proper FTP directory
    listings.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="Proxy"><a class="permalink" href="#Proxy">Proxy Options</a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p class="Pp">To tell libcurl to use a proxy at a given port number:</p>
    <pre>
<br/>
 curl_easy_setopt(handle, CURLOPT_PROXY, &quot;proxy-host.com:8080&quot;);</pre>
    Some proxies require user authentication before allowing a request, and you
      pass that information similar to this:
    <pre>
<br/>
 curl_easy_setopt(handle, CURLOPT_PROXYUSERPWD, &quot;user:password&quot;);</pre>
    If you want to, you can specify the host name only in the
      <i>CURLOPT_PROXY(3)</i> option, and set the port number separately with
      <i>CURLOPT_PROXYPORT(3)</i>.
    <p class="Pp">Tell libcurl what kind of proxy it is with
        <i>CURLOPT_PROXYTYPE(3)</i> (if not, it will default to assume an HTTP
        proxy):</p>

  <dt id="Environment"><a class="permalink" href="#Environment">Environment
    Variables</a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p class="Pp">libcurl automatically checks and uses a set of environment
        variables to know what proxies to use for certain protocols. The names
        of the variables are following an old tradition and are built up as
        &quot;[protocol]_proxy&quot; (note the lower casing). Which makes the
        variable 'http_proxy' checked for a name of a proxy to use when the
        input URL is HTTP. Following the same rule, the variable named
        'ftp_proxy' is checked for FTP URLs. Again, the proxies are always HTTP
        proxies, the different names of the variables simply allows different
        HTTP proxies to be used.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The proxy environment variable contents should be in the
        format &quot;[protocol://][user:password@]machine[:port]&quot;. Where
        the protocol:// part specifies which type of proxy it is, and the
        optional port number specifies on which port the proxy operates. If not
        specified, the internal default port number will be used and that is
        most likely not the one you would like it to be.</p>
    <p class="Pp">There are two special environment variables. 'all_proxy' is
        what sets proxy for any URL in case the protocol specific variable was
        not set, and 'no_proxy' defines a list of hosts that should not use a
        proxy even though a variable may say so. If 'no_proxy' is a plain
        asterisk (&quot;*&quot;) it matches all hosts.</p>
    <p class="Pp">To explicitly disable libcurl's checking for and using the
        proxy environment variables, set the proxy name to &quot;&quot; - an
        empty string - with <i>CURLOPT_PROXY(3)</i>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="SSL~2"><a class="permalink" href="#SSL~2">SSL and Proxies</a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p class="Pp">SSL is for secure point-to-point connections. This involves
        strong encryption and similar things, which effectively makes it
        impossible for a proxy to operate as a &quot;man in between&quot; which
        the proxy's task is, as previously discussed. Instead, the only way to
        have SSL work over an HTTP proxy is to ask the proxy to tunnel
        everything through without being able to check or fiddle with the
        traffic.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Opening an SSL connection over an HTTP proxy is therefore a
        matter of asking the proxy for a straight connection to the target host
        on a specified port. This is made with the HTTP request CONNECT.
        (&quot;please dear proxy, connect me to that remote host&quot;).</p>
    <p class="Pp">Because of the nature of this operation, where the proxy has
        no idea what kind of data that is passed in and out through this tunnel,
        this breaks some of the few advantages that come from using a proxy,
        such as caching. Many organizations prevent this kind of tunneling to

  <dd>As explained above, tunneling is required for SSL to work and often even
      restricted to the operation intended for SSL; HTTPS.
    <p class="Pp">This is however not the only time proxy-tunneling might offer
        benefits to you or your application.</p>
    <p class="Pp">As tunneling opens a direct connection from your application
        to the remote machine, it suddenly also re-introduces the ability to do
        non-HTTP operations over an HTTP proxy. You can in fact use things such
        as FTP upload or FTP custom commands this way.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Again, this is often prevented by the administrators of
        proxies and is rarely allowed.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Tell libcurl to use proxy tunneling like this:</p>
    <pre>
<br/>
 curl_easy_setopt(handle, CURLOPT_HTTPPROXYTUNNEL, 1L);</pre>
    In fact, there might even be times when you want to do plain HTTP operations
      using a tunnel like this, as it then enables you to operate on the remote
      server instead of asking the proxy to do so. libcurl will not stand in the
      way for such innovative actions either!

    <p class="Pp">Netscape first came up with this. It is basically a web page
        (usually using a .pac extension) with a JavaScript that when executed by
        the browser with the requested URL as input, returns information to the
        browser on how to connect to the URL. The returned information might be
        &quot;DIRECT&quot; (which means no proxy should be used), &quot;PROXY
        host:port&quot; (to tell the browser where the proxy for this particular
        URL is) or &quot;SOCKS host:port&quot; (to direct the browser to a SOCKS
        proxy).</p>
    <p class="Pp">libcurl has no means to interpret or evaluate JavaScript and
        thus it does not support this. If you get yourself in a position where
        you face this nasty invention, the following advice have been mentioned
        and used in the past:</p>
    <p class="Pp">- Depending on the JavaScript complexity, write up a script
        that translates it to another language and execute that.</p>
    <p class="Pp">- Read the JavaScript code and rewrite the same logic in
        another language.</p>
    <p class="Pp">- Implement a JavaScript interpreter; people have successfully
        used the Mozilla JavaScript engine in the past.</p>
    <p class="Pp">- Ask your admins to stop this, for a static proxy setup or
        similar.</p>

<p class="Pp">Re-cycling the same easy handle several times when doing multiple
    requests is the way to go.</p>
<p class="Pp">After each single <i>curl_easy_perform(3)</i> operation, libcurl
    will keep the connection alive and open. A subsequent request using the same
    easy handle to the same host might just be able to use the already open
    connection! This reduces network impact a lot.</p>
<p class="Pp">Even if the connection is dropped, all connections involving SSL
    to the same host again, will benefit from libcurl's session ID cache that
    drastically reduces re-connection time.</p>
<p class="Pp">FTP connections that are kept alive save a lot of time, as the
    command- response round-trips are skipped, and also you do not risk getting
    blocked without permission to login again like on many FTP servers only
    allowing N persons to be logged in at the same time.</p>
<p class="Pp">libcurl caches DNS name resolving results, to make lookups of a
    previously looked up name a lot faster.</p>
<p class="Pp">Other interesting details that improve performance for subsequent
    requests may also be added in the future.</p>
<p class="Pp">Each easy handle will attempt to keep the last few connections
    alive for a while in case they are to be used again. You can set the size of
    this &quot;cache&quot; with the <i>CURLOPT_MAXCONNECTS(3)</i> option.
    Default is 5. There is rarely any point in changing this value, and if you
    think of changing this it is often just a matter of thinking again.</p>
<p class="Pp">To force your upcoming request to not use an already existing
    connection (it will even close one first if there happens to be one alive to
    the same host you are about to operate on), you can do that by setting
    <i>CURLOPT_FRESH_CONNECT(3)</i> to 1. In a similar spirit, you can also
    forbid the upcoming request to be &quot;lying&quot; around and possibly get
    re-used after the request by setting <i>CURLOPT_FORBID_REUSE(3)</i> to
  1.</p>

    HTTP is a tested and reliable protocol that is widely deployed and has
    excellent proxy-support.</p>
<p class="Pp">When you use one of these protocols, and even when doing other
    kinds of programming you may need to change the traditional HTTP (or FTP

      <i>CURLOPT_CUSTOMREQUEST(3)</i> is there for you. It is simple to use:
    <pre>
<br/>
 curl_easy_setopt(handle, CURLOPT_CUSTOMREQUEST, &quot;MYOWNREQUEST&quot;);</pre>
    When using the custom request, you change the request keyword of the actual
      request you are performing. Thus, by default you make a GET request but
      you can also make a POST operation (as described before) and then replace
      the POST keyword if you want to. you are the boss.

  <dd>HTTP-like protocols pass a series of headers to the server when doing the

      think fit. Adding headers is this easy:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
<br/>
 struct curl_slist *headers=NULL; /* init to NULL is important */

 headers = curl_slist_append(headers, &quot;Hey-server-hey: how are you?&quot;);

 curl_easy_setopt(handle, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, headers);
<br/>
 curl_easy_perform(handle); /* transfer http */
<br/>
 curl_slist_free_all(headers); /* free the header list */</pre>
    <p class="Pp">... and if you think some of the internally generated headers,
        such as Accept: or Host: do not contain the data you want them to
        contain, you can replace them by simply setting them too:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
<br/>
 headers = curl_slist_append(headers, &quot;Accept: Agent-007&quot;);

  </dd>
  <dt id="Delete"><a class="permalink" href="#Delete">Delete Headers</a></dt>
  <dd>If you replace an existing header with one with no contents, you will

    <p class="Pp">
      <br/>
       headers = curl_slist_append(headers, &quot;Accept:&quot;);</p>

        Some old servers do not like getting 1.1-requests and when dealing with

        by doing something like this:</p>

        help you when you want to make, for example, your FTP transfers to
        behave differently.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Sending custom commands to an FTP server means that you need
        to send the commands exactly as the FTP server expects them (RFC959 is a
        good guide here), and you can only use commands that work on the
        control-connection alone. All kinds of commands that require data
        interchange and thus need a data-connection must be left to libcurl's
        own judgment. Also be aware that libcurl will do its best to change
        directory to the target directory before doing any transfer, so if you
        change directory (with CWD or similar) you might confuse libcurl and
        then it might not attempt to transfer the file in the correct remote
        directory.</p>
    <p class="Pp">A little example that deletes a given file before an
        operation:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
<br/>
 headers = curl_slist_append(headers, &quot;DELE file-to-remove&quot;);
<br/>
 /* pass the list of custom commands to the handle */

 curl_easy_setopt(handle, CURLOPT_QUOTE, headers);
<br/>
 curl_easy_perform(handle); /* transfer ftp data! */
<br/>
 curl_slist_free_all(headers); /* free the header list */</pre>
    <p class="Pp">If you would instead want this operation (or chain of
        operations) to happen _after_ the data transfer took place the option to
        <i>curl_easy_setopt(3)</i> would instead be called
        <i>CURLOPT_POSTQUOTE(3)</i> and used the exact same way.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The custom FTP command will be issued to the server in the
        same order they are added to the list, and if a command gets an error
        code returned back from the server, no more commands will be issued and
        libcurl will bail out with an error code (CURLE_QUOTE_ERROR). Note that
        if you use <i>CURLOPT_QUOTE(3)</i> to send commands before a transfer,
        no transfer will actually take place when a quote command has
      failed.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you set the <i>CURLOPT_HEADER(3)</i> to 1, you will tell
        libcurl to get information about the target file and output
        &quot;headers&quot; about it. The headers will be in
        &quot;HTTP-style&quot;, looking like they do in HTTP.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The option to enable headers or to run custom FTP commands may
        be useful to combine with <i>CURLOPT_NOBODY(3)</i>. If this option is
        set, no actual file content transfer will be performed.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="Cookies_Without_Chocolate_Chips"><a class="permalink" href="#Cookies_Without_Chocolate_Chips">Cookies
  Without Chocolate Chips</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">In the HTTP sense, a cookie is a name with an associated value. A
    server sends the name and value to the client, and expects it to get sent
    back on every subsequent request to the server that matches the particular
    conditions set. The conditions include that the domain name and path match
    and that the cookie has not become too old.</p>
<p class="Pp">In real-world cases, servers send new cookies to replace existing
    ones to update them. Server use cookies to &quot;track&quot; users and to
    keep &quot;sessions&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">Cookies are sent from server to clients with the header
    Set-Cookie: and they are sent from clients to servers with the Cookie:
    header.</p>
<p class="Pp">To just send whatever cookie you want to a server, you can use
    <i>CURLOPT_COOKIE(3)</i> to set a cookie string like this:</p>
<pre>
<br/>
 curl_easy_setopt(handle, CURLOPT_COOKIE, &quot;name1=var1; name2=var2;&quot;);</pre>
In many cases, that is not enough. You might want to dynamically save whatever
  cookies the remote server passes to you, and make sure those cookies are then
  used accordingly on later requests.
<p class="Pp">One way to do this, is to save all headers you receive in a plain
    file and when you make a request, you tell libcurl to read the previous
    headers to figure out which cookies to use. Set the header file to read
    cookies from with <i>CURLOPT_COOKIEFILE(3)</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>CURLOPT_COOKIEFILE(3)</i> option also automatically enables
    the cookie parser in libcurl. Until the cookie parser is enabled, libcurl
    will not parse or understand incoming cookies and they will just be ignored.
    However, when the parser is enabled the cookies will be understood and the
    cookies will be kept in memory and used properly in subsequent requests when
    the same handle is used. Many times this is enough, and you may not have to
    save the cookies to disk at all. Note that the file you specify to
    <i>CURLOPT_COOKIEFILE(3)</i> does not have to exist to enable the parser, so
    a common way to just enable the parser and not read any cookies is to use
    the name of a file you know does not exist.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you would rather use existing cookies that you have previously
    received with your Netscape or Mozilla browsers, you can make libcurl use
    that cookie file as input. The <i>CURLOPT_COOKIEFILE(3)</i> is used for that
    too, as libcurl will automatically find out what kind of file it is and act
    accordingly.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perhaps the most advanced cookie operation libcurl offers, is
    saving the entire internal cookie state back into a Netscape/Mozilla
    formatted cookie file. We call that the cookie-jar. When you set a file name
    with <i>CURLOPT_COOKIEJAR(3)</i>, that file name will be created and all
    received cookies will be stored in it when <i>curl_easy_cleanup(3)</i> is
    called. This enables cookies to get passed on properly between multiple
    handles without any information getting lost.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="FTP_Peculiarities_We_Need"><a class="permalink" href="#FTP_Peculiarities_We_Need">FTP
  Peculiarities We Need</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">FTP transfers use a second TCP/IP connection for the data
    transfer. This is usually a fact you can forget and ignore but at times this
    fact will come back to haunt you. libcurl offers several different ways to
    customize how the second connection is being made.</p>
<p class="Pp">libcurl can either connect to the server a second time or tell the
    server to connect back to it. The first option is the default and it is also
    what works best for all the people behind firewalls, NATs or IP-masquerading
    setups. libcurl then tells the server to open up a new port and wait for a
    second connection. This is by default attempted with EPSV first, and if that
    does not work it tries PASV instead. (EPSV is an extension to the original
    FTP spec and does not exist nor work on all FTP servers.)</p>
<p class="Pp">You can prevent libcurl from first trying the EPSV command by
    setting <i>CURLOPT_FTP_USE_EPSV(3)</i> to zero.</p>
<p class="Pp">In some cases, you will prefer to have the server connect back to
    you for the second connection. This might be when the server is perhaps
    behind a firewall or something and only allows connections on a single port.
    libcurl then informs the remote server which IP address and port number to
    connect to. This is made with the <i>CURLOPT_FTPPORT(3)</i> option. If you
    set it to &quot;-&quot;, libcurl will use your system's &quot;default IP
    address&quot;. If you want to use a particular IP, you can set the full IP
    address, a host name to resolve to an IP address or even a local network
    interface name that libcurl will get the IP address from.</p>
<p class="Pp">When doing the &quot;PORT&quot; approach, libcurl will attempt to
    use the EPRT and the LPRT before trying PORT, as they work with more
    protocols. You can disable this behavior by setting
    <i>CURLOPT_FTP_USE_EPRT(3)</i> to zero.</p>

  API revisited for SMTP and IMAP</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">In addition to support HTTP multi-part form fields, the MIME API
    can be used to build structured email messages and send them via SMTP or
    append such messages to IMAP directories.</p>
<p class="Pp">A structured email message may contain several parts: some are
    displayed inline by the MUA, some are attachments. Parts can also be
    structured as multi-part, for example to include another email message or to
    offer several text formats alternatives. This can be nested to any
  level.</p>
<p class="Pp">To build such a message, you prepare the nth-level multi-part and
    then include it as a source to the parent multi-part using function
    <i>curl_mime_subparts(3)</i>. Once it has been bound to its parent
    multi-part, a nth-level multi-part belongs to it and should not be freed
    explicitly.</p>
<p class="Pp">Email messages data is not supposed to be non-ascii and line
    length is limited: fortunately, some transfer encodings are defined by the
    standards to support the transmission of such incompatible data. Function
    <i>curl_mime_encoder(3)</i> tells a part that its source data must be
    encoded before being sent. It also generates the corresponding header for
    that part. If the part data you want to send is already encoded in such a
    scheme, do not use this function (this would over-encode it), but explicitly
    set the corresponding part header.</p>
<p class="Pp">Upon sending such a message, libcurl prepends it with the header
    list set with <i>CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER(3)</i>, as zero level mime part
  headers.</p>
<p class="Pp">Here is an example building an email message with an inline
    plain/html text alternative and a file attachment encoded in base64:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>

<p class="Pp">What might be even more useful, is libcurl's ability to separate

  multi Interface</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The easy interface as described in detail in this document is a
    synchronous interface that transfers one file at a time and does not return
    until it is done.</p>
<p class="Pp">The multi interface, on the other hand, allows your program to
    transfer multiple files in both directions at the same time, without forcing
    you to use multiple threads. The name might make it seem that the multi
    interface is for multi-threaded programs, but the truth is almost the
    reverse. The multi interface allows a single-threaded application to perform
    the same kinds of multiple, simultaneous transfers that multi-threaded
    programs can perform. It allows many of the benefits of multi-threaded
    transfers without the complexity of managing and synchronizing many
  threads.</p>
<p class="Pp">To complicate matters somewhat more, there are even two versions
    of the multi interface. The event based one, also called multi_socket and
    the &quot;normal one&quot; designed for using with select(). See the
    libcurl-multi.3 man page for details on the multi_socket event based API,
    this description here is for the select() oriented one.</p>
<p class="Pp">To use this interface, you are better off if you first understand
    the basics of how to use the easy interface. The multi interface is simply a
    way to make multiple transfers at the same time by adding up multiple easy
    handles into a &quot;multi stack&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">You create the easy handles you want, one for each concurrent
    transfer, and you set all the options just like you learned above, and then
    you create a multi handle with <i>curl_multi_init(3)</i> and add all those
    easy handles to that multi handle with <i>curl_multi_add_handle(3)</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">When you have added the handles you have for the moment (you can
    still add new ones at any time), you start the transfers by calling
    <i>curl_multi_perform(3)</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>curl_multi_perform(3)</i> is asynchronous. It will only perform
    what can be done now and then return control to your program. It is designed
    to never block. You need to keep calling the function until all transfers
    are completed.</p>
<p class="Pp">The best usage of this interface is when you do a select() on all
    possible file descriptors or sockets to know when to call libcurl again.
    This also makes it easy for you to wait and respond to actions on your own
    application's sockets/handles. You figure out what to select() for by using
    <i>curl_multi_fdset(3)</i>, that fills in a set of <i>fd_set</i> variables
    for you with the particular file descriptors libcurl uses for the
  moment.</p>
<p class="Pp">When you then call select(), it will return when one of the file
    handles signal action and you then call <i>curl_multi_perform(3)</i> to
    allow libcurl to do what it wants to do. Take note that libcurl does also
    feature some time-out code so we advise you to never use long timeouts on
    select() before you call <i>curl_multi_perform(3)</i> again.
    <i>curl_multi_timeout(3)</i> is provided to help you get a suitable timeout
    period.</p>
<p class="Pp">Another precaution you should use: always call
    <i>curl_multi_fdset(3)</i> immediately before the select() call since the
    current set of file descriptors may change in any curl function invoke.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you want to stop the transfer of one of the easy handles in the
    stack, you can use <i>curl_multi_remove_handle(3)</i> to remove individual
    easy handles. Remember that easy handles should be
    <i>curl_easy_cleanup(3)</i>ed.</p>
<p class="Pp">When a transfer within the multi stack has finished, the counter
    of running transfers (as filled in by <i>curl_multi_perform(3)</i>) will
    decrease. When the number reaches zero, all transfers are done.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>curl_multi_info_read(3)</i> can be used to get information
    about completed transfers. It then returns the CURLcode for each easy
    transfer, to allow you to figure out success on each individual
  transfer.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="Sharing_Data_Between_Easy_Handles"><a class="permalink" href="#Sharing_Data_Between_Easy_Handles">Sharing
  Data Between Easy Handles</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">You can share some data between easy handles when the easy
    interface is used, and some data is share automatically when you use the
    multi interface.</p>
<p class="Pp">When you add easy handles to a multi handle, these easy handles
    will automatically share a lot of the data that otherwise would be kept on a
    per-easy handle basis when the easy interface is used.</p>
<p class="Pp">The DNS cache is shared between handles within a multi handle,
    making subsequent name resolving faster, and the connection pool that is
    kept to better allow persistent connections and connection re-use is also
    shared. If you are using the easy interface, you can still share these
    between specific easy handles by using the share interface, see
    <i>libcurl-share(3)</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Some things are never shared automatically, not within multi
    handles, like for example cookies so the only way to share that is with the
    share interface.</p>
