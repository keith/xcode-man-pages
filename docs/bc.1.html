<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>bc</b> is a language that supports arbitrary precision numbers with
  interactive execution of statements. There are some similarities in the syntax
  to the C programming language. A standard math library is available by command
  line option. If requested, the math library is defined before processing any
  files. <b>bc</b> starts by processing code from all the files listed on the
  command line in the order listed. After all files have been processed,
  <b>bc</b> reads from the standard input. All code is executed as it is read.
  (If a file contains a command to halt the processor, <b>bc</b> will never read
  from the standard input.)
<p class="Pp">This version of <b>bc</b> contains several extensions beyond
    traditional <b>bc</b> implementations and the POSIX draft standard. Command
    line options can cause these extensions to print a warning or to be
    rejected. This document describes the language accepted by this processor.
    Extensions will be identified as such.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="NUMBERS"><a class="permalink" href="#NUMBERS">NUMBERS</a></h2>
The most basic element in <b>bc</b> is the number. Numbers are arbitrary
  precision numbers. This precision is both in the integer part and the
  fractional part. All numbers are represented internally in decimal and all
  computation is done in decimal. (This version truncates results from divide
  and multiply operations.) There are two attributes of numbers, the length and
  the scale. The length is the total number of significant decimal digits in a
  number and the scale is the total number of decimal digits after the decimal
  point. For example:
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
 .000001 has a length of 6 and scale of 6.
 1935.000 has a length of 7 and a scale of 3.
</pre>
</div>
<pre>
</pre>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="VARIABLES"><a class="permalink" href="#VARIABLES">VARIABLES</a></h2>
Numbers are stored in two types of variables, simple variables and arrays. Both
  simple variables and array variables are named. Names begin with a letter
  followed by any number of letters, digits and underscores. All letters must be
  lower case. (Full alpha-numeric names are an extension. In POSIX <b>bc</b> all
  names are a single lower case letter.) The type of variable is clear by the
  context because all array variable names will be followed by brackets ([]).
<p class="Pp">There are four special variables, <b>scale, ibase, obase,</b> and
    <b>last</b>. <b>scale</b> defines how some operations use digits after the
    decimal point. The default value of <b>scale</b> is 0. <b>ibase</b> and
    <b>obase</b> define the conversion base for input and output numbers. The
    default for both input and output is base 10. <b>last</b> (an extension) is
    a variable that has the value of the last printed number. These will be
    discussed in further detail where appropriate. All of these variables may
    have values assigned to them as well as used in expressions.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="COMMENTS"><a class="permalink" href="#COMMENTS">COMMENTS</a></h2>
Comments in <b>bc</b> start with the characters <b>/*</b> and end with the
  characters <b>*/</b>. Comments may start anywhere and appear as a single space
  in the input. (This causes comments to delimit other input items. For example,
  a comment can not be found in the middle of a variable name.) Comments include
  any newlines (end of line) between the start and the end of the comment.
<p class="Pp">To support the use of scripts for <b>bc</b>, a single line comment
    has been added as an extension. A single line comment starts at a <b>#</b>
    character and continues to the next end of the line. The end of line
    character is not part of the comment and is processed normally.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="EXPRESSIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#EXPRESSIONS">EXPRESSIONS</a></h2>
The numbers are manipulated by expressions and statements. Since the language
  was designed to be interactive, statements and expressions are executed as
  soon as possible. There is no &quot;main&quot; program. Instead, code is
  executed as it is encountered. (Functions, discussed in detail later, are
  defined when encountered.)
<p class="Pp">A simple expression is just a constant. <b>bc</b> converts
    constants into internal decimal numbers using the current input base,
    specified by the variable <b>ibase</b>. (There is an exception in
    functions.) The legal values of <b>ibase</b> are 2 through 16. Assigning a
    value outside this range to <b>ibase</b> will result in a value of 2 or 16.
    Input numbers may contain the characters 0-9 and A-F. (Note: They must be
    capitals. Lower case letters are variable names.) Single digit numbers
    always have the value of the digit regardless of the value of <b>ibase</b>.
    (i.e. A = 10.) For multi-digit numbers, <b>bc</b> changes all input digits
    greater or equal to ibase to the value of <b>ibase</b>-1. This makes the
    number <b>FFF</b> always be the largest 3 digit number of the input
  base.</p>
<p class="Pp">Full expressions are similar to many other high level languages.
    Since there is only one kind of number, there are no rules for mixing types.
    Instead, there are rules on the scale of expressions. Every expression has a
    scale. This is derived from the scale of original numbers, the operation
    performed and in many cases, the value of the variable <b>scale</b>. Legal
    values of the variable <b>scale</b> are 0 to the maximum number
    representable by a C integer.</p>
<p class="Pp">In the following descriptions of legal expressions,
    &quot;expr&quot; refers to a complete expression and &quot;var&quot; refers
    to a simple or an array variable. A simple variable is just a</p>
<div class="Bd-indent"><i>name</i></div>
and an array variable is specified as
<div class="Bd-indent"><i>name</i>[<i>expr</i>]</div>
Unless specifically mentioned the scale of the result is the maximum scale of
  the expressions involved.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>- expr</dt>
  <dd>The result is the negation of the expression.</dd>
  <dt>++ var</dt>
  <dd>The variable is incremented by one and the new value is the result of the
      expression.</dd>
  <dt>-- var</dt>
  <dd>The variable is decremented by one and the new value is the result of the
      expression.</dd>
  <dt>var ++</dt>
  <dd>
     The result of the expression is the value of the variable and then the
      variable is incremented by one.</dd>
  <dt>var --</dt>
  <dd>The result of the expression is the value of the variable and then the
      variable is decremented by one.</dd>
  <dt>expr + expr</dt>
  <dd>The result of the expression is the sum of the two expressions.</dd>
  <dt>expr - expr</dt>
  <dd>The result of the expression is the difference of the two
    expressions.</dd>
  <dt>expr * expr</dt>
  <dd>The result of the expression is the product of the two expressions.</dd>
  <dt>expr / expr</dt>
  <dd>The result of the expression is the quotient of the two expressions. The
      scale of the result is the value of the variable <b>scale</b>.</dd>
  <dt>expr % expr</dt>
  <dd>The result of the expression is the &quot;remainder&quot; and it is
      computed in the following way. To compute a%b, first a/b is computed to
      <b>scale</b> digits. That result is used to compute a-(a/b)*b to the scale
      of the maximum of <b>scale</b>+scale(b) and scale(a). If <b>scale</b> is
      set to zero and both expressions are integers this expression is the
      integer remainder function.</dd>
  <dt>expr ^ expr</dt>
  <dd>The result of the expression is the value of the first raised to the
      second. The second expression must be an integer. (If the second
      expression is not an integer, a warning is generated and the expression is
      truncated to get an integer value.) The scale of the result is
      <b>scale</b> if the exponent is negative. If the exponent is positive the
      scale of the result is the minimum of the scale of the first expression
      times the value of the exponent and the maximum of <b>scale</b> and the
      scale of the first expression. (e.g. scale(a^b) = min(scale(a)*b, max(
      <b>scale,</b> scale(a))).) It should be noted that expr^0 will always
      return the value of 1.</dd>
  <dt>( expr )</dt>
  <dd>This alters the standard precedence to force the evaluation of the
      expression.</dd>
  <dt>var = expr</dt>
  <dd>The variable is assigned the value of the expression.</dd>
  <dt>var &lt;op&gt;= expr</dt>
  <dd>This is equivalent to &quot;var = var &lt;op&gt; expr&quot; with the
      exception that the &quot;var&quot; part is evaluated only once. This can
      make a difference if &quot;var&quot; is an array.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">
   Relational expressions are a special kind of expression that always evaluate
    to 0 or 1, 0 if the relation is false and 1 if the relation is true. These
    may appear in any legal expression. (POSIX bc requires that relational
    expressions are used only in if, while, and for statements and that only one
    relational test may be done in them.) The relational operators are</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>expr1 &lt; expr2</dt>
  <dd>The result is 1 if expr1 is strictly less than expr2.</dd>
  <dt>expr1 &lt;= expr2</dt>
  <dd>The result is 1 if expr1 is less than or equal to expr2.</dd>
  <dt>expr1 &gt; expr2</dt>
  <dd>The result is 1 if expr1 is strictly greater than expr2.</dd>
  <dt>expr1 &gt;= expr2</dt>
  <dd>The result is 1 if expr1 is greater than or equal to expr2.</dd>
  <dt>expr1 == expr2</dt>
  <dd>The result is 1 if expr1 is equal to expr2.</dd>
  <dt>expr1 != expr2</dt>
  <dd>The result is 1 if expr1 is not equal to expr2.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Boolean operations are also legal. (POSIX <b>bc</b> does NOT have
    boolean operations). The result of all boolean operations are 0 and 1 (for
    false and true) as in relational expressions. The boolean operators are:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>!expr</dt>
  <dd>The result is 1 if expr is 0.</dd>
  <dt>expr &amp;&amp; expr</dt>
  <dd>The result is 1 if both expressions are non-zero.</dd>
  <dt>expr || expr</dt>
  <dd>The result is 1 if either expression is non-zero.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The expression precedence is as follows: (lowest to highest)</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
|| operator, left associative
&amp;&amp; operator, left associative
! operator, nonassociative
Relational operators, left associative
Assignment operator, right associative
+ and - operators, left associative
*, / and % operators, left associative
^ operator, right associative
unary - operator, nonassociative
++ and -- operators, nonassociative
</pre>
</div>
<pre>
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This precedence was chosen so that POSIX compliant <b>bc</b>
    programs will run correctly. This will cause the use of the relational and
    logical operators to have some unusual behavior when used with assignment
    expressions. Consider the expression:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">a = 3 &lt; 5</div>
<p class="Pp">Most C programmers would assume this would assign the result of
    &quot;3 &lt; 5&quot; (the value 1) to the variable &quot;a&quot;. What this
    does in <b>bc</b> is assign the value 3 to the variable &quot;a&quot; and
    then compare 3 to 5. It is best to use parenthesis when using relational and
    logical operators with the assignment operators.</p>
<p class="Pp">There are a few more special expressions that are provided in
    <b>bc</b>. These have to do with user defined functions and standard
    functions. They all appear as
    &quot;<i>name</i><b>(</b><i>parameters</i><b>)</b>&quot;. See the section on
    functions for user defined functions. The standard functions are:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>length ( expression )</dt>
  <dd>The value of the length function is the number of significant digits in
      the expression.</dd>
  <dt>read ( )</dt>
  <dd>The read function (an extension) will read a number from the standard
      input, regardless of where the function occurs. Beware, this can cause
      problems with the mixing of data and program in the standard input. The
      best use for this function is in a previously written program that needs
      input from the user, but never allows program code to be input from the
      user. The value of the read function is the number read from the standard
      input using the current value of the variable <b>ibase</b> for the
      conversion base.</dd>
  <dt>scale ( expression )</dt>
  <dd>The value of the scale function is the number of digits after the decimal
      point in the expression.</dd>
  <dt>sqrt ( expression )</dt>
  <dd>The value of the sqrt function is the square root of the expression. If
      the expression is negative, a run time error is generated.</dd>
</dl>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="STATEMENTS"><a class="permalink" href="#STATEMENTS">STATEMENTS</a></h2>
Statements (as in most algebraic languages) provide the sequencing of expression
  evaluation. In <b>bc</b> statements are executed &quot;as soon as
  possible.&quot; Execution happens when a newline in encountered and there is
  one or more complete statements. Due to this immediate execution, newlines are
  very important in <b>bc</b>. In fact, both a semicolon and a newline are used
  as statement separators. An improperly placed newline will cause a syntax
  error. Because newlines are statement separators, it is possible to hide a
  newline by using the backslash character. The sequence
  &quot;\&lt;nl&gt;&quot;, where &lt;nl&gt; is the newline appears to <b>bc</b>
  as whitespace instead of a newline. A statement list is a series of statements
  separated by semicolons and newlines. The following is a list of <b>bc</b>
  statements and what they do: (Things enclosed in brackets ([]) are optional
  parts of the statement.)
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>expression</dt>
  <dd>This statement does one of two things. If the expression starts with
      &quot;&lt;variable&gt; &lt;assignment&gt; ...&quot;, it is considered to
      be an assignment statement. If the expression is not an assignment
      statement, the expression is evaluated and printed to the output. After
      the number is printed, a newline is printed. For example, &quot;a=1&quot;
      is an assignment statement and &quot;(a=1)&quot; is an expression that has
      an embedded assignment. All numbers that are printed are printed in the
      base specified by the variable <b>obase</b>. The legal values for <b></b>
      <b>obase</b> are 2 through BC_BASE_MAX. (See the section LIMITS.) For
      bases 2 through 16, the usual method of writing numbers is used. For bases
      greater than 16, <b>bc</b> uses a multi-character digit method of printing
      the numbers where each higher base digit is printed as a base 10 number.
      The multi-character digits are separated by spaces. Each digit contains
      the number of characters required to represent the base ten value of
      &quot;obase-1&quot;. Since numbers are of arbitrary precision, some
      numbers may not be printable on a single output line. These long numbers
      will be split across lines using the &quot;\&quot; as the last character
      on a line. The maximum number of characters printed per line is 70. Due to
      the interactive nature of <b>bc</b>, printing a number causes the side
      effect of assigning the printed value to the special variable <b>last</b>.
      This allows the user to recover the last value printed without having to
      retype the expression that printed the number. Assigning to <b>last</b> is
      legal and will overwrite the last printed value with the assigned value.
      The newly assigned value will remain until the next number is printed or
      another value is assigned to <b>last</b>. (Some installations may allow
      the use of a single period (.) which is not part of a number as a short
      hand notation for for <b>last</b>.)</dd>
  <dt>string</dt>
  <dd>The string is printed to the output. Strings start with a double quote
      character and contain all characters until the next double quote
      character. All characters are take literally, including any newline. No
      newline character is printed after the string.</dd>
  <dt><b>print</b> list</dt>
  <dd>The print statement (an extension) provides another method of output. The
      &quot;list&quot; is a list of strings and expressions separated by commas.
      Each string or expression is printed in the order of the list. No
      terminating newline is printed. Expressions are evaluated and their value
      is printed and assigned to the variable <b>last</b>. Strings in the print
      statement are printed to the output and may contain special characters.
      Special characters start with the backslash character (\). The special
      characters recognized by <b>bc</b> are &quot;a&quot; (alert or bell),
      &quot;b&quot; (backspace), &quot;f&quot; (form feed), &quot;n&quot;
      (newline), &quot;r&quot; (carriage return), &quot;q&quot; (double quote),
      &quot;t&quot; (tab), and &quot;\&quot; (backslash). Any other character
      following the backslash will be ignored.</dd>
  <dt>{ statement_list }</dt>
  <dd>This is the compound statement. It allows multiple statements to be
      grouped together for execution.</dd>
  <dt><b>if</b> ( expression ) statement1 [<b>else</b> statement2]</dt>
  <dd>The if statement evaluates the expression and executes statement1 or
      statement2 depending on the value of the expression. If the expression is
      non-zero, statement1 is executed. If statement2 is present and the value
      of the expression is 0, then statement2 is executed. (The else clause is
      an extension.)</dd>
  <dt><b>while</b> ( expression ) statement</dt>
  <dd>The while statement will execute the statement while the expression is
      non-zero. It evaluates the expression before each execution of the
      statement. Termination of the loop is caused by a zero expression value or
      the execution of a break statement.</dd>
  <dt><b>for</b> ( [expression1] ; [expression2] ; [expression3] )
    statement</dt>
  <dd>The for statement controls repeated execution of the statement.
      Expression1 is evaluated before the loop. Expression2 is evaluated before
      each execution of the statement. If it is non-zero, the statement is
      evaluated. If it is zero, the loop is terminated. After each execution of
      the statement, expression3 is evaluated before the reevaluation of
      expression2. If expression1 or expression3 are missing, nothing is
      evaluated at the point they would be evaluated. If expression2 is missing,
      it is the same as substituting the value 1 for expression2. (The optional
      expressions are an extension. POSIX <b>bc</b> requires all three
      expressions.) The following is equivalent code for the for statement:</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
expression1;
while (expression2) {
   statement;
   expression3;
}
</pre>
</div>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>break</b></dt>
  <dd>This statement causes a forced exit of the most recent enclosing while
      statement or for statement.</dd>
  <dt><b>continue</b></dt>
  <dd>The continue statement (an extension) causes the most recent enclosing for
      statement to start the next iteration.</dd>
  <dt><b>halt</b></dt>
  <dd>The halt statement (an extension) is an executed statement that causes the
      <b>bc</b> processor to quit only when it is executed. For example,
      &quot;if (0 == 1) halt&quot; will not cause <b>bc</b> to terminate because
      the halt is not executed.</dd>
  <dt><b>return</b></dt>
  <dd>Return the value 0 from a function. (See the section on functions.)</dd>
  <dt><b>return</b> ( expression )</dt>
  <dd>Return the value of the expression from a function. (See the section on
      functions.) As an extension, the parenthesis are not required.</dd>

Functions provide a method of defining a computation that can be executed later.
  Functions in <b>bc</b> always compute a value and return it to the caller.
  Function definitions are &quot;dynamic&quot; in the sense that a function is
  undefined until a definition is encountered in the input. That definition is
  then used until another definition function for the same name is encountered.
  The new definition then replaces the older definition. A function is defined
  as follows:
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b>define </b><i>name </i><b>( </b><i>parameters </i><b>) { </b><i>newline</i>
<i></i><i>    auto_list   statement_list </i><b>}</b>
</pre>
</div>
<pre>
</pre>
A function call is just an expression of the form
  &quot;<i>name</i><b>(</b><i>parameters</i><b>)</b>&quot;.
<p class="Pp">Parameters are numbers or arrays (an extension). In the function
    definition, zero or more parameters are defined by listing their names
    separated by commas. Numbers are only call by value parameters. Arrays are
    only call by variable. Arrays are specified in the parameter definition by
    the notation &quot;<i>name</i><b>[]</b>&quot;. In the function call, actual
    parameters are full expressions for number parameters. The same notation is
    used for passing arrays as for defining array parameters. The named array is
    passed by variable to the function. Since function definitions are dynamic,
    parameter numbers and types are checked when a function is called. Any
    mismatch in number or types of parameters will cause a runtime error. A
    runtime error will also occur for the call to an undefined function.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>auto_list</i> is an optional list of variables that are for
    &quot;local&quot; use. The syntax of the auto list (if present) is
    &quot;<b>auto</b> <b></b><i>name</i>, ... ;&quot;. (The semicolon is
    optional.) Each <i>name</i> is the name of an auto variable. Arrays may be
    specified by using the same notation as used in parameters. These variables
    have their values pushed onto a stack at the start of the function. The
    variables are then initialized to zero and used throughout the execution of
    the function. At function exit, these variables are popped so that the
    original value (at the time of the function call) of these variables are
    restored. The parameters are really auto variables that are initialized to a
    value provided in the function call. Auto variables are different than
    traditional local variables because if function A calls function B, B may
    access function A's auto variables by just using the same name, unless
    function B has called them auto variables. Due to the fact that auto
    variables and parameters are pushed onto a stack, <b>bc</b> supports
    recursive functions.</p>
<p class="Pp">The function body is a list of <b>bc</b> statements. Again,
    statements are separated by semicolons or newlines. Return statements cause
    the termination of a function and the return of a value. There are two
    versions of the return statement. The first form, &quot;<b>return</b>&quot;,
    returns the value 0 to the calling expression. The second form,
    &quot;<b>return ( </b><i>expression </i><b>)</b>&quot;, computes the value
    of the expression and returns that value to the calling expression. There is
    an implied &quot;<b>return (0)</b>&quot; at the end of every function. This
    allows a function to terminate and return 0 without an explicit return
    statement.</p>
<p class="Pp">Functions also change the usage of the variable <b>ibase</b>. All
    constants in the function body will be converted using the value of
    <b>ibase</b> at the time of the function call. Changes of <b>ibase</b> will
    be ignored during the execution of the function except for the standard
    function <b>read</b>, which will always use the current value of
    <b>ibase</b> for conversion of numbers.</p>
<p class="Pp">As an extension, the format of the definition has been slightly
    relaxed. The standard requires the opening brace be on the same line as the
    <b>define</b> keyword and all other parts must be on following lines. This
    version of <b>bc</b> will allow any number of newlines before and after the
    opening brace of the function. For example, the following definitions are
    legal.</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">

  AND LIBEDIT OPTIONS</a></h2>
GNU <b>bc</b> can be compiled (via a configure option) to use the GNU
  <b>readline</b> input editor library or the BSD <b>libedit</b> library. This
  allows the user to do editing of lines before sending them to <b>bc</b>. It
  also allows for a history of previous lines typed. When this option is
  selected, <b>bc</b> has one more special variable. This special variable,
  <b>history</b> is the number of lines of history retained. For
  <b>readline</b>, a value of -1 means that an unlimited number of history lines
  are retained. Setting the value of <b>history</b> to a positive number
  restricts the number of history lines to the number given. The value of 0
  disables the history feature. The default value is 100. For more information,
  read the user manuals for the GNU <b>readline</b>, <b>history</b> and BSD
  <b>libedit</b> libraries. One can not enable both <b>readline</b> and
  <b>libedit</b> at the same time.

<h2 class="Ss" id="DIFFERENCES"><a class="permalink" href="#DIFFERENCES">DIFFERENCES</a></h2>
This version of <b>bc</b> was implemented from the POSIX P1003.2/D11 draft and
  contains several differences and extensions relative to the draft and
  traditional implementations. It is not implemented in the traditional way
  using <i>dc(1).</i> This version is a single process which parses and runs a
  byte code translation of the program. There is an &quot;undocumented&quot;
  option (-c) that causes the program to output the byte code to the standard
  output instead of running it. It was mainly used for debugging the parser and
  preparing the math library.
<p class="Pp">A major source of differences is extensions, where a feature is
    extended to add more functionality and additions, where new features are
    added. The following is the list of differences and extensions.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>LANG</dt>
  <dd>This version does not conform to the POSIX standard in the processing of
      the LANG environment variable and all environment variables starting with
      LC_.</dd>
  <dt>names</dt>
  <dd>Traditional and POSIX <b>bc</b> have single letter names for functions,
      variables and arrays. They have been extended to be multi-character names
      that start with a letter and may contain letters, numbers and the
      underscore character.</dd>
  <dt>Strings</dt>
  <dd>Strings are not allowed to contain NUL characters. POSIX says all
      characters must be included in strings.</dd>
  <dt>last</dt>
  <dd>POSIX <b>bc</b> does not have a <b>last</b> variable. Some implementations
      of <b>bc</b> use the period (.) in a similar way.</dd>
  <dt>comparisons</dt>
  <dd>POSIX <b>bc</b> allows comparisons only in the if statement, the while
      statement, and the second expression of the for statement. Also, only one
      relational operation is allowed in each of those statements.</dd>
  <dt>if statement, else clause</dt>
  <dd>POSIX <b>bc</b> does not have an else clause.</dd>
  <dt>for statement</dt>
  <dd>POSIX <b>bc</b> requires all expressions to be present in the for
      statement.</dd>
  <dt>&amp;&amp;, ||, !</dt>
  <dd>POSIX <b>bc</b> does not have the logical operators.</dd>
  <dt>read function</dt>
  <dd>POSIX <b>bc</b> does not have a read function.</dd>
  <dt>print statement</dt>
  <dd>POSIX <b>bc</b> does not have a print statement .</dd>
  <dt>continue statement</dt>
  <dd>POSIX <b>bc</b> does not have a continue statement.</dd>
  <dt>return statement</dt>
  <dd>POSIX <b>bc</b> requires parentheses around the return expression.</dd>
  <dt>array parameters</dt>
  <dd>POSIX <b>bc</b> does not (currently) support array parameters in full. The
      POSIX grammar allows for arrays in function definitions, but does not
      provide a method to specify an array as an actual parameter. (This is most
      likely an oversight in the grammar.) Traditional implementations of
      <b>bc</b> have only call by value array parameters.</dd>
  <dt>function format</dt>
  <dd>POSIX <b>bc</b> requires the opening brace on the same line as the
      <b>define</b> key word and the <b>auto</b> statement on the next
    line.</dd>
  <dt>=+, =-, =*, =/, =%, =^</dt>
  <dd>POSIX <b>bc</b> does not require these &quot;old style&quot; assignment
      operators to be defined. This version may allow these &quot;old
      style&quot; assignments. Use the limits statement to see if the installed
      version supports them. If it does support the &quot;old style&quot;
      assignment operators, the statement &quot;a =- 1&quot; will decrement
      <b>a</b> by 1 instead of setting <b>a</b> to the value -1.</dd>
  <dt>spaces in numbers</dt>
  <dd>Other implementations of <b>bc</b> allow spaces in numbers. For example,
      &quot;x=1 3&quot; would assign the value 13 to the variable x. The same
      statement would cause a syntax error in this version of <b>bc</b>.</dd>
  <dt>errors and execution</dt>
  <dd>This implementation varies from other implementations in terms of what
      code will be executed when syntax and other errors are found in the
      program. If a syntax error is found in a function definition, error
      recovery tries to find the beginning of a statement and continue to parse
      the function. Once a syntax error is found in the function, the function
      will not be callable and becomes undefined. Syntax errors in the
      interactive execution code will invalidate the current execution block.
      The execution block is terminated by an end of line that appears after a
      complete sequence of statements. For example,</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
a = 1
b = 2
</pre>
</div>
<pre>
</pre>
has two execution blocks and
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
{ a = 1
  b = 2 }
</pre>
</div>
<pre>
</pre>
has one execution block. Any runtime error will terminate the execution of the
  current execution block. A runtime warning will not terminate the current
  execution block.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>Interrupts</dt>
  <dd>During an interactive session, the SIGINT signal (usually generated by the
      control-C character from the terminal) will cause execution of the current
      execution block to be interrupted. It will display a &quot;runtime&quot;
      error indicating which function was interrupted. After all runtime
      structures have been cleaned up, a message will be printed to notify the
      user that <b>bc</b> is ready for more input. All previously defined
      functions remain defined and the value of all non-auto variables are the
      value at the point of interruption. All auto variables and function
      parameters are removed during the clean up process. During a
      non-interactive session, the SIGINT signal will terminate the entire run
      of <b>bc</b>.</dd>

  <dt>BC_ENV_ARGS</dt>
  <dd>This is another mechanism to get arguments to <b>bc</b>. The format is the
      same as the command line arguments. These arguments are processed first,
      so any files listed in the environent arguments are processed before any
      command line argument files. This allows the user to set up
      &quot;standard&quot; options and files to be processed at every invocation
      of <b>bc</b>. The files in the environment variables would typically
      contain function definitions for functions the user wants defined every
      time <b>bc</b> is run.</dd>
