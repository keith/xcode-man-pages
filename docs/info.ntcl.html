   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

<p class="Pp">This command provides information about various internals of the
    Tcl interpreter. The legal <i>option</i>s (which may be abbreviated)
  are:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="info"><a class="permalink" href="#info"><b>info args
    </b><i>procname</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Returns a list containing the names of the arguments to procedure
      <i>procname</i>, in order. <i>Procname</i> must be the name of a Tcl
      command procedure.</dd>
  <dt id="info~2"><a class="permalink" href="#info~2"><b>info body
    </b><i>procname</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Returns the body of procedure <i>procname</i>. <i>Procname</i> must be the
      name of a Tcl command procedure.</dd>
  <dt id="info~3"><a class="permalink" href="#info~3"><b>info
    cmdcount</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Returns a count of the total number of commands that have been invoked in
      this interpreter.</dd>
  <dt id="info~4"><a class="permalink" href="#info~4"><b>info commands
    </b>?<i>pattern</i>?</a></dt>
  <dd>If <i>pattern</i> is not specified, returns a list of names of all the Tcl
      commands visible (i.e. executable without using a qualified name) to the
      current namespace, including both the built-in commands written in C and
      the command procedures defined using the <b>proc</b> command. If
      <i>pattern</i> is specified, only those names matching <i>pattern</i> are
      returned. Matching is determined using the same rules as for <b>string
      match</b>. <i>pattern</i> can be a qualified name like <b>Foo::print*</b>.
      That is, it may specify a particular namespace using a sequence of
      namespace names separated by double colons (<b>::</b>), and may have
      pattern matching special characters at the end to specify a set of
      commands in that namespace. If <i>pattern</i> is a qualified name, the
      resulting list of command names has each one qualified with the name of
      the specified namespace, and only the commands defined in the named
      namespace are returned.</dd>
  <dt id="info~5"><a class="permalink" href="#info~5"><b>info complete
    </b><i>command</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Returns 1 if <i>command</i> is a complete Tcl command in the sense of
      having no unclosed quotes, braces, brackets or array element names. If the
      command does not appear to be complete then 0 is returned. This command is
      typically used in line-oriented input environments to allow users to type
      in commands that span multiple lines; if the command is not complete, the
      script can delay evaluating it until additional lines have been typed to
      complete the command.</dd>
  <dt id="info~6"><a class="permalink" href="#info~6"><b>info default
    </b><i>procname arg varname</i></a></dt>
  <dd><i>Procname</i> must be the name of a Tcl command procedure and <i>arg</i>
      must be the name of an argument to that procedure. If <i>arg</i> does not
      have a default value then the command returns <b>0</b>. Otherwise it
      returns <b>1</b> and places the default value of <i>arg</i> into variable
      <i>varname</i>.</dd>
  <dt id="info~7"><a class="permalink" href="#info~7"><b>info exists
    </b><i>varName</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Returns <b>1</b> if the variable named <i>varName</i> exists in the
      current context (either as a global or local variable) and has been
      defined by being given a value, returns <b>0</b> otherwise.</dd>
  <dt id="info~8"><a class="permalink" href="#info~8"><b>info frame</b>
    ?<i>number</i>?</a></dt>
  <dd>This command provides access to all frames on the stack, even those hidden
      from <b>info level</b>. If <i>number</i> is not specified, this command
      returns a number giving the frame level of the command. This is 1 if the
      command is invoked at top-level. If <i>number</i> is specified, then the
      result is a dictionary containing the location information for the command
      at the <i>number</i>ed level on the stack.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">If <i>number</i> is positive (&gt; 0) then it selects a particular
    stack level (1 refers to the top-most active command, i.e., <b>info
    frame</b> itself, 2 to the command it was called from, and so on); otherwise
    it gives a level relative to the current command (0 refers to the current
    command, i.e., <b>info frame</b> itself, -1 to its caller, and so on).</p>
<p class="Pp">This is similar to how <b>info level</b> works, except that this
    subcommand reports all frames, like <b>source</b>d scripts, <b>eval</b>s,
    <b>uplevel</b>s, etc.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that for nested commands, like &#x201C;foo [bar [x]]&#x201D;,
    only &#x201C;x&#x201D; will be seen by an <b>info frame</b> invoked within
    &#x201C;x&#x201D;. This is the same as for <b>info level</b> and error stack
    traces.</p>
<p class="Pp">The result dictionary may contain the keys listed below, with the
    specified meanings for their values:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="type"><a class="permalink" href="#type"><b>type</b></a></dt>
  <dd>This entry is always present and describes the nature of the location for
      the command. The recognized values are <b>source</b>, <b>proc</b>,
      <b>eval</b>, and <b>precompiled</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="source"><a class="permalink" href="#source"><b>source</b>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;</a></dt>
  <dd>means that the command is found in a script loaded by the <b>source</b>
      command.</dd>
  <dt id="proc"><a class="permalink" href="#proc"><b>proc</b>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;</a></dt>
  <dd>means that the command is found in dynamically created procedure
    body.</dd>
  <dt id="eval"><a class="permalink" href="#eval"><b>eval</b>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;</a></dt>
  <dd>means that the command is executed by <b>eval</b> or <b>uplevel</b>.</dd>
  <dt id="precompiled"><a class="permalink" href="#precompiled"><b>precompiled</b>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;</a></dt>
  <dd>means that the command is found in a precompiled script (loadable by the
      package <b>tbcload</b>), and no further information will be
    available.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="line"><a class="permalink" href="#line"><b>line</b></a></dt>
  <dd>This entry provides the number of the line the command is at inside of the
      script it is a part of. This information is not present for type
      <b>precompiled</b>. For type <b>source</b> this information is counted
      relative to the beginning of the file, whereas for the last two types the
      line is counted relative to the start of the script.</dd>
  <dt id="file"><a class="permalink" href="#file"><b>file</b></a></dt>
  <dd>This entry is present only for type <b>source</b>. It provides the
      normalized path of the file the command is in.</dd>
  <dt id="cmd"><a class="permalink" href="#cmd"><b>cmd</b></a></dt>
  <dd>This entry provides the string representation of the command. This is
      usually the unsubstituted form, however for commands which are a pure list
      executed by eval it is the substituted form as they have no other string
      representation. Care is taken that the pure-List property of the latter is
      not spoiled.</dd>
  <dt id="proc~2"><a class="permalink" href="#proc~2"><b>proc</b></a></dt>
  <dd>This entry is present only if the command is found in the body of a
      regular Tcl procedure. It then provides the name of that procedure.</dd>
  <dt id="lambda"><a class="permalink" href="#lambda"><b>lambda</b></a></dt>
  <dd>This entry is present only if the command is found in the body of an
      anonymous Tcl procedure, i.e. a lambda. It then provides the entire
      definition of the lambda in question.</dd>
  <dt id="level"><a class="permalink" href="#level"><b>level</b></a></dt>
  <dd>This entry is present only if the queried frame has a corresponding frame
      returned by <b>info level</b>. It provides the index of this frame,
      relative to the current level (0 and negative numbers).</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">A thing of note is that for procedures statically defined in files
    the locations of commands in their bodies will be reported with type
    <b>source</b> and absolute line numbers, and not as type <b>proc</b>. The
    same is true for procedures nested in statically defined procedures, and
    literal eval scripts in files or statically defined procedures.</p>
<p class="Pp">In contrast, a procedure definition or <b>eval</b> within a
    dynamically <b>eval</b>uated environment count linenumbers relative to the
    start of their script, even if they would be able to count relative to the
    start of the outer dynamic script. That type of number usually makes more
    sense.</p>
<p class="Pp">A different way of describing this behaviour is that file based
    locations are tracked as deeply as possible, and where this is not possible
    the lines are counted based on the smallest possible <b>eval</b> or
    procedure body, as that scope is usually easier to find than any dynamic
    outer scope.</p>
<p class="Pp">The syntactic form <b>{*}</b> is handled like <b>eval</b>. I.e. if
    it is given a literal list argument the system tracks the linenumber within
    the list words as well, and otherwise all linenumbers are counted relative
    to the start of each word (smallest scope)</p>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="info~9"><a class="permalink" href="#info~9"><b>info functions
    </b>?<i>pattern</i>?</a></dt>
  <dd>If <i>pattern</i> is not specified, returns a list of all the math
      functions currently defined. If <i>pattern</i> is specified, only those
      functions whose name matches <i>pattern</i> are returned. Matching is
      determined using the same rules as for <b>string match</b>.</dd>
  <dt id="info~10"><a class="permalink" href="#info~10"><b>info globals
    </b>?<i>pattern</i>?</a></dt>
  <dd>If <i>pattern</i> is not specified, returns a list of all the names of
      currently-defined global variables. Global variables are variables in the
      global namespace. If <i>pattern</i> is specified, only those names
      matching <i>pattern</i> are returned. Matching is determined using the
      same rules as for <b>string match</b>.</dd>
  <dt id="info~11"><a class="permalink" href="#info~11"><b>info
    hostname</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Returns the name of the computer on which this invocation is being
      executed. Note that this name is not guaranteed to be the fully qualified
      domain name of the host. Where machines have several different names (as
      is common on systems with both TCP/IP (DNS) and NetBIOS-based networking
      installed,) it is the name that is suitable for TCP/IP networking that is
      returned.</dd>
  <dt id="info~12"><a class="permalink" href="#info~12"><b>info level</b>
    ?<i>number</i>?</a></dt>
  <dd>If <i>number</i> is not specified, this command returns a number giving
      the stack level of the invoking procedure, or 0 if the command is invoked
      at top-level. If <i>number</i> is specified, then the result is a list
      consisting of the name and arguments for the procedure call at level
      <i>number</i> on the stack. If <i>number</i> is positive then it selects a
      particular stack level (1 refers to the top-most active procedure, 2 to
      the procedure it called, and so on); otherwise it gives a level relative
      to the current level (0 refers to the current procedure, -1 to its caller,
      and so on). See the <b>uplevel</b> command for more information on what
      stack levels mean.</dd>
  <dt id="info~13"><a class="permalink" href="#info~13"><b>info
    library</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Returns the name of the library directory in which standard Tcl scripts
      are stored. This is actually the value of the <b>tcl_library</b> variable
      and may be changed by setting <b>tcl_library</b>. See the <b>tclvars</b>
      manual entry for more information.</dd>
  <dt id="info~14"><a class="permalink" href="#info~14"><b>info loaded
    </b>?<i>interp</i>?</a></dt>
  <dd>Returns a list describing all of the packages that have been loaded into
      <i>interp</i> with the <b>load</b> command. Each list element is a
      sub-list with two elements consisting of the name of the file from which
      the package was loaded and the name of the package. For statically-loaded
      packages the file name will be an empty string. If <i>interp</i> is
      omitted then information is returned for all packages loaded in any
      interpreter in the process. To get a list of just the packages in the
      current interpreter, specify an empty string for the <i>interp</i>
      argument.</dd>
  <dt id="info~15"><a class="permalink" href="#info~15"><b>info locals
    </b>?<i>pattern</i>?</a></dt>
  <dd>If <i>pattern</i> is not specified, returns a list of all the names of
      currently-defined local variables, including arguments to the current
      procedure, if any. Variables defined with the <b>global</b>, <b>upvar</b>
      and <b>variable</b> commands will not be returned. If <i>pattern</i> is
      specified, only those names matching <i>pattern</i> are returned. Matching
      is determined using the same rules as for <b>string match</b>.</dd>
  <dt id="info~16"><a class="permalink" href="#info~16"><b>info
    nameofexecutable</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Returns the full path name of the binary file from which the application
      was invoked. If Tcl was unable to identify the file, then an empty string
      is returned.</dd>
  <dt id="info~17"><a class="permalink" href="#info~17"><b>info
    patchlevel</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Returns the value of the global variable <b>tcl_patchLevel</b>; see the
      <b>tclvars</b> manual entry for more information.</dd>
  <dt id="info~18"><a class="permalink" href="#info~18"><b>info procs
    </b>?<i>pattern</i>?</a></dt>
  <dd>If <i>pattern</i> is not specified, returns a list of all the names of Tcl
      command procedures in the current namespace. If <i>pattern</i> is
      specified, only those procedure names in the current namespace matching
      <i>pattern</i> are returned. Matching is determined using the same rules
      as for <b>string match</b>. If <i>pattern</i> contains any namespace
      separators, they are used to select a namespace relative to the current
      namespace (or relative to the global namespace if <i>pattern</i> starts
      with <b>::</b>) to match within; the matching pattern is taken to be the
      part after the last namespace separator.</dd>
  <dt id="info~19"><a class="permalink" href="#info~19"><b>info script</b>
    ?<i>filename</i>?</a></dt>
  <dd>If a Tcl script file is currently being evaluated (i.e. there is a call to
      <b>Tcl_EvalFile</b> active or there is an active invocation of the
      <b>source</b> command), then this command returns the name of the
      innermost file being processed. If <i>filename</i> is specified, then the
      return value of this command will be modified for the duration of the
      active invocation to return that name. This is useful in virtual file
      system applications. Otherwise the command returns an empty string.</dd>
  <dt id="info~20"><a class="permalink" href="#info~20"><b>info
    sharedlibextension</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Returns the extension used on this platform for the names of files
      containing shared libraries (for example, <b>.so</b> under Solaris). If
      shared libraries are not supported on this platform then an empty string
      is returned.</dd>
  <dt id="info~21"><a class="permalink" href="#info~21"><b>info
    tclversion</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Returns the value of the global variable <b>tcl_version</b>; see the
      <b>tclvars</b> manual entry for more information.</dd>
  <dt id="info~22"><a class="permalink" href="#info~22"><b>info vars</b>
    ?<i>pattern</i>?</a></dt>
  <dd>If <i>pattern</i> is not specified, returns a list of all the names of
      currently-visible variables. This includes locals and currently-visible
      globals. If <i>pattern</i> is specified, only those names matching
      <i>pattern</i> are returned. Matching is determined using the same rules
      as for <b>string match</b>. <i>pattern</i> can be a qualified name like
      <b>Foo::option*</b>. That is, it may specify a particular namespace using
      a sequence of namespace names separated by double colons (<b>::</b>), and
      may have pattern matching special characters at the end to specify a set
      of variables in that namespace. If <i>pattern</i> is a qualified name, the
      resulting list of variable names has each matching namespace variable
      qualified with the name of its namespace. Note that a currently-visible
      variable may not yet &#x201C;exist&#x201D; if it has not been set (e.g. a
      variable declared but not set by <b>variable</b>).</dd>
