Returns a pointer to a filled in static struct with information about various
  features in the running version of libcurl. <i>age</i> should be set to the
  version of this functionality by the time you write your program. This way,
  libcurl will always return a proper struct that your program understands,
  while programs in the future might get a different struct.
  <b>CURLVERSION_NOW</b> will be the most recent one for the library you have
  installed:
<p class="Pp">
   data = curl_version_info(CURLVERSION_NOW);</p>
<p class="Pp">Applications should use this information to judge if things are
    possible to do or not, instead of using compile-time checks, as dynamic/DLL
    libraries can be changed independent of applications.</p>
<p class="Pp">The curl_version_info_data struct looks like this</p>

<p class="Pp"><i>age</i> describes what the age of this struct is. The number
    depends on how new the libcurl you're using is. You are however guaranteed
    to get a struct that you have a matching struct for in the header, as you
    tell libcurl your &quot;age&quot; with the input argument.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>version</i> is just an ascii string for the libcurl
  version.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>version_num</i> is a 24 bit number created like this: &lt;8
    bits major number&gt; | &lt;8 bits minor number&gt; | &lt;8 bits patch
    number&gt;. Version 7.9.8 is therefore returned as 0x070908.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>host</i> is an ascii string showing what host information that
    this libcurl was built for. As discovered by a configure script or set by
    the build environment.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>features</i> can have none, one or more bits set, and the
    currently defined bits are:</p>

  <dd>HTTP Alt-Svc parsing and the associated options (Added in 7.64.1)</dd>
  <dt>CURL_VERSION_ASYNCHDNS</dt>
  <dd>libcurl was built with support for asynchronous name lookups, which allows
      more exact timeouts (even on Windows) and less blocking when using the
      multi interface. (added in 7.10.7)</dd>
  <dt>CURL_VERSION_BROTLI</dt>
  <dd>supports HTTP Brotli content encoding using libbrotlidec (Added in

  <dd>libcurl was built with support for SPNEGO authentication (Simple and
      Protected GSS-API Negotiation Mechanism, defined in RFC 2478.) (added in

  <dd>supports SSL (HTTPS/FTPS) (Added in 7.10)</dd>
  <dt>CURL_VERSION_SSPI</dt>
  <dd>libcurl was built with support for SSPI. This is only available on Windows
      and makes libcurl use Windows-provided functions for Kerberos, NTLM,
      SPNEGO and Digest authentication. It also allows libcurl to use the
      current user credentials without the app having to pass them on. (Added in
      7.13.2)</dd>

<i>ssl_version</i> is an ASCII string for the TLS library name + version used.
  If libcurl has no SSL support, this is NULL. For example &quot;Schannel&quot;,
  &quot;SecureTransport&quot; or &quot;OpenSSL/1.1.0g&quot;.
<p class="Pp"><i>ssl_version_num</i> is always 0.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>libz_version</i> is an ASCII string (there is no numerical
    version). If libcurl has no libz support, this is NULL.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>protocols</i> is a pointer to an array of char * pointers,
    containing the names protocols that libcurl supports (using lowercase
    letters). The protocol names are the same as would be used in URLs. The
    array is terminated by a NULL entry.</p>
