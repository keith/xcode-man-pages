<p class="Pp">Returns a pointer to a filled in static struct with information
    about various features in the running version of libcurl. <i>age</i> should
    be set to the version of this functionality by the time you write your
    program. This way, libcurl will always return a proper struct that your
    program understands, while programs in the future might get a different
    struct. <b>CURLVERSION_NOW</b> will be the most recent one for the library
    you have installed:</p>
<pre>
<br/>
  data = curl_version_info(CURLVERSION_NOW);</pre>
<p class="Pp">Applications should use this information to judge if things are
    possible to do or not, instead of using compile-time checks, as dynamic/DLL
    libraries can be changed independent of applications.</p>
<p class="Pp">This function can alter the returned static data as long as
    <i>curl_global_init</i> has not been called. It is therefore not thread-safe
    before libcurl initialization occurs.</p>

<p class="Pp"><i>age</i> describes what the age of this struct is. The number
    depends on how new the libcurl you are using is. You are however guaranteed
    to get a struct that you have a matching struct for in the header, as you
    tell libcurl your &quot;age&quot; with the input argument.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>version</i> is just an ascii string for the libcurl
  version.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>version_num</i> is a 24 bit number created like this: &lt;8
    bits major number&gt; | &lt;8 bits minor number&gt; | &lt;8 bits patch
    number&gt;. Version 7.9.8 is therefore returned as 0x070908.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>host</i> is an ascii string showing what host information that
    this libcurl was built for. As discovered by a configure script or set by
    the build environment.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>features</i> is a bit mask representing available features. It
    can have none, one or more bits set. The use of this field is deprecated:
    use <i>feature_names</i> instead. The feature names description below lists
    the associated bits.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>feature_names</i> is a pointer to an array of string pointers,
    containing the names of the features that libcurl supports. The array is
    terminated by a NULL entry. Currently defined names are:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
