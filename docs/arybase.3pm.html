   Set up some character translations and predefined strings.  \*(-- will
   give an unbreakable dash, \*(PI will give pi, \*(L" will give a left
   double quote, and \*(R" will give a right double quote.  \*(C+ will
   give a nicer C++.  Capital omega is used to do unbreakable dashes and
   therefore won't be available.  \*(C` and \*(C' expand to `' in nroff,
   nothing in troff, for use with C<>.

This module implements Perl's <span class="Li">$[</span> variable. You should
  not use it directly.
<p class="Pp">Assigning to <span class="Li">$[</span> has the
    <i>compile-time</i> effect of making the assigned value, converted to an
    integer, the index of the first element in an array and the first character
    in a substring, within the enclosing lexical scope.</p>
<p class="Pp">It can be written with or without
    <span class="Li">&quot;local&quot;</span>:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    $[ = 1;
    local $[ = 1;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">It only works if the assignment can be detected at compile time
    and the value assigned is constant.</p>
<p class="Pp">It affects the following operations:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    $array[$element]
    @array[@slice]
    $#array
    (list())[$slice]
    splice @array, $index, ...
    each @array
    keys @array

    index $string, $substring  # return value is affected
    pos $string
    substr $string, $offset, ...
</pre>
<p class="Pp">As with the default base of 0, negative bases count from the end
    of the array or string, starting with -1. If <span class="Li">$[</span> is a
    positive integer, indices from <span class="Li">&quot;$[-1&quot;</span> to 0
    also count from the end. If <span class="Li">$[</span> is negative (why
    would you do that, though?), indices from <span class="Li">$[</span> to 0
    count from the beginning of the string, but indices below
    <span class="Li">$[</span> count from the end of the string as though the
    base were 0.</p>
<p class="Pp">Prior to Perl 5.16, indices from 0 to
    <span class="Li">&quot;$[-1&quot;</span> inclusive, for positive values of
    <span class="Li">$[</span>, behaved differently for different operations;
    negative indices equal to or greater than a negative
    <span class="Li">$[</span> likewise behaved inconsistently.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="HISTORY"><a class="permalink" href="#HISTORY">HISTORY</a></h1>
Before Perl 5, <span class="Li">$[</span> was a global variable that affected
  all array indices and string offsets.
<p class="Pp">Starting with Perl 5, it became a file-scoped compile-time
    directive, which could be made lexically-scoped with
    <span class="Li">&quot;local&quot;</span>. &quot;File-scoped&quot; means
    that the <span class="Li">$[</span> assignment could leak out of the block
    in which occurred:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    {
        $[ = 1;
        # ... array base is 1 here ...
    }
    # ... still 1, but not in other files ...
</pre>
<p class="Pp">In Perl 5.10, it became strictly lexical. The file-scoped
    behaviour was removed (perhaps inadvertently, but what's done is done).</p>
<p class="Pp">In Perl 5.16, the implementation was moved into this module, and
    out of the Perl core. The erratic behaviour that occurred with indices
    between -1 and <span class="Li">$[</span> was made consistent between
    operations, and, for negative bases, indices from <span class="Li">$[</span>
    to -1 inclusive were made consistent between operations.</p>

Error messages that mention array indices use the 0-based index.
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;keys $arrayref&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;each $arrayref&quot;</span> do not respect the
    current value of <span class="Li">$[</span>.</p>
