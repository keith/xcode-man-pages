   The definitions below are for supplemental macros used in Tcl/Tk
   manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget.  The
  	options follow on successive lines, in four columns separated
  	by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   RCS: @(#) $Id: man.macros,v 1.1 2009/01/30 04:56:47 andreas_kupries Exp $
  
  	# Set up traps and other miscellaneous stuff for Tcl/Tk man pages.
  	# Start an argument description
  .b
  	# define tabbing values for .AP
  
  	# BS - start boxed text
  	# ^y = starting y location
  	# ^b = 1
  	# BE - end boxed text (draw box now)
  	Draw four-sided box normally, but don't draw top of
  	box if the box started on an earlier page.
  	# VS - start vertical sidebar
  	# ^Y = starting y location
  	# ^v = 1 (for troff;  for nroff this doesn't matter)
  	# VE - end of vertical sidebar
  	# Special macro to handle page bottom:  finish off current
  	# box/sidebar if in box/sidebar mode, then invoked standard
  	# page bottom macro.
  	Draw three-sided box if this is the box's first page,
  	draw two sides but no top otherwise.
  	# DS - begin display
  	# DE - end display
  	# SO - start of list of standard options
  	# SE - end of list of standard options
  	# OP - start of full description for a single option
  	# CS - begin code excerpt
  	# CE - end code excerpt

This package provides a single utility command which takes an AST for a parsing
  expression grammar and normalizes it in various ways. The result is called a
  <i>Normalized PE Grammar Tree</i>.
<p class="Pp"><i>Note</i> that this package can only be used from within a
    plugin managed by the package <b>page::pluginmgr</b>.</p>

  <dd>This command assumes the <i>tree</i> object contains for a parsing
      expression grammar. It normalizes this tree in place. The result is called
      a <i>Normalized PE Grammar Tree</i>.
    <p class="Pp">The following operations are performd</p>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>[1]</dt>
  <dd>The data for all terminals is stored in their grandparental nodes. The
      terminal nodes and their parents are removed. Type information is
    dropped.</dd>
  <dt>[2]</dt>
  <dd>All nodes which have exactly one child are irrelevant and are removed,
      with the exception of the root node. The immediate child of the root is
      irrelevant as well, and removed as well.</dd>
  <dt>[3]</dt>
  <dd>The name of the grammar is moved from the tree node it is stored in to an
      attribute of the root node, and the tree node removed.
    <p class="Pp">The node keeping the start expression separate is removed as
        irrelevant and the root node of the start expression tagged with a
        marker attribute, and its handle saved in an attribute of the root node
        for quick access.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>[4]</dt>
  <dd>Nonterminal hint information is moved from nodes into attributes, and the
      now irrelevant nodes are deleted.
    <p class="Pp"><i>Note:</i> This transformation is dependent on the removal
        of all nodes with exactly one child, as it removes the all 'Attribute'
        nodes already. Otherwise this transformation would have to put the
        information into the grandparental node.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The default mode given to the nonterminals is
      <b>value</b>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Like with the global metadata definition specific information
        is moved out out of nodes into attributes, the now irrelevant nodes are
        deleted, and the root nodes of all definitions are tagged with marker
        attributes. This provides us with a mapping from nonterminal names to
        their defining nodes as well, which is saved in an attribute of the root
        node for quick reference.</p>
    <p class="Pp">At last the range in the input covered by a definition is
        computed. The left extent comes from the terminal for the nonterminal
        symbol it defines. The right extent comes from the rightmost child under
        the definition. While this not an expression tree yet the location data
        is sound already.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>[5]</dt>
  <dd>The remaining nodes under all definitions are transformed into proper
      expression trees. First character ranges, followed by unary operations,
      characters, and nonterminals. At last the tree is flattened by the removal
      of superfluous inner nodes.
    <p class="Pp">The order matters, to shed as much nodes as possible early,
        and to avoid unnecessary work later.</p>
