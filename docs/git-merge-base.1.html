<i>git merge-base</i> finds best common ancestor(s) between two commits to use
  in a three-way merge. One common ancestor is <i>better</i> than another common
  ancestor if the latter is an ancestor of the former. A common ancestor that
  does not have any better common ancestor is a <i>best common ancestor</i>,
  i.e. a <i>merge base</i>. Note that there can be more than one merge base for
  a pair of commits.

As the most common special case, specifying only two commits on the command line
  means computing the merge base between the given two commits.
<p class="Pp">More generally, among the two commits to compute the merge base
    from, one is specified by the first commit argument on the command line; the
    other commit is a (possibly hypothetical) commit that is a merge across all
    the remaining commits on the command line.</p>
<p class="Pp">As a consequence, the <i>merge base</i> is not necessarily
    contained in each of the commit arguments if more than two commits are
    specified. This is different from <b>git-show-branch</b>(1) when used with
    the <b>--merge-base</b> option.</p>
<p class="Pp">--octopus</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Compute the best common ancestors of all supplied
  commits, in preparation for an n-way merge. This mimics the behavior of <i>git
  show-branch --merge-base</i>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--independent</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Instead of printing merge bases, print a minimal subset
  of the supplied commits with the same ancestors. In other words, among the
  commits given, list those which cannot be reached from any other. This mimics
  the behavior of <i>git show-branch --independent</i>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--is-ancestor</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Check if the first &lt;commit&gt; is an ancestor of the
  second &lt;commit&gt;, and exit with status 0 if true, or with status 1 if
  not. Errors are signaled by a non-zero status that is not 1.</div>
<p class="Pp">--fork-point</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Find the point at which a branch (or any history that
  leads to &lt;commit&gt;) forked from another branch (or any reference)
  &lt;ref&gt;. This does not just look for the common ancestor of the two
  commits, but also takes into account the reflog of &lt;ref&gt; to see if the
  history leading to &lt;commit&gt; forked from an earlier incarnation of the
  branch &lt;ref&gt; (see discussion on this mode below).</div>

Given two commits <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, <b>git merge-base A B</b> will output a
  commit which is reachable from both <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> through the parent
  relationship.
<p class="Pp">For example, with this topology:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
         o---o---o---B
        /
---o---1---o---o---o---A
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">the merge base between <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> is <i>1</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Given three commits <i>A</i>, <i>B</i> and <i>C</i>, <b>git
    merge-base A B C</b> will compute the merge base between <i>A</i> and a
    hypothetical commit <i>M</i>, which is a merge between <i>B</i> and
    <i>C</i>. For example, with this topology:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
       o---o---o---o---C
      /
     /   o---o---o---B
    /   /
---2---1---o---o---o---A
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">the result of <b>git merge-base A B C</b> is <i>1</i>. This is
    because the equivalent topology with a merge commit <i>M</i> between
    <i>B</i> and <i>C</i> is:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
       o---o---o---o---o
      /                 \
     /   o---o---o---o---M
    /   /
---2---1---o---o---o---A
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">and the result of <b>git merge-base A M</b> is <i>1</i>. Commit
    <i>2</i> is also a common ancestor between <i>A</i> and <i>M</i>, but
    <i>1</i> is a better common ancestor, because <i>2</i> is an ancestor of
    <i>1</i>. Hence, <i>2</i> is not a merge base.</p>
<p class="Pp">The result of <b>git merge-base --octopus A B C</b> is <i>2</i>,
    because <i>2</i> is the best common ancestor of all commits.</p>
<p class="Pp">When the history involves criss-cross merges, there can be more
    than one <i>best</i> common ancestor for two commits. For example, with this
    topology:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
---1---o---A
    \ /
     X
    / \
---2---o---o---B
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">both <i>1</i> and <i>2</i> are merge-bases of A and B. Neither one
    is better than the other (both are <i>best</i> merge bases). When the
    <b>--all</b> option is not given, it is unspecified which best one is
    output.</p>
<p class="Pp">A common idiom to check &quot;fast-forward-ness&quot; between two
    commits A and B is (or at least used to be) to compute the merge base
    between A and B, and check if it is the same as A, in which case, A is an
    ancestor of B. You will see this idiom used often in older scripts.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
A=$(git rev-parse --verify A)
if test &quot;$A&quot; = &quot;$(git merge-base A B)&quot;
then
        ... A is an ancestor of B ...
fi
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">In modern git, you can say this in a more direct way:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
if git merge-base --is-ancestor A B
then
        ... A is an ancestor of B ...
fi
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">instead.</p>

After working on the <b>topic</b> branch created with <b>git switch -c topic
  origin/master</b>, the history of remote-tracking branch <b>origin/master</b>
  may have been rewound and rebuilt, leading to a history of this shape:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
                 o---B2
                /
---o---o---B1--o---o---o---B (origin/master)
        \
         B0
          \
           D0---D1---D (topic)
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">where <b>origin/master</b> used to point at commits B0, B1, B2 and
    now it points at B, and your <b>topic</b> branch was started on top of it
    back when <b>origin/master</b> was at B0, and you built three commits, D0,
    D1, and D, on top of it. Imagine that you now want to rebase the work you
    did on the topic on top of the updated origin/master.</p>
<p class="Pp">In such a case, <b>git merge-base origin/master topic</b> would
    return the parent of B0 in the above picture, but B0^..D is <b>not</b> the
    range of commits you would want to replay on top of B (it includes B0, which
    is not what you wrote; it is a commit the other side discarded when it moved
    its tip from B0 to B1).</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>git merge-base --fork-point origin/master topic</b> is designed
    to help in such a case. It takes not only B but also B0, B1, and B2 (i.e.
    old tips of the remote-tracking branches your repository&#x2019;s reflog
    knows about) into account to see on which commit your topic branch was built
    and finds B0, allowing you to replay only the commits on your topic,
    excluding the commits the other side later discarded.</p>
<p class="Pp">Hence</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ fork_point=$(git merge-base --fork-point origin/master topic)
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">will find B0, and</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ git rebase --onto origin/master $fork_point topic
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">will replay D0, D1 and D on top of B to create a new history of
    this shape:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
                 o---B2
                /
---o---o---B1--o---o---o---B (origin/master)
        \                   \
         B0                  D0'--D1'--D' (topic - updated)
          \
           D0---D1---D (topic - old)
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">A caveat is that older reflog entries in your repository may be
    expired by <b>git gc</b>. If B0 no longer appears in the reflog of the
    remote-tracking branch <b>origin/master</b>, the <b>--fork-point</b> mode
    obviously cannot find it and fails, avoiding to give a random and useless
    result (such as the parent of B0, like the same command without the
    <b>--fork-point</b> option gives).</p>
<p class="Pp">Also, the remote-tracking branch you use the <b>--fork-point</b>
    mode with must be the one your topic forked from its tip. If you forked from
    an older commit than the tip, this mode would not find the fork point
    (imagine in the above sample history B0 did not exist, origin/master started
    at B1, moved to B2 and then B, and you forked your topic at origin/master^
    when origin/master was B1; the shape of the history would be the same as
    above, without B0, and the parent of B1 is what <b>git merge-base
    origin/master topic</b> correctly finds, but the <b>--fork-point</b> mode
    will not, because it is not one of the commits that used to be at the tip of
    origin/master).</p>
