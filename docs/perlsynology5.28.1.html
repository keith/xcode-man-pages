perlsynology - Perl 5 on Synology DSM systems

Synology manufactures a vast number of Network Attached Storage (NAS) devices
  that are very popular in large organisations as well as small businesses and
  homes.
<p class="Pp">The NAS systems are equipped with Synology Disk Storage Manager
    (DSM), which is a trimmed-down Linux system enhanced with several tools for
    managing the NAS. There are several flavours of hardware: Marvell Armada
    (ARMv5tel, ARMv7l), Intel Atom (i686, x86_64), Freescale QorIQ (PPC), and
    more. For a full list see the Synology FAQ
    &lt;http://forum.synology.com/wiki/index.php/What_kind_of_CPU_does_my_NAS_have&gt;.</p>
<p class="Pp">Since it is based on Linux, the NAS can run many popular Linux
    software packages, including Perl. In fact, Synology provides a
    ready-to-install package for Perl, depending on the version of DSM the
    installed perl ranges from 5.8.6 on DSM-4.3 to 5.24.0 on DSM-6.1.</p>
<p class="Pp">There is an active user community that provides many software
    packages for the Synology DSM systems; at the time of writing this document
    they provide Perl version 5.24.1.</p>
<p class="Pp">This document describes various features of Synology DSM operating
    system that will affect how Perl 5 (hereafter just Perl) is configured,
    compiled and/or runs. It has been compiled and verified by Johan Vromans for
    the Synology DS413 (QorIQ), with feedback from H.Merijn Brand (DS213,
    ARMv5tel and RS815, Intel Atom x64).</p>

  up the build environment</a></h2>
<i>DSM 5</i>
<p class="Pp">As DSM is a trimmed-down Linux system, it lacks many of the tools
    and libraries commonly found on Linux. The basic tools like sh, cp, rm, etc.
    are implemented using BusyBox
  &lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BusyBox&gt;.</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Using your favourite browser open the DSM management page and start the
      Package Center.</li>
  <li>If you want to smoke test Perl, install
      <span class="Li">&quot;Perl&quot;</span>.</li>
  <li>In Settings, add the following Package Sources:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
  http://www.cphub.net
  http://packages.quadrat4.de
    </pre>
  </li>
  <li>Still in Settings, in Channel Update, select Beta Channel.</li>
  <li>Press Refresh. In the left panel the item &quot;Community&quot; will
      appear. Click it. Select &quot;Bootstrap Installer Beta&quot; and install
      it.</li>
  <li>Likewise, install &quot;iPKGui Beta&quot;.
    <p class="Pp">The application window should now show an icon for iPKGui.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Start iPKGui. Install the packages
      <span class="Li">&quot;make&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;gcc&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;coreutils&quot;</span>.
    <p class="Pp">If you want to smoke test Perl, install
        <span class="Li">&quot;patch&quot;</span>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">The next step is to add some symlinks to system libraries. For
    example, the development software expect a library
    <span class="Li">&quot;libm.so&quot;</span> that normally is a symlink to
    <span class="Li">&quot;libm.so.6&quot;</span>. Synology only provides the
    latter and not the symlink.</p>
<p class="Pp">Here the actual architecture of the Synology system matters. You
    have to find out where the gcc libraries have been installed. Look in /opt
    for a directory similar to arm-none-linux-gnueab or powerpc-linux-gnuspe. In
    the instructions below I'll use powerpc-linux-gnuspe as an example.</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>On the DSM management page start the Control Panel.</li>
  <li>Click Terminal, and enable SSH service.</li>
  <li>Close Terminal and the Control Panel.</li>
  <li>Open a shell on the Synology using ssh and become root.</li>
  <li>Execute the following commands:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
  cd /lib
  ln -s libm.so.6 libm.so
  ln -s libcrypt.so.1 libcrypt.so
  ln -s libdl.so.2 libdl.so
  cd /opt/powerpc-linux-gnuspe/lib  (or
                                    /opt/arm-none-linux-gnueabi/lib)
  ln -s /lib/libdl.so.2 libdl.so
    </pre>
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp"><b>WARNING:</b> When you perform a system software upgrade, these
    links will disappear and need to be re-established.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>DSM 6</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Using iPkg has been deprecated on DSM 6, but an alternative is
    available for DSM 6: entware/opkg. For instructions on how to use that,
    please read Install Entware-ng on Synology NAS
    &lt;https://github.com/Entware-ng/Entware-ng/wiki/Install-on-Synology-NAS&gt;</p>
<p class="Pp">That sadly does not (yet) work on QorIQ. At the moment of writing,
    the supported architectures are armv5, armv7, mipsel, wl500g, x86_32, and
    x86_64. Check here &lt;http://pkg.entware.net/binaries/&gt; for supported
    platforms.</p>
<p class="Pp">Entware-ng comes with a precompiled 5.24.1 (June 2017) that
    allowes building shared XS code. Note that this installation does <b>not</b>
    use a site_perl folder. The available
    <span class="Li">&quot;cpan&quot;</span> works. If all required development
    packages are installed too, also for XS.</p>

When the build environment has been set up, building and testing Perl is
  straightforward. The only thing you need to do is download the sources as
  usual, and add a file Policy.sh as follows:
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  # Administrivia.
  perladmin=&quot;your.email@goes.here&quot;

  # Install Perl in a tree in /opt/perl instead of /opt/bin.
  prefix=/opt/perl

  # Select the compiler. Note that there is no 'cc' alias or link.
  cc=gcc

  # Build flags.
  ccflags=&quot;-DDEBUGGING&quot;

  # Library and include paths.
  libpth=&quot;/lib&quot;
  locincpth=&quot;/opt/include&quot;
  loclibpth=&quot;/lib&quot;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">You may want to create the destination directory and give it the
    right permissions before installing, thus eliminating the need to build Perl
    as a super user.</p>
<p class="Pp">In the directory where you unpacked the sources, issue the
    familiar commands:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  ./Configure -des
  make
  make test
  make install
</pre>

If building completes successfully, you can set up smoke testing as described in
  the Test::Smoke documentation.
<p class="Pp">For smoke testing you need a running Perl. You can either install
    the Synology supplied package for Perl 5.8.6, or build and install your own,
    much more recent version.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that I could not run successful smokes when initiated by the
    Synology Task Scheduler. I resorted to initiating the smokes via a cron job
    run on another system, using ssh:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  ssh nas1 wrk/Test-Smoke/smoke/smokecurrent.sh
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><i>Local patches</i></p>
<p class="Pp">When local patches are applied with smoke testing, the test driver
    will automatically request regeneration of certain tables after the patches
    are applied. The Synology supplied Perl 5.8.6 (at least on the DS413) <b>is
    NOT capable</b> of generating these tables. It will generate opcodes with
    bogus values, causing the build to fail.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can prevent regeneration by adding the setting</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  'flags' =&gt; 0,
</pre>
<p class="Pp">to the smoke config, or by adding another patch that inserts</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  exit 0 if $] == 5.008006;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">in the beginning of the
    <span class="Li">&quot;regen.pl&quot;</span> program.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Adding_libraries"><a class="permalink" href="#Adding_libraries">Adding
  libraries</a></h2>
The above procedure describes a basic environment and hence results in a basic
  Perl. If you want to add additional libraries to Perl, you may need some extra
  settings.
<p class="Pp">For example, the basic Perl does not have any of the DB libraries
    (db, dbm, ndbm, gdsm). You can add these using iPKGui, however, you need to
    set environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the appropriate value:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/lib:/opt/lib
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This setting needs to be in effect while Perl is built, but also
    when the programs are run.</p>
