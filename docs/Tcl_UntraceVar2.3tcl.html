   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

<b>Tcl_TraceVar</b> allows a C procedure to monitor and control access to a Tcl
  variable, so that the C procedure is invoked whenever the variable is read or
  written or unset. If the trace is created successfully then
  <b>Tcl_TraceVar</b> returns <b>TCL_OK</b>. If an error occurred (e.g.
  <i>varName</i> specifies an element of an array, but the actual variable is
  not an array) then <b>TCL_ERROR</b> is returned and an error message is left
  in the interpreter's result.
<p class="Pp">The <i>flags</i> argument to <b>Tcl_TraceVar</b> indicates when
    the trace procedure is to be invoked and provides information for setting up
    the trace. It consists of an OR-ed combination of any of the following
    values:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>TCL_GLOBAL_ONLY</b></dt>
  <dd>Normally, the variable will be looked up at the current level of procedure
      call; if this bit is set then the variable will be looked up at global
      level, ignoring any active procedures.</dd>
  <dt><b>TCL_NAMESPACE_ONLY</b></dt>
  <dd>Normally, the variable will be looked up at the current level of procedure
      call; if this bit is set then the variable will be looked up in the
      current namespace, ignoring any active procedures.</dd>
  <dt><b>TCL_TRACE_READS</b></dt>
  <dd>Invoke <i>proc</i> whenever an attempt is made to read the variable.</dd>
  <dt><b>TCL_TRACE_WRITES</b></dt>
  <dd>Invoke <i>proc</i> whenever an attempt is made to modify the
    variable.</dd>
  <dt><b>TCL_TRACE_UNSETS</b></dt>
  <dd>Invoke <i>proc</i> whenever the variable is unset. A variable may be unset
      either explicitly by an <b>unset</b> command, or implicitly when a
      procedure returns (its local variables are automatically unset) or when
      the interpreter is deleted (all variables are automatically unset).</dd>
  <dt><b>TCL_TRACE_ARRAY</b></dt>
  <dd>Invoke <i>proc</i> whenever the array command is invoked. This gives the
      trace procedure a chance to update the array before array names or array
      get is called. Note that this is called before an array set, but that will
      trigger write traces.</dd>
  <dt><b>TCL_TRACE_RESULT_DYNAMIC</b></dt>
  <dd>The result of invoking the <i>proc</i> is a dynamically allocated string
      that will be released by the Tcl library via a call to <b>ckfree</b>. Must
      not be specified at the same time as <b>TCL_TRACE_RESULT_OBJECT</b>.</dd>
  <dt><b>TCL_TRACE_RESULT_OBJECT</b></dt>
  <dd>The result of invoking the <i>proc</i> is a Tcl_Obj* (cast to a char*)
      with a reference count of at least one. The ownership of that reference
      will be transferred to the Tcl core for release (when the core has
      finished with it) via a call to <b>Tcl_DecrRefCount</b>. Must not be
      specified at the same time as <b>TCL_TRACE_RESULT_DYNAMIC</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Whenever one of the specified operations occurs on the variable,
    <i>proc</i> will be invoked. It should have arguments and result that match
    the type <b>Tcl_VarTraceProc</b>:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
typedef char *Tcl_VarTraceProc(
        ClientData <i>clientData</i>,
        Tcl_Interp *<i>interp</i>,
        char *<i>name1</i>,
        char *<i>name2</i>,
        int <i>flags</i>);
</pre>
</div>
The <i>clientData</i> and <i>interp</i> parameters will have the same values as
  those passed to <b>Tcl_TraceVar</b> when the trace was created.
  <i>ClientData</i> typically points to an application-specific data structure
  that describes what to do when <i>proc</i> is invoked. <i>Name1</i> and
  <i>name2</i> give the name of the traced variable in the normal two-part form
  (see the description of <b>Tcl_TraceVar2</b> below for details). <i>Flags</i>
  is an OR-ed combination of bits providing several pieces of information. One
  of the bits <b>TCL_TRACE_READS</b>, <b>TCL_TRACE_WRITES</b>,
  <b>TCL_TRACE_ARRAY</b>, or <b>TCL_TRACE_UNSETS</b> will be set in <i>flags</i>
  to indicate which operation is being performed on the variable. The bit
  <b>TCL_GLOBAL_ONLY</b> will be set whenever the variable being accessed is a
  global one not accessible from the current level of procedure call: the trace
  procedure will need to pass this flag back to variable-related procedures like
  <b>Tcl_GetVar</b> if it attempts to access the variable. The bit
  <b>TCL_NAMESPACE_ONLY</b> will be set whenever the variable being accessed is
  a namespace one not accessible from the current level of procedure call: the
  trace procedure will need to pass this flag back to variable-related
  procedures like <b>Tcl_GetVar</b> if it attempts to access the variable. The
  bit <b>TCL_TRACE_DESTROYED</b> will be set in <i>flags</i> if the trace is
  about to be destroyed; this information may be useful to <i>proc</i> so that
  it can clean up its own internal data structures (see the section
  <b>TCL_TRACE_DESTROYED</b> below for more details). Lastly, the bit
  <b>TCL_INTERP_DESTROYED</b> will be set if the entire interpreter is being
  destroyed. When this bit is set, <i>proc</i> must be especially careful in the
  things it does (see the section <b>TCL_INTERP_DESTROYED</b> below). The trace
  procedure's return value should normally be NULL; see <b>ERROR RETURNS</b>
  below for information on other possibilities.
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_UntraceVar</b> may be used to remove a trace. If the
    variable specified by <i>interp</i>, <i>varName</i>, and <i>flags</i> has a
    trace set with <i>flags</i>, <i>proc</i>, and <i>clientData</i>, then the
    corresponding trace is removed. If no such trace exists, then the call to
    <b>Tcl_UntraceVar</b> has no effect. The same bits are valid for
    <i>flags</i> as for calls to <b>Tcl_TraceVar</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_VarTraceInfo</b> may be used to retrieve information about
    traces set on a given variable. The return value from
    <b>Tcl_VarTraceInfo</b> is the <i>clientData</i> associated with a
    particular trace. The trace must be on the variable specified by the
    <i>interp</i>, <i>varName</i>, and <i>flags</i> arguments (only the
    <b>TCL_GLOBAL_ONLY</b> and <b>TCL_NAMESPACE_ONLY</b> bits from <i>flags</i>
    is used; other bits are ignored) and its trace procedure must the same as
    the <i>proc</i> argument. If the <i>prevClientData</i> argument is NULL then
    the return value corresponds to the first (most recently created) matching
    trace, or NULL if there are no matching traces. If the <i>prevClientData</i>
    argument is not NULL, then it should be the return value from a previous
    call to <b>Tcl_VarTraceInfo</b>. In this case, the new return value will
    correspond to the next matching trace after the one whose <i>clientData</i>
    matches <i>prevClientData</i>, or NULL if no trace matches
    <i>prevClientData</i> or if there are no more matching traces after it. This
    mechanism makes it possible to step through all of the traces for a given
    variable that have the same <i>proc</i>.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="TWO-PART_NAMES"><a class="permalink" href="#TWO-PART_NAMES">TWO-PART
  NAMES</a></h1>
The procedures <b>Tcl_TraceVar2</b>, <b>Tcl_UntraceVar2</b>, and
  <b>Tcl_VarTraceInfo2</b> are identical to <b>Tcl_TraceVar</b>,
  <b>Tcl_UntraceVar</b>, and <b>Tcl_VarTraceInfo</b>, respectively, except that
  the name of the variable consists of two parts. <i>Name1</i> gives the name of
  a scalar variable or array, and <i>name2</i> gives the name of an element
  within an array. When <i>name2</i> is NULL, <i>name1</i> may contain both an
  array and an element name: if the name contains an open parenthesis and ends
  with a close parenthesis, then the value between the parentheses is treated as
  an element name (which can have any string value) and the characters before
  the first open parenthesis are treated as the name of an array variable. If
  <i>name2</i> is NULL and <i>name1</i> does not refer to an array element it
  means that either the variable is a scalar or the trace is to be set on the
  entire array rather than an individual element (see WHOLE-ARRAY TRACES below
  for more information).

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="ACCESSING_VARIABLES_DURING_TRACES"><a class="permalink" href="#ACCESSING_VARIABLES_DURING_TRACES">ACCESSING
  VARIABLES DURING TRACES</a></h1>
During read, write, and array traces, the trace procedure can read, write, or
  unset the traced variable using <b>Tcl_GetVar2</b>, <b>Tcl_SetVar2</b>, and
  other procedures. While <i>proc</i> is executing, traces are temporarily
  disabled for the variable, so that calls to <b>Tcl_GetVar2</b> and
  <b>Tcl_SetVar2</b> will not cause <i>proc</i> or other trace procedures to be
  invoked again. Disabling only occurs for the variable whose trace procedure is
  active; accesses to other variables will still be traced. However, if a
  variable is unset during a read or write trace then unset traces will be
  invoked.
<p class="Pp">During unset traces the variable has already been completely
    expunged. It is possible for the trace procedure to read or write the
    variable, but this will be a new version of the variable. Traces are not
    disabled during unset traces as they are for read and write traces, but
    existing traces have been removed from the variable before any trace
    procedures are invoked. If new traces are set by unset trace procedures,
    these traces will be invoked on accesses to the variable by the trace
    procedures.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="CALLBACK_TIMING"><a class="permalink" href="#CALLBACK_TIMING">CALLBACK
  TIMING</a></h1>
When read tracing has been specified for a variable, the trace procedure will be
  invoked whenever the variable's value is read. This includes <b>set</b> Tcl
  commands, <b>$</b>-notation in Tcl commands, and invocations of the
  <b>Tcl_GetVar</b> and <b>Tcl_GetVar2</b> procedures. <i>Proc</i> is invoked
  just before the variable's value is returned. It may modify the value of the
  variable to affect what is returned by the traced access. If it unsets the
  variable then the access will return an error just as if the variable never
  existed.
<p class="Pp">When write tracing has been specified for a variable, the trace
    procedure will be invoked whenever the variable's value is modified. This
    includes <b>set</b> commands, commands that modify variables as side effects
    (such as <b>catch</b> and <b>scan</b>), and calls to the <b>Tcl_SetVar</b>
    and <b>Tcl_SetVar2</b> procedures). <i>Proc</i> will be invoked after the
    variable's value has been modified, but before the new value of the variable
    has been returned. It may modify the value of the variable to override the
    change and to determine the value actually returned by the traced access. If
    it deletes the variable then the traced access will return an empty
  string.</p>
<p class="Pp">When array tracing has been specified, the trace procedure will be
    invoked at the beginning of the array command implementation, before any of
    the operations like get, set, or names have been invoked. The trace
    procedure can modify the array elements with <b>Tcl_SetVar</b> and
    <b>Tcl_SetVar2</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">When unset tracing has been specified, the trace procedure will be
    invoked whenever the variable is destroyed. The traces will be called after
    the variable has been completely unset.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="WHOLE-ARRAY_TRACES"><a class="permalink" href="#WHOLE-ARRAY_TRACES">WHOLE-ARRAY
  TRACES</a></h1>
If a call to <b>Tcl_TraceVar</b> or <b>Tcl_TraceVar2</b> specifies the name of
  an array variable without an index into the array, then the trace will be set
  on the array as a whole. This means that <i>proc</i> will be invoked whenever
  any element of the array is accessed in the ways specified by <i>flags</i>.
  When an array is unset, a whole-array trace will be invoked just once, with
  <i>name1</i> equal to the name of the array and <i>name2</i> NULL; it will not
  be invoked once for each element.
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="MULTIPLE_TRACES"><a class="permalink" href="#MULTIPLE_TRACES">MULTIPLE
  TRACES</a></h1>
It is possible for multiple traces to exist on the same variable. When this
  happens, all of the trace procedures will be invoked on each access, in order
  from most-recently-created to least-recently-created. When there exist
  whole-array traces for an array as well as traces on individual elements, the
  whole-array traces are invoked before the individual-element traces. If a read
  or write trace unsets the variable then all of the unset traces will be
  invoked but the remainder of the read and write traces will be skipped.
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="ERROR_RETURNS"><a class="permalink" href="#ERROR_RETURNS">ERROR
  RETURNS</a></h1>
Under normal conditions trace procedures should return NULL, indicating
  successful completion. If <i>proc</i> returns a non-NULL value it signifies
  that an error occurred. The return value must be a pointer to a static
  character string containing an error message, unless (<i>exactly</i> one of)
  the <b>TCL_TRACE_RESULT_DYNAMIC</b> and <b>TCL_TRACE_RESULT_OBJECT</b> flags
  is set, which specify that the result is either a dynamic string (to be
  released with <b>ckfree</b>) or a Tcl_Obj* (cast to char* and to be released
  with <b>Tcl_DecrRefCount</b>) containing the error message. If a trace
  procedure returns an error, no further traces are invoked for the access and
  the traced access aborts with the given message. Trace procedures can use this
  facility to make variables read-only, for example (but note that the value of
  the variable will already have been modified before the trace procedure is
  called, so the trace procedure will have to restore the correct value).
<p class="Pp">The return value from <i>proc</i> is only used during read and
    write tracing. During unset traces, the return value is ignored and all
    relevant trace procedures will always be invoked.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="RESTRICTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#RESTRICTIONS">RESTRICTIONS</a></h1>
A trace procedure can be called at any time, even when there is a partially
  formed result in the interpreter's result area. If the trace procedure does
  anything that could damage this result (such as calling <b>Tcl_Eval</b>) then
  it must save the original values of the interpreter's <b>result</b> and
  <b>freeProc</b> fields and restore them before it returns.
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="UNDEFINED_VARIABLES"><a class="permalink" href="#UNDEFINED_VARIABLES">UNDEFINED
  VARIABLES</a></h1>
It is legal to set a trace on an undefined variable. The variable will still
  appear to be undefined until the first time its value is set. If an undefined
  variable is traced and then unset, the unset will fail with an error
  (&#x201C;no such variable&#x201D;), but the trace procedure will still be
  invoked.
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="TCL_TRACE_DESTROYED_FLAG"><a class="permalink" href="#TCL_TRACE_DESTROYED_FLAG">TCL_TRACE_DESTROYED
  FLAG</a></h1>
In an unset callback to <i>proc</i>, the <b>TCL_TRACE_DESTROYED</b> bit is set
  in <i>flags</i> if the trace is being removed as part of the deletion. Traces
  on a variable are always removed whenever the variable is deleted; the only
  time <b>TCL_TRACE_DESTROYED</b> is not set is for a whole-array trace invoked
  when only a single element of an array is unset.
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="TCL_INTERP_DESTROYED"><a class="permalink" href="#TCL_INTERP_DESTROYED">TCL_INTERP_DESTROYED</a></h1>
When an interpreter is destroyed, unset traces are called for all of its
  variables. The <b>TCL_INTERP_DESTROYED</b> bit will be set in the <i>flags</i>
  argument passed to the trace procedures. Trace procedures must be extremely
  careful in what they do if the <b>TCL_INTERP_DESTROYED</b> bit is set. It is
  not safe for the procedures to invoke any Tcl procedures on the interpreter,
  since its state is partially deleted. All that trace procedures should do
  under these circumstances is to clean up and free their own internal data
  structures.
