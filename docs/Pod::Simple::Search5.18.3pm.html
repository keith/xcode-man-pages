<p class="Pp"><b>Pod::Simple::Search</b> is a class that you use for running
    searches for Pod files. An object of this class has several attributes
    (mostly options for controlling search options), and some methods for
    searching based on those attributes.</p>
<p class="Pp">The way to use this class is to make a new object of this class,
    set any options, and then call one of the search options (probably
    <span class="Li">&quot;survey&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;find&quot;</span>). The sections below discuss the
    syntaxes for doing all that.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="CONSTRUCTOR"><a class="permalink" href="#CONSTRUCTOR">CONSTRUCTOR</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">This class provides the one constructor, called
    <span class="Li">&quot;new&quot;</span>. It takes no parameters:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  use Pod::Simple::Search;
  my $search = Pod::Simple::Search-&gt;new;
</pre>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="ACCESSORS"><a class="permalink" href="#ACCESSORS">ACCESSORS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">This class defines several methods for setting (and, occasionally,
    reading) the contents of an object. With two exceptions (discussed at the
    end of this section), these attributes are just for controlling the way
    searches are carried out.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that each of these return <span class="Li">$self</span> when
    you call them as
    <span class="Li">&quot;$self-&gt;</span><span class="Li"><i>whatever(value)</i></span><span class="Li">&quot;</span>.
    That's so that you can chain together set-attribute calls like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  my $name2path =
    Pod::Simple::Search-&gt;new
    -&gt; inc(0) -&gt; verbose(1) -&gt; callback(\&amp;blab)
    -&gt;survey(@there);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">...which works exactly as if you'd done this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  my $search = Pod::Simple::Search-&gt;new;
  $search-&gt;inc(0);
  $search-&gt;verbose(1);
  $search-&gt;callback(\&amp;blab);
  my $name2path = $search-&gt;survey(@there);
</pre>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>$search-&gt;inc( <i>true-or-false</i> );</dt>
  <dd>This attribute, if set to a true value, means that searches should
      implicitly add perl's <i></i><span class="Li"><i>@INC</i></span><i></i>
      paths. This automatically considers paths specified in the
      <span class="Li">&quot;PERL5LIB&quot;</span> environment as this is
      prepended to <i></i><span class="Li"><i>@INC</i></span><i></i> by the Perl
      interpreter itself. This attribute's default value is <b>TRUE</b>. If you
      want to search only specific directories, set
      <span class="Li">$self</span>-&gt;<i>inc</i>(0) before calling
      <span class="Li">$inc</span>-&gt;survey or
      <span class="Li">$inc</span>-&gt;find.</dd>
  <dt>$search-&gt;verbose( <i>nonnegative-number</i> );</dt>
  <dd>This attribute, if set to a nonzero positive value, will make searches
      output (via <span class="Li">&quot;warn&quot;</span>) notes about what
      they're doing as they do it. This option may be useful for debugging a
      pod-related module. This attribute's default value is zero, meaning that
      no <span class="Li">&quot;warn&quot;</span> messages are produced.
      (Setting verbose to 1 turns on some messages, and setting it to 2 turns on
      even more messages, i.e., makes the following search(es) even more verbose
      than 1 would make them.)</dd>
  <dt>$search-&gt;limit_glob( <i>some-glob-string</i> );</dt>
  <dd>This option means that you want to limit the results just to items whose
      podnames match the given glob/wildcard expression. For example, you might
      limit your search to just &quot;LWP::*&quot;, to search only for modules
      starting with &quot;LWP::*&quot; (but not including the module
      &quot;LWP&quot; itself); or you might limit your search to &quot;LW*&quot;
      to see only modules whose (full) names begin with &quot;LW&quot;; or you
      might search for &quot;*Find*&quot; to search for all modules with
      &quot;Find&quot; somewhere in their full name. (You can also use
      &quot;?&quot; in a glob expression; so &quot;DB?&quot; will match
      &quot;DBI&quot; and &quot;DBD&quot;.)</dd>
  <dt>$search-&gt;callback( <i>\&amp;some_routine</i> );</dt>
  <dd>This attribute means that every time this search sees a matching Pod file,
      it should call this callback routine. The routine is called with two
      parameters: the current file's filespec, and its pod name. (For example:
      <span class="Li">&quot;(&quot;/etc/perljunk/File/Crunk.pm&quot;,
      &quot;File::Crunk&quot;)&quot;</span> would be in
      <span class="Li">@_</span>.)
    <p class="Pp">The callback routine's return value is not used for
      anything.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This attribute's default value is false, meaning that no
        callback is called.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>$search-&gt;laborious( <i>true-or-false</i> );</dt>
  <dd>Unless you set this attribute to a true value, Pod::Search will apply
      Perl-specific heuristics to find the correct module PODs quickly. This
      attribute's default value is false. You won't normally need to set this to
      true.
    <p class="Pp">Specifically: Turning on this option will disable the
        heuristics for seeing only files with Perl-like extensions, omitting
        subdirectories that are numeric but do <i>not</i> match the current Perl
        interpreter's version ID, suppressing <i>site_perl</i> as a module
        hierarchy name, etc.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>$search-&gt;shadows( <i>true-or-false</i> );</dt>
  <dd>Unless you set this attribute to a true value, Pod::Simple::Search will
      consider only the first file of a given modulename as it looks thru the
      specified directories; that is, with this option off, if
      Pod::Simple::Search has seen a
      <span class="Li">&quot;somepathdir/Foo/Bar.pm&quot;</span> already in this
      search, then it won't bother looking at a
      <span class="Li">&quot;somelaterpathdir/Foo/Bar.pm&quot;</span> later on
      in that search, because that file is merely a &quot;shadow&quot;. But if
      you turn on <span class="Li">&quot;$self-&gt;shadows(1)&quot;</span>, then
      these &quot;shadow&quot; files are inspected too, and are noted in the
      pathname2podname return hash.
    <p class="Pp">This attribute's default value is false; and normally you
        won't need to turn it on.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>$search-&gt;limit_re( <i>some-regxp</i> );</dt>
  <dd>Setting this attribute (to a value that's a regexp) means that you want to
      limit the results just to items whose podnames match the given regexp.
      Normally this option is not needed, and the more efficient
      <span class="Li">&quot;limit_glob&quot;</span> attribute is used
    instead.</dd>
  <dt>$search-&gt;dir_prefix( <i>some-string-value</i> );</dt>
  <dd>Setting this attribute to a string value means that the searches should
      begin in the specified subdirectory name (like &quot;Pod&quot; or
      &quot;File::Find&quot;, also expressable as &quot;File/Find&quot;). For
      example, the search option
      <span class="Li">&quot;$search-&gt;limit_glob(&quot;File::Find::R*&quot;)&quot;</span>
      is the same as the combination of the search options
      <span class="Li">&quot;$search-&gt;limit_re(&quot;^File::Find::R&quot;)
      -&gt; dir_prefix(&quot;File::Find&quot;)&quot;</span>.
    <p class="Pp">Normally you don't need to know about the
        <span class="Li">&quot;dir_prefix&quot;</span> option, but I include it
        in case it might prove useful for someone somewhere.</p>
    <p class="Pp">(Implementationally, searching with limit_glob ends up setting
        limit_re and usually dir_prefix.)</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>$search-&gt;progress( <i>some-progress-object</i> );</dt>
  <dd>If you set a value for this attribute, the value is expected to be an
      object (probably of a class that you define) that has a
      <span class="Li">&quot;reach&quot;</span> method and a
      <span class="Li">&quot;done&quot;</span> method. This is meant for
      reporting progress during the search, if you don't want to use a simple
      callback.
    <p class="Pp">Normally you don't need to know about the
        <span class="Li">&quot;progress&quot;</span> option, but I include it in
        case it might prove useful for someone somewhere.</p>
    <p class="Pp">While a search is in progress, the progress object's
        <span class="Li">&quot;reach&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;done&quot;</span> methods are called like
      this:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>  # Every time a file is being scanned for pod:
  $progress-&gt;reach($count, &quot;Scanning $file&quot;);   ++$count;
  # And then at the end of the search:
  $progress-&gt;done(&quot;Noted $count Pod files total&quot;);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Internally, we often set this to an object of class
        Pod::Simple::Progress. That class is probably undocumented, but you may
        wish to look at its source.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>$name2path = $self-&gt;name2path;</dt>
  <dd>This attribute is not a search parameter, but is used to report the result
      of <span class="Li">&quot;survey&quot;</span> method, as discussed in the
      next section.</dd>
  <dt>$path2name = $self-&gt;path2name;</dt>
  <dd>This attribute is not a search parameter, but is used to report the result
      of <span class="Li">&quot;survey&quot;</span> method, as discussed in the
      next section.</dd>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="MAIN_SEARCH_METHODS"><a class="permalink" href="#MAIN_SEARCH_METHODS">MAIN
  SEARCH METHODS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Once you've actually set any options you want (if any), you can go
    ahead and use the following methods to search for Pod files in particular
    ways.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">&quot;$search-&gt;survey( @directories )&quot;</h2>
<p class="Pp">The method <span class="Li">&quot;survey&quot;</span> searches for
    POD documents in a given set of files and/or directories. This runs the
    search according to the various options set by the accessors above. (For
    example, if the <span class="Li">&quot;inc&quot;</span> attribute is on, as
    it is by default, then the perl <span class="Li">@INC</span> directories are
    implicitly added to the list of directories (if any) that you specify.)</p>
<p class="Pp">The return value of <span class="Li">&quot;survey&quot;</span> is
    two hashes:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>&quot;name2path&quot;</dt>
  <dd>A hash that maps from each pod-name to the filespec (like
      &quot;Stuff::Thing&quot; =&gt;
    &quot;/whatever/plib/Stuff/Thing.pm&quot;)</dd>
  <dt>&quot;path2name&quot;</dt>
  <dd>A hash that maps from each Pod filespec to its pod-name (like
      &quot;/whatever/plib/Stuff/Thing.pm&quot; =&gt;
    &quot;Stuff::Thing&quot;)</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Besides saving these hashes as the hashref attributes
    <span class="Li">&quot;name2path&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;path2name&quot;</span>, calling this function also
    returns these hashrefs. In list context, the return value of
    <span class="Li">&quot;$search-&gt;survey&quot;</span> is the list
    <span class="Li">&quot;(\%name2path, \%path2name)&quot;</span>. In scalar
    context, the return value is
    <span class="Li">&quot;\%name2path&quot;</span>. Or you can just call this
    in void context.</p>
<p class="Pp">Regardless of calling context, calling
    <span class="Li">&quot;survey&quot;</span> saves its results in its
    <span class="Li">&quot;name2path&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;path2name&quot;</span> attributes.</p>
<p class="Pp">E.g., when searching in
    <i></i><span class="Li"><i>$HOME</i></span><i>/perl5lib</i>, the file
    <i></i><span class="Li"><i>$HOME</i></span><i>/perl5lib/MyModule.pm</i>
    would get the POD name <i>MyModule</i>, whereas
    <i></i><span class="Li"><i>$HOME</i></span><i>/perl5lib/Myclass/Subclass.pm</i>
    would be <i>Myclass::Subclass</i>. The name information can be used for POD
    translators.</p>
<p class="Pp">Only text files containing at least one valid POD command are
    found.</p>
<p class="Pp">In verbose mode, a warning is printed if shadows are found (i.e.,
    more than one POD file with the same POD name is found, e.g. <i>CPAN.pm</i>
    in different directories). This usually indicates duplicate occurrences of
    modules in the <i></i><span class="Li"><i>@INC</i></span><i></i> search
    path, which is occasionally inadvertent (but is often simply a case of a
    user's path dir having a more recent version than the system's general path
    dirs in general.)</p>
<p class="Pp">The options to this argument is a list of either directories that
    are searched recursively, or files. (Usually you wouldn't specify files, but
    just dirs.) Or you can just specify an empty-list, as in
    <span class="Li">$name2path</span>; with the
    <span class="Li">&quot;inc&quot;</span> option on, as it is by default,
  teh</p>
<p class="Pp">The POD names of files are the plain basenames with any Perl-like
    extension (.pm, .pl, .pod) stripped, and path separators replaced by
    <span class="Li">&quot;::&quot;</span>'s.</p>
<p class="Pp">Calling Pod::Simple::Search-&gt;search(...) is short for
    Pod::Simple::Search-&gt;new-&gt;search(...). That is, a throwaway object
    with default attribute values is used.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">&quot;$search-&gt;simplify_name( $str )&quot;</h2>
<p class="Pp">The method <b>simplify_name</b> is equivalent to <b>basename</b>,
    but also strips Perl-like extensions (.pm, .pl, .pod) and extensions like
    <i>.bat</i>, <i>.cmd</i> on Win32 and OS/2, or <i>.com</i> on VMS,
    respectively.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">&quot;$search-&gt;find( $pod )&quot;</h2>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">&quot;$search-&gt;find( $pod, @search_dirs )&quot;</h2>
<p class="Pp">Returns the location of a Pod file, given a Pod/module/script name
    (like &quot;Foo::Bar&quot; or &quot;perlvar&quot; or &quot;perldoc&quot;),
    and an idea of what files/directories to look in. It searches according to
    the various options set by the accessors above. (For example, if the
    <span class="Li">&quot;inc&quot;</span> attribute is on, as it is by
    default, then the perl <span class="Li">@INC</span> directories are
    implicitly added to the list of directories (if any) that you specify.)</p>
<p class="Pp">This returns the full path of the first occurrence to the file.
    Package names (eg 'A::B') are automatically converted to directory names in
    the selected directory. Additionally, '.pm', '.pl' and '.pod' are
    automatically appended to the search as required. (So, for example, under
    Unix, &quot;A::B&quot; is converted to &quot;somedir/A/B.pm&quot;,
    &quot;somedir/A/B.pod&quot;, or &quot;somedir/A/B.pl&quot;, as
  appropriate.)</p>
<p class="Pp">If no such Pod file is found, this method returns undef.</p>
<p class="Pp">If any of the given search directories contains a <i>pod/</i>
    subdirectory, then it is searched. (That's how we manage to find
    <i>perlfunc</i>, for example, which is usually in <i>pod/perlfunc</i> in
    most Perl dists.)</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;verbose&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;inc&quot;</span> attributes influence the behavior of
    this search; notably, <span class="Li">&quot;inc&quot;</span>, if true, adds
    <span class="Li">@INC</span> <i>and also</i>
    <i></i><span class="Li"><i>$Config::Config</i></span><i>{'scriptdir'}</i> to
    the list of directories to search.</p>
<p class="Pp">It is common to simply say <span class="Li">&quot;$filename =
    Pod::Simple::Search-&gt; new</span>
    <span class="Li">-&gt;find(&quot;perlvar&quot;)&quot;</span> so that just
    the <span class="Li">@INC</span> (well, and scriptdir) directories are
    searched. (This happens because the <span class="Li">&quot;inc&quot;</span>
    attribute is true by default.)</p>
<p class="Pp">Calling Pod::Simple::Search-&gt;find(...) is short for
    Pod::Simple::Search-&gt;new-&gt;find(...). That is, a throwaway object with
    default attribute values is used.</p>
