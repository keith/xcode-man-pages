This module tells its users that functions in the FOOBAR package are to be
  autoloaded from after the <span class="Li">&quot;__DATA__&quot;</span> token.
  See also &quot;Autoloading&quot; in perlsub.
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="The_____DATA_____token"><a class="permalink" href="#The_____DATA_____token">The
  __DATA__ token</a></h2>
The <span class="Li">&quot;__DATA__&quot;</span> token tells the perl compiler
  that the perl code for compilation is finished. Everything after the
  <span class="Li">&quot;__DATA__&quot;</span> token is available for reading
  via the filehandle FOOBAR::DATA, where FOOBAR is the name of the current
  package when the <span class="Li">&quot;__DATA__&quot;</span> token is
  reached. This works just the same as
  <span class="Li">&quot;__END__&quot;</span> does in package 'main', but for
  other modules data after <span class="Li">&quot;__END__&quot;</span> is not
  automatically retrievable, whereas data after
  <span class="Li">&quot;__DATA__&quot;</span> is. The
  <span class="Li">&quot;__DATA__&quot;</span> token is not recognized in
  versions of perl prior to 5.001m.
<p class="Pp">Note that it is possible to have
    <span class="Li">&quot;__DATA__&quot;</span> tokens in the same package in
    multiple files, and that the last
    <span class="Li">&quot;__DATA__&quot;</span> token in a given package that
    is encountered by the compiler is the one accessible by the filehandle. This
    also applies to <span class="Li">&quot;__END__&quot;</span> and main, i.e.
    if the 'main' program has an <span class="Li">&quot;__END__&quot;</span>,
    but a module 'require'd (_not_ 'use'd) by that program has a 'package main;'
    declaration followed by an '<span class="Li">&quot;__DATA__&quot;</span>',
    then the <span class="Li">&quot;DATA&quot;</span> filehandle is set to
    access the data after the <span class="Li">&quot;__DATA__&quot;</span> in
    the module, _not_ the data after the
    <span class="Li">&quot;__END__&quot;</span> token in the 'main' program,
    since the compiler encounters the 'require'd file later.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="SelfLoader_autoloading"><a class="permalink" href="#SelfLoader_autoloading">SelfLoader
  autoloading</a></h2>
The <b>SelfLoader</b> works by the user placing the
  <span class="Li">&quot;__DATA__&quot;</span> token <i>after</i> perl code
  which needs to be compiled and run at 'require' time, but <i>before</i>
  subroutine declarations that can be loaded in later - usually because they may
  never be called.
<p class="Pp">The <b>SelfLoader</b> will read from the FOOBAR::DATA filehandle
    to load in the data after <span class="Li">&quot;__DATA__&quot;</span>, and
    load in any subroutine when it is called. The costs are the one-time parsing
    of the data after <span class="Li">&quot;__DATA__&quot;</span>, and a load
    delay for the _first_ call of any autoloaded function. The benefits
    (hopefully) are a speeded up compilation phase, with no need to load
    functions which are never used.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>SelfLoader</b> will stop reading from
    <span class="Li">&quot;__DATA__&quot;</span> if it encounters the
    <span class="Li">&quot;__END__&quot;</span> token - just as you would
    expect. If the <span class="Li">&quot;__END__&quot;</span> token is present,
    and is followed by the token DATA, then the <b>SelfLoader</b> leaves the
    FOOBAR::DATA filehandle open on the line after that token.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>SelfLoader</b> exports the
    <span class="Li">&quot;AUTOLOAD&quot;</span> subroutine to the package using
    the <b>SelfLoader</b>, and this loads the called subroutine when it is first
    called.</p>
<p class="Pp">There is no advantage to putting subroutines which will _always_
    be called after the <span class="Li">&quot;__DATA__&quot;</span> token.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Autoloading_and_package_lexicals"><a class="permalink" href="#Autoloading_and_package_lexicals">Autoloading
  and package lexicals</a></h2>
A 'my <span class="Li">$pack_lexical</span>' statement makes the variable
  <span class="Li">$pack_lexical</span> local _only_ to the file up to the
  <span class="Li">&quot;__DATA__&quot;</span> token. Subroutines declared
  elsewhere _cannot_ see these types of variables, just as if you declared
  subroutines in the package but in another file, they cannot see these
  variables.
<p class="Pp">So specifically, autoloaded functions cannot see package lexicals
    (this applies to both the <b>SelfLoader</b> and the Autoloader). The
    <span class="Li">&quot;vars&quot;</span> pragma provides an alternative to
    defining package-level globals that will be visible to autoloaded routines.
    See the documentation on <b>vars</b> in the pragma section of perlmod.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="SelfLoader_and_AutoLoader"><a class="permalink" href="#SelfLoader_and_AutoLoader">SelfLoader
  and AutoLoader</a></h2>
The <b>SelfLoader</b> can replace the AutoLoader - just change 'use AutoLoader'
  to 'use SelfLoader' (though note that the <b>SelfLoader</b> exports the
  AUTOLOAD function - but if you have your own AUTOLOAD and are using the
  AutoLoader too, you probably know what you're doing), and the
  <span class="Li">&quot;__END__&quot;</span> token to
  <span class="Li">&quot;__DATA__&quot;</span>. You will need perl version
  5.001m or later to use this (version 5.001 with all patches up to patch m).
<p class="Pp">There is no need to inherit from the <b>SelfLoader</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>SelfLoader</b> works similarly to the AutoLoader, but picks
    up the subs from after the <span class="Li">&quot;__DATA__&quot;</span>
    instead of in the 'lib/auto' directory. There is a maintenance gain in not
    needing to run AutoSplit on the module at installation, and a runtime gain
    in not needing to keep opening and closing files to load subs. There is a
    runtime loss in needing to parse the code after the
    <span class="Li">&quot;__DATA__&quot;</span>. Details of the
    <b>AutoLoader</b> and another view of these distinctions can be found in
    that module's documentation.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="____DATA____,_____END____,_and_the__s-1FOOBAR::DATA_s0_filehandle."><a class="permalink" href="#____DATA____,_____END____,_and_the__s-1FOOBAR::DATA_s0_filehandle.">__DATA__,
  __END__, and the FOOBAR::DATA filehandle.</a></h2>
This section is only relevant if you want to use the
  <span class="Li">&quot;FOOBAR::DATA&quot;</span> together with the
  <b>SelfLoader</b>.
<p class="Pp">Data after the <span class="Li">&quot;__DATA__&quot;</span> token
    in a module is read using the FOOBAR::DATA filehandle.
    <span class="Li">&quot;__END__&quot;</span> can still be used to denote the
    end of the <span class="Li">&quot;__DATA__&quot;</span> section if followed
    by the token DATA - this is supported by the <b>SelfLoader</b>. The
    <span class="Li">&quot;FOOBAR::DATA&quot;</span> filehandle is left open if
    an <span class="Li">&quot;__END__&quot;</span> followed by a DATA is found,
    with the filehandle positioned at the start of the line after the
    <span class="Li">&quot;__END__&quot;</span> token. If no
    <span class="Li">&quot;__END__&quot;</span> token is present, or an
    <span class="Li">&quot;__END__&quot;</span> token with no DATA token on the
    same line, then the filehandle is closed.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>SelfLoader</b> reads from wherever the current position of
    the <span class="Li">&quot;FOOBAR::DATA&quot;</span> filehandle is, until
    the EOF or <span class="Li">&quot;__END__&quot;</span>. This means that if
    you want to use that filehandle (and ONLY if you want to), you should
  either</p>
<p class="Pp">1. Put all your subroutine declarations immediately after the
    <span class="Li">&quot;__DATA__&quot;</span> token and put your own data
    after those declarations, using the
    <span class="Li">&quot;__END__&quot;</span> token to mark the end of
    subroutine declarations. You must also ensure that the <b>SelfLoader</b>
    reads first by calling 'SelfLoader-&gt;<b>load_stubs()</b>;', or by using a
    function which is selfloaded;</p>
<p class="Pp">or</p>
<p class="Pp">2. You should read the
    <span class="Li">&quot;FOOBAR::DATA&quot;</span> filehandle first, leaving
    the handle open and positioned at the first line of subroutine
  declarations.</p>
<p class="Pp">You could conceivably do both.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Classes_and_inherited_methods."><a class="permalink" href="#Classes_and_inherited_methods.">Classes
  and inherited methods.</a></h2>
For modules which are not classes, this section is not relevant. This section is
  only relevant if you have methods which could be inherited.
<p class="Pp">A subroutine stub (or forward declaration) looks like</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  sub stub;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">i.e. it is a subroutine declaration without the body of the
    subroutine. For modules which are not classes, there is no real need for
    stubs as far as autoloading is concerned.</p>
<p class="Pp">For modules which ARE classes, and need to handle inherited
    methods, stubs are needed to ensure that the method inheritance mechanism
    works properly. You can load the stubs into the module at 'require' time, by
    adding the statement 'SelfLoader-&gt;<b>load_stubs()</b>;' to the module to
    do this.</p>
<p class="Pp">The alternative is to put the stubs in before the
    <span class="Li">&quot;__DATA__&quot;</span> token BEFORE releasing the
    module, and for this purpose the
    <span class="Li">&quot;Devel::SelfStubber&quot;</span> module is available.
    However this does require the extra step of ensuring that the stubs are in
    the module. If this is done I strongly recommend that this is done BEFORE
    releasing the module - it should NOT be done at install time in general.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="Multiple_packages_and_fully_qualified_subroutine_names"><a class="permalink" href="#Multiple_packages_and_fully_qualified_subroutine_names">Multiple
  packages and fully qualified subroutine names</a></h1>
Subroutines in multiple packages within the same file are supported - but you
  should note that this requires exporting the
  <span class="Li">&quot;SelfLoader::AUTOLOAD&quot;</span> to every package
  which requires it. This is done automatically by the <b>SelfLoader</b> when it
  first loads the subs into the cache, but you should really specify it in the
  initialization before the <span class="Li">&quot;__DATA__&quot;</span> by
  putting a 'use SelfLoader' statement in each package.
<p class="Pp">Fully qualified subroutine names are also supported. For
  example,</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
   __DATA__
   sub foo::bar {23}
   package baz;
   sub dob {32}
</pre>
<p class="Pp">will all be loaded correctly by the <b>SelfLoader</b>, and the
    <b>SelfLoader</b> will ensure that the packages 'foo' and 'baz' correctly
    have the <b>SelfLoader</b> <span class="Li">&quot;AUTOLOAD&quot;</span>
    method when the data after <span class="Li">&quot;__DATA__&quot;</span> is
    first parsed.</p>
