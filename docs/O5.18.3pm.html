   Set up some character translations and predefined strings.  \*(-- will
   give an unbreakable dash, \*(PI will give pi, \*(L" will give a left
   double quote, and \*(R" will give a right double quote.  \*(C+ will
   give a nicer C++.  Capital omega is used to do unbreakable dashes and
   therefore won't be available.  \*(C` and \*(C' expand to `' in nroff,
   nothing in troff, for use with C<>.

This is the module that is used as a frontend to the Perl Compiler.
<p class="Pp">If you pass the <span class="Li">&quot;-q&quot;</span> option to
    the module, then the STDOUT filehandle will be redirected into the variable
    <span class="Li">$O::BEGIN_output</span> during compilation. This has the
    effect that any output printed to STDOUT by BEGIN blocks or use'd modules
    will be stored in this variable rather than printed. It's useful with those
    backends which produce output themselves
    (<span class="Li">&quot;Deparse&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;Concise&quot;</span> etc), so that their output is
    not confused with that generated by the code being compiled.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;-qq&quot;</span> option behaves like
    <span class="Li">&quot;-q&quot;</span>, except that it also closes STDERR
    after deparsing has finished. This suppresses the &quot;Syntax OK&quot;
    message normally produced by perl.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="CONVENTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#CONVENTIONS">CONVENTIONS</a></h1>
Most compiler backends use the following conventions: OPTIONS consists of a
  comma-separated list of words (no white-space). The
  <span class="Li">&quot;-v&quot;</span> option usually puts the backend into
  verbose mode. The <span class="Li">&quot;-ofile&quot;</span> option generates
  output to <b>file</b> instead of stdout. The
  <span class="Li">&quot;-D&quot;</span> option followed by various letters
  turns on various internal debugging flags. See the documentation for the
  desired backend (named <span class="Li">&quot;B::Backend&quot;</span> for the
  example above) to find out about that backend.
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="IMPLEMENTATION"><a class="permalink" href="#IMPLEMENTATION">IMPLEMENTATION</a></h1>
This section is only necessary for those who want to write a compiler backend
  module that can be used via this module.
<p class="Pp">The command-line mentioned in the SYNOPSIS section corresponds to
    the Perl code</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    use O (&quot;Backend&quot;, OPTIONS);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;O::import&quot;</span> function loads
    the appropriate <span class="Li">&quot;B::Backend&quot;</span> module and
    calls its <span class="Li">&quot;compile&quot;</span> function, passing it
    OPTIONS. That function is expected to return a sub reference which we'll
    call CALLBACK. Next, the &quot;compile-only&quot; flag is switched on
    (equivalent to the command-line option
    <span class="Li">&quot;-c&quot;</span>) and a CHECK block is registered
    which calls CALLBACK. Thus the main Perl program mentioned on the
    command-line is read in, parsed and compiled into internal syntax tree form.
    Since the <span class="Li">&quot;-c&quot;</span> flag is set, the program
    does not start running (excepting BEGIN blocks of course) but the CALLBACK
    function registered by the compiler backend is called.</p>
<p class="Pp">In summary, a compiler backend module should be called
    &quot;B::Foo&quot; for some foo and live in the appropriate directory for
    that name. It should define a function called
    <span class="Li">&quot;compile&quot;</span>. When the user types</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    perl -MO=Foo,OPTIONS foo.pl
</pre>
<p class="Pp">that function is called and is passed those OPTIONS (split on
    commas). It should return a sub ref to the main compilation function. After
    the user's program is loaded and parsed, that returned sub ref is invoked
    which can then go ahead and do the compilation, usually by making use of the
    <span class="Li">&quot;B&quot;</span> module's functionality.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="BUGS"><a class="permalink" href="#BUGS">BUGS</a></h1>
The <span class="Li">&quot;-q&quot;</span> and
  <span class="Li">&quot;-qq&quot;</span> options don't work correctly if perl
  isn't compiled with PerlIO support : STDOUT will be closed instead of being
  redirected to <span class="Li">$O::BEGIN_output</span>.
