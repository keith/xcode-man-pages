   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

This man page presents an overview of Tcl objects and how they are used. It also
  describes generic procedures for managing Tcl objects. These procedures are
  used to create and copy objects, and increment and decrement the count of
  references (pointers) to objects. The procedures are used in conjunction with
  ones that operate on specific types of objects such as
  <b>Tcl_GetIntFromObj</b> and <b>Tcl_ListObjAppendElement</b>. The individual
  procedures are described along with the data structures they manipulate.
<p class="Pp">Tcl's <i>dual-ported</i> objects provide a general-purpose
    mechanism for storing and exchanging Tcl values. They largely replace the
    use of strings in Tcl. For example, they are used to store variable values,
    command arguments, command results, and scripts. Tcl objects behave like
    strings but also hold an internal representation that can be manipulated
    more efficiently. For example, a Tcl list is now represented as an object
    that holds the list's string representation as well as an array of pointers
    to the objects for each list element. Dual-ported objects avoid most runtime
    type conversions. They also improve the speed of many operations since an
    appropriate representation is immediately available. The compiler itself
    uses Tcl objects to cache the instruction bytecodes resulting from compiling
    scripts.</p>
<p class="Pp">The two representations are a cache of each other and are computed
    lazily. That is, each representation is only computed when necessary, it is
    computed from the other representation, and, once computed, it is saved. In
    addition, a change in one representation invalidates the other one. As an
    example, a Tcl program doing integer calculations can operate directly on a
    variable's internal machine integer representation without having to
    constantly convert between integers and strings. Only when it needs a string
    representing the variable's value, say to print it, will the program
    regenerate the string representation from the integer. Although objects
    contain an internal representation, their semantics are defined in terms of
    strings: an up-to-date string can always be obtained, and any change to the
    object will be reflected in that string when the object's string
    representation is fetched. Because of this representation invalidation and
    regeneration, it is dangerous for extension writers to access <b>Tcl_Obj</b>
    fields directly. It is better to access Tcl_Obj information using procedures
    like <b>Tcl_GetStringFromObj</b> and <b>Tcl_GetString</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Objects are allocated on the heap and are referenced using a
    pointer to their <b>Tcl_Obj</b> structure. Objects are shared as much as
    possible. This significantly reduces storage requirements because some
    objects such as long lists are very large. Also, most Tcl values are only
    read and never modified. This is especially true for procedure arguments,
    which can be shared between the caller and the called procedure. Assignment
    and argument binding is done by simply assigning a pointer to the value.
    Reference counting is used to determine when it is safe to reclaim an
    object's storage.</p>
<p class="Pp">Tcl objects are typed. An object's internal representation is
    controlled by its type. Several types are predefined in the Tcl core
    including integer, double, list, and bytecode. Extension writers can extend
    the set of types by defining their own <b>Tcl_ObjType</b> structs.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="THE_TCL_OBJ_STRUCTURE"><a class="permalink" href="#THE_TCL_OBJ_STRUCTURE">THE
  TCL_OBJ STRUCTURE</a></h1>
Each Tcl object is represented by a <b>Tcl_Obj</b> structure which is defined as
  follows.
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
typedef struct Tcl_Obj {
        int <i>refCount</i>;
        char *<i>bytes</i>;
        int <i>length</i>;
        Tcl_ObjType *<i>typePtr</i>;
        union {
                long <i>longValue</i>;
                double <i>doubleValue</i>;
                void *<i>otherValuePtr</i>;
                Tcl_WideInt <i>wideValue</i>;
                struct {
                        void *<i>ptr1</i>;
                        void *<i>ptr2</i>;
                } <i>twoPtrValue</i>;
                struct {
                        void *<i>ptr</i>;
                        unsigned long <i>value</i>;
                } <i>ptrAndLongRep</i>;
        } <i>internalRep</i>;
} Tcl_Obj;
</pre>
</div>
The <i>bytes</i> and the <i>length</i> members together hold an object's UTF-8
  string representation, which is a <i>counted string</i> not containing null
  bytes (UTF-8 null characters should be encoded as a two byte sequence: 192,
  128.) <i>bytes</i> points to the first byte of the string representation. The
  <i>length</i> member gives the number of bytes. The byte array must always
  have a null byte after the last data byte, at offset <i>length</i>; this
  allows string representations to be treated as conventional null-terminated C
  strings. C programs use <b>Tcl_GetStringFromObj</b> and <b>Tcl_GetString</b>
  to get an object's string representation. If <i>bytes</i> is NULL, the string
  representation is invalid.
<p class="Pp">An object's type manages its internal representation. The member
    <i>typePtr</i> points to the Tcl_ObjType structure that describes the type.
    If <i>typePtr</i> is NULL, the internal representation is invalid.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>internalRep</i> union member holds an object's internal
    representation. This is either a (long) integer, a double-precision
    floating-point number, a pointer to a value containing additional
    information needed by the object's type to represent the object, a
    Tcl_WideInt integer, two arbitrary pointers, or a pair made up of an
    unsigned long integer and a pointer.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>refCount</i> member is used to tell when it is safe to free
    an object's storage. It holds the count of active references to the object.
    Maintaining the correct reference count is a key responsibility of extension
    writers. Reference counting is discussed below in the section <b>STORAGE
    MANAGEMENT OF OBJECTS</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Although extension writers can directly access the members of a
    Tcl_Obj structure, it is much better to use the appropriate procedures and
    macros. For example, extension writers should never read or update
    <i>refCount</i> directly; they should use macros such as
    <b>Tcl_IncrRefCount</b> and <b>Tcl_IsShared</b> instead.</p>
<p class="Pp">A key property of Tcl objects is that they hold two
    representations. An object typically starts out containing only a string
    representation: it is untyped and has a NULL <i>typePtr</i>. An object
    containing an empty string or a copy of a specified string is created using
    <b>Tcl_NewObj</b> or <b>Tcl_NewStringObj</b> respectively. An object's
    string value is gotten with <b>Tcl_GetStringFromObj</b> or
    <b>Tcl_GetString</b> and changed with <b>Tcl_SetStringObj</b>. If the object
    is later passed to a procedure like <b>Tcl_GetIntFromObj</b> that requires a
    specific internal representation, the procedure will create one and set the
    object's <i>typePtr</i>. The internal representation is computed from the
    string representation. An object's two representations are duals of each
    other: changes made to one are reflected in the other. For example,
    <b>Tcl_ListObjReplace</b> will modify an object's internal representation
    and the next call to <b>Tcl_GetStringFromObj</b> or <b>Tcl_GetString</b>
    will reflect that change.</p>
<p class="Pp">Representations are recomputed lazily for efficiency. A change to
    one representation made by a procedure such as <b>Tcl_ListObjReplace</b> is
    not reflected immediately in the other representation. Instead, the other
    representation is marked invalid so that it is only regenerated if it is
    needed later. Most C programmers never have to be concerned with how this is
    done and simply use procedures such as <b>Tcl_GetBooleanFromObj</b> or
    <b>Tcl_ListObjIndex</b>. Programmers that implement their own object types
    must check for invalid representations and mark representations invalid when
    necessary. The procedure <b>Tcl_InvalidateStringRep</b> is used to mark an
    object's string representation invalid and to free any storage associated
    with the old string representation.</p>
<p class="Pp">Objects usually remain one type over their life, but occasionally
    an object must be converted from one type to another. For example, a C
    program might build up a string in an object with repeated calls to
    <b>Tcl_AppendToObj</b>, and then call <b>Tcl_ListObjIndex</b> to extract a
    list element from the object. The same object holding the same string value
    can have several different internal representations at different times.
    Extension writers can also force an object to be converted from one type to
    another using the <b>Tcl_ConvertToType</b> procedure. Only programmers that
    create new object types need to be concerned about how this is done. A
    procedure defined as part of the object type's implementation creates a new
    internal representation for an object and changes its <i>typePtr</i>. See
    the man page for <b>Tcl_RegisterObjType</b> to see how to create a new
    object type.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="EXAMPLE_OF_THE_LIFETIME_OF_AN_OBJECT"><a class="permalink" href="#EXAMPLE_OF_THE_LIFETIME_OF_AN_OBJECT">EXAMPLE
  OF THE LIFETIME OF AN OBJECT</a></h1>
As an example of the lifetime of an object, consider the following sequence of
  commands:
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b>set x 123</b>
</pre>
</div>
This assigns to <i>x</i> an untyped object whose <i>bytes</i> member points to
  <b>123</b> and <i>length</i> member contains 3. The object's <i>typePtr</i>
  member is NULL.
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b>puts &quot;x is $x&quot;</b>
</pre>
</div>
<i>x</i>'s string representation is valid (since <i>bytes</i> is non-NULL) and
  is fetched for the command.
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b>incr x</b>
</pre>
</div>
The <b>incr</b> command first gets an integer from <i>x</i>'s object by calling
  <b>Tcl_GetIntFromObj</b>. This procedure checks whether the object is already
  an integer object. Since it is not, it converts the object by setting the
  object's <i>internalRep.longValue</i> member to the integer <b>123</b> and
  setting the object's <i>typePtr</i> to point to the integer Tcl_ObjType
  structure. Both representations are now valid. <b>incr</b> increments the
  object's integer internal representation then invalidates its string
  representation (by calling <b>Tcl_InvalidateStringRep</b>) since the string
  representation no longer corresponds to the internal representation.
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b>puts &quot;x is now $x&quot;</b>
</pre>
</div>
The string representation of <i>x</i>'s object is needed and is recomputed. The
  string representation is now <b>124</b> and both representations are again
  valid.
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="STORAGE_MANAGEMENT_OF_OBJECTS"><a class="permalink" href="#STORAGE_MANAGEMENT_OF_OBJECTS">STORAGE
  MANAGEMENT OF OBJECTS</a></h1>
Tcl objects are allocated on the heap and are shared as much as possible to
  reduce storage requirements. Reference counting is used to determine when an
  object is no longer needed and can safely be freed. An object just created by
  <b>Tcl_NewObj</b> or <b>Tcl_NewStringObj</b> has <i>refCount</i> 0. The macro
  <b>Tcl_IncrRefCount</b> increments the reference count when a new reference to
  the object is created. The macro <b>Tcl_DecrRefCount</b> decrements the count
  when a reference is no longer needed and, if the object's reference count
  drops to zero, frees its storage. An object shared by different code or data
  structures has <i>refCount</i> greater than 1. Incrementing an object's
  reference count ensures that it will not be freed too early or have its value
  change accidentally.
<p class="Pp">As an example, the bytecode interpreter shares argument objects
    between calling and called Tcl procedures to avoid having to copy objects.
    It assigns the call's argument objects to the procedure's formal parameter
    variables. In doing so, it calls <b>Tcl_IncrRefCount</b> to increment the
    reference count of each argument since there is now a new reference to it
    from the formal parameter. When the called procedure returns, the
    interpreter calls <b>Tcl_DecrRefCount</b> to decrement each argument's
    reference count. When an object's reference count drops less than or equal
    to zero, <b>Tcl_DecrRefCount</b> reclaims its storage. Most command
    procedures do not have to be concerned about reference counting since they
    use an object's value immediately and do not retain a pointer to the object
    after they return. However, if they do retain a pointer to an object in a
    data structure, they must be careful to increment its reference count since
    the retained pointer is a new reference.</p>
<p class="Pp">Command procedures that directly modify objects such as those for
    <b>lappend</b> and <b>linsert</b> must be careful to copy a shared object
    before changing it. They must first check whether the object is shared by
    calling <b>Tcl_IsShared</b>. If the object is shared they must copy the
    object by using <b>Tcl_DuplicateObj</b>; this returns a new duplicate of the
    original object that has <i>refCount</i> 0. If the object is not shared, the
    command procedure &#x201C;owns&#x201D; the object and can safely modify it
    directly. For example, the following code appears in the command procedure
    that implements <b>linsert</b>. This procedure modifies the list object
    passed to it in <i>objv[1]</i> by inserting <i>objc-3</i> new elements
    before <i>index</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
listPtr = objv[1];
if (Tcl_IsShared(listPtr)) {
    listPtr = Tcl_DuplicateObj(listPtr);
}
result = Tcl_ListObjReplace(interp, listPtr, index, 0,
        (objc-3), &amp;(objv[3]));
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">As another example, <b>incr</b>'s command procedure must check
    whether the variable's object is shared before incrementing the integer in
    its internal representation. If it is shared, it needs to duplicate the
    object in order to avoid accidentally changing values in other data
    structures.</p>
