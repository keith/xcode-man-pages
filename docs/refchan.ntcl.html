   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

  .b
  	# define tabbing values for .AP
  
  	# BS - start boxed text
  	# ^y = starting y location
  	# ^b = 1
  	# BE - end boxed text (draw box now)

  	box if the box started on an earlier page.
  	# VS - start vertical sidebar
  	# ^Y = starting y location
  	# ^v = 1 (for troff;  for nroff this doesn't matter)
  	# VE - end of vertical sidebar

The Tcl-level handler for a reflected channel has to be a command with
  subcommands (termed an <i>ensemble</i>, as it is a command such as that
  created by <b>namespace ensemble create</b>, though the implementation of
  handlers for reflected channel <i>is not</i> tied to <b>namespace</b>
  <b>ensemble</b>s in any way). Note that <i>cmdPrefix</i> is whatever was
  specified in the call to <b>chan create</b>, and may consist of multiple
  arguments; this will be expanded to multiple words in place of the prefix.
<p class="Pp">Of all the possible subcommands, the handler <i>must</i> support
    <b>initialize</b>, <b>finalize</b>, and <b>watch</b>. Support for the other
    subcommands is optional.</p>
<section class="Ss">

  SUBCOMMANDS</a></h2>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><i>cmdPrefix </i><b>initialize </b><i>channelId mode</i></dt>
  <dd>An invocation of this subcommand will be the first call the
      <i>cmdPrefix</i> will receive for the specified new <i>channelId</i>. It
      is the responsibility of this subcommand to set up any internal data
      structures required to keep track of the channel and its state.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">The return value of the method has to be a list containing the
    names of all subcommands supported by the <i>cmdPrefix</i>. This also tells
    the Tcl core which version of the API for reflected channels is used by this
    command handler.</p>
<p class="Pp">Any error thrown by the method will abort the creation of the
    channel and no channel will be created. The thrown error will appear as
    error thrown by <b>chan create</b>. Any exception other than an <b>error</b>
    (e.g. <b>break</b>, etc.) is treated as (and converted to) an error.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Note:</b> If the creation of the channel was aborted due to
    failures here, then the <b>finalize</b> subcommand will not be called.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>mode</i> argument tells the handler whether the channel was
    opened for reading, writing, or both. It is a list containing any of the
    strings <b>read</b> or <b>write</b>. The list will always contain at least
    one element.</p>
<p class="Pp">The subcommand must throw an error if the chosen mode is not
    supported by the <i>cmdPrefix</i>.</p>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><i>cmdPrefix </i><b>finalize </b><i>channelId</i></dt>
  <dd>An invocation of this subcommand will be the last call the
      <i>cmdPrefix</i> will receive for the specified <i>channelId</i>. It will
      be generated just before the destruction of the data structures of the
      channel held by the Tcl core. The command handler <i>must not</i> access
      the <i>channelId</i> anymore in no way. Upon this subcommand being called,
      any internal resources allocated to this channel must be cleaned up.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">The return value of this subcommand is ignored.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the subcommand throws an error the command which caused its
    invocation (usually <b>close</b>) will appear to have thrown this error. Any
    exception beyond <i>error</i> (e.g. <i>break</i>, etc.) is treated as (and
    converted to) an error.</p>
<p class="Pp">This subcommand is not invoked if the creation of the channel was
    aborted during <b>initialize</b> (See above).</p>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><i>cmdPrefix </i><b>watch </b><i>channelId eventspec</i></dt>
  <dd>This subcommand notifies the <i>cmdPrefix</i> that the specified
      <i>channelId</i> is interested in the events listed in the
      <i>eventspec</i>. This argument is a list containing any of <b>read</b>
      and <b>write</b>. The list may be empty, which signals that the channel
      does not wish to be notified of any events. In that situation, the handler
      should disable event generation completely.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp"><b>Warning:</b> Any return value of the subcommand is ignored.
    This includes all errors thrown by the subcommand, break, continue, and
    custom return codes.</p>
<p class="Pp">This subcommand interacts with <b>chan postevent</b>. Trying to
    post an event which was not listed in the last call to <b>watch</b> will
    cause <b>chan postevent</b> to throw an error.</p>

  SUBCOMMANDS</a></h2>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><i>cmdPrefix </i><b>read </b><i>channelId count</i></dt>
  <dd>This <i>optional</i> subcommand is called when the user requests data from
      the channel <i>channelId</i>. <i>count</i> specifies how many <b>bytes</b>
      have been requested. If the subcommand is not supported then it is not
      possible to read from the channel handled by the command.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">The return value of this subcommand is taken as the requested data
    <i>bytes</i>. If the returned data contains more bytes than requested, an
    error will be signaled and later thrown by the command which performed the
    read (usually <b>gets</b> or <b>read</b>). However, returning fewer bytes
    than requested is acceptable.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that returning nothing (0 bytes) is a signal to the higher
    layers that <b>EOF</b> has been reached on the channel. To signal that the
    channel is out of data right now, but has not yet reached <b>EOF</b>, it is
    necessary to throw the error &quot;EAGAIN&quot;, i.e. to either</p>

<p class="Pp">For extensibility any error whose value is a negative integer
    number will cause the higher layers to set the C-level variable
    &quot;<b>errno</b>&quot; to the absolute value of this number, signaling a
    system error. This means that both</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">

and
<div class="Bd-indent">

</div>
<p class="Pp">are equivalent to the examples above, using the more readable
    string &quot;EAGAIN&quot;. No other error value has such a mapping to a
    symbolic string.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the subcommand throws any other error, the command which caused
    its invocation (usually <b>gets</b>, or <b>read</b>) will appear to have
    thrown this error. Any exception beyond <i>error</i>, (e.g. <i>break</i>,
    etc.) is treated as and converted to an error.</p>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><i>cmdPrefix </i><b>write </b><i>channelId data</i></dt>
  <dd>This <i>optional</i> subcommand is called when the user writes data to the
      channel <i>channelId</i>. The <i>data</i> argument contains <i>bytes</i>,
      not characters. Any type of transformation (EOL, encoding) configured for
      the channel has already been applied at this point. If this subcommand is
      not supported then it is not possible to write to the channel handled by
      the command.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">The return value of the subcommand is taken as the number of bytes
    written by the channel. Anything non-numeric will cause an error to be
    signaled and later thrown by the command which performed the write. A
    negative value implies that the write failed. Returning a value greater than
    the number of bytes given to the handler, or zero, is forbidden and will
    cause the Tcl core to throw an error.</p>
<p class="Pp">To signal that the channel is not able to accept data for writing
    right now, it is necessary to throw the error &quot;EAGAIN&quot;, i.e. to
    either</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">

    number will cause the higher layers to set the C-level variable
    &quot;<b>errno</b>&quot; to the absolute value of this number, signaling a
    system error. However, note that the exact mapping between these error
    numbers and their meanings is operating system dependent.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, while on Linux both</p>

<div class="Bd-indent">

    number is -35.</p>
<p class="Pp">The symbolic string however is the same across systems, and
    internally translated to the correct number. No other error value has such a
    mapping to a symbolic string.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the subcommand throws any other error the command which caused
    its invocation (usually <b>puts</b>) will appear to have thrown this error.

<p class="Pp">The <i>base</i> argument of the builtin <b>chan seek</b> command

<p class="Pp">The <i>offset</i> is an integer number specifying the amount of
    <b>bytes</b> to seek forward or backward. A positive number should seek
    forward, and a negative number should seek backward.</p>
<p class="Pp">A channel may provide only limited seeking. For example sockets
    can seek forward, but not backward.</p>
<p class="Pp">The return value of the subcommand is taken as the (new) location
    of the channel, counted from the start. This has to be an integer number
    greater than or equal to zero.</p>

Some of the functions supported in channels defined in Tcl's C interface are not
  available to channels reflected to the Tcl level.
<p class="Pp">The function <b>Tcl_DriverGetHandleProc</b> is not supported; i.e.
    reflected channels do not have OS specific handles.</p>
<p class="Pp">The function <b>Tcl_DriverHandlerProc</b> is not supported. This
    driver function is relevant only for stacked channels, i.e. transformations.
    Reflected channels are always base channels, not transformations.</p>
<p class="Pp">The function <b>Tcl_DriverFlushProc</b> is not supported. This is
    because the current generic I/O layer of Tcl does not use this function
    anywhere at all. Therefore support at the Tcl level makes no sense either.
    This may be altered in the future (through extending the API defined here
    and changing its version number) should the function be used at some time in
    the future.</p>
