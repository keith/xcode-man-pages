<p class="Pp">When using libcurl's &quot;easy&quot; interface you init your
    session and get a handle (often referred to as an &quot;easy handle&quot;),
    which you use as input to the easy interface functions you use. Use
    <i>curl_easy_init(3)</i> to get the handle.</p>
<p class="Pp">You continue by setting all the options you want in the upcoming
    transfer, the most important among them is the URL itself (you cannot
    transfer anything without a specified URL as you may have figured out
    yourself). You might want to set some callbacks as well that will be called
    from the library when data is available etc. <i>curl_easy_setopt(3)</i> is
    used for all this.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>CURLOPT_URL(3)</i> is the only option you really must set, as
    otherwise there can be no transfer. Another commonly used option is
    <i>CURLOPT_VERBOSE(3)</i> that will help you see what libcurl is doing under
    the hood, which is useful when debugging for example. The
    <i>curl_easy_setopt(3)</i> man page has a full index of the almost 300
    available options.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you at any point would like to blank all previously set options
    for a single easy handle, you can call <i>curl_easy_reset(3)</i> and you can
    also make a clone of an easy handle (with all its set options) using
    <i>curl_easy_duphandle(3)</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">When all is setup, you tell libcurl to perform the transfer using
    <i>curl_easy_perform(3)</i>. It will then do the entire operation and will
    not return until it is done (successfully or not).</p>
<p class="Pp">After the transfer has been made, you can set new options and make
    another transfer, or if you are done, cleanup the session by calling
    <i>curl_easy_cleanup(3)</i>. If you want persistent connections, you do not
    cleanup immediately, but instead run ahead and perform other transfers using
    the same easy handle.</p>
