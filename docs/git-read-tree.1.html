Reads the tree information given by &lt;tree-ish&gt; into the index, but does
  not actually <b>update</b> any of the files it &quot;caches&quot;. (see:
  <b>git-checkout-index</b>(1))
<p class="Pp">Optionally, it can merge a tree into the index, perform a
    fast-forward (i.e. 2-way) merge, or a 3-way merge, with the <b>-m</b> flag.
    When used with <b>-m</b>, the <b>-u</b> flag causes it to also update the
    files in the work tree with the result of the merge.</p>
<p class="Pp">Trivial merges are done by <i>git read-tree</i> itself. Only
    conflicting paths will be in unmerged state when <i>git read-tree</i>
    returns.</p>

-m
<div class="Bd-indent">Perform a merge, not just a read. The command will refuse
  to run if your index file has unmerged entries, indicating that you have not
  finished previous merge you started.</div>
<p class="Pp">--reset</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Same as -m, except that unmerged entries are discarded
  instead of failing.</div>
<p class="Pp">-u</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">After a successful merge, update the files in the work
  tree with the result of the merge.</div>
<p class="Pp">-i</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Usually a merge requires the index file as well as the
  files in the working tree to be up to date with the current head commit, in
  order not to lose local changes. This flag disables the check with the working
  tree and is meant to be used when creating a merge of trees that are not
  directly related to the current working tree status into a temporary index
  file.</div>
<p class="Pp">-n, --dry-run</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Check if the command would error out, without updating
  the index or the files in the working tree for real.</div>
<p class="Pp">-v</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show the progress of checking files out.</div>
<p class="Pp">--trivial</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Restrict three-way merge by <i>git read-tree</i> to
  happen only if there is no file-level merging required, instead of resolving
  merge for trivial cases and leaving conflicting files unresolved in the
  index.</div>
<p class="Pp">--aggressive</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Usually a three-way merge by <i>git read-tree</i>
  resolves the merge for really trivial cases and leaves other cases unresolved
  in the index, so that porcelains can implement different merge policies. This
  flag makes the command resolve a few more cases internally:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;when one side removes a path and the other side
  leaves the path unmodified. The resolution is to remove that path.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;when both sides remove a path. The resolution is
  to remove that path.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;when both sides add a path identically. The
  resolution is to add that path.</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--prefix=&lt;prefix&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Keep the current index contents, and read the contents of
  the named tree-ish under the directory at <b>&lt;prefix&gt;</b>. The command
  will refuse to overwrite entries that already existed in the original index
  file.</div>
<p class="Pp">--exclude-per-directory=&lt;gitignore&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When running the command with <b>-u</b> and <b>-m</b>
  options, the merge result may need to overwrite paths that are not tracked in
  the current branch. The command usually refuses to proceed with the merge to
  avoid losing such a path. However this safety valve sometimes gets in the way.
  For example, it often happens that the other branch added a file that used to
  be a generated file in your branch, and the safety valve triggers when you try
  to switch to that branch after you ran <b>make</b> but before running <b>make
  clean</b> to remove the generated file. This option tells the command to read
  per-directory exclude file (usually <i>.gitignore</i>) and allows such an
  untracked but explicitly ignored file to be overwritten.</div>
<p class="Pp">--index-output=&lt;file&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Instead of writing the results out to
  <b>$GIT_INDEX_FILE</b>, write the resulting index in the named file. While the
  command is operating, the original index file is locked with the same
  mechanism as usual. The file must allow to be rename(2)ed into from a
  temporary file that is created next to the usual index file; typically this
  means it needs to be on the same filesystem as the index file itself, and you
  need write permission to the directories the index file and index output file
  are located in.</div>
<p class="Pp">--[no-]recurse-submodules</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Using --recurse-submodules will update the content of all
  initialized submodules according to the commit recorded in the superproject by
  calling read-tree recursively, also setting the submodules HEAD to be detached
  at that commit.</div>
<p class="Pp">--no-sparse-checkout</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Disable sparse checkout support even if
  <b>core.sparseCheckout</b> is true.</div>
<p class="Pp">--empty</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Instead of reading tree object(s) into the index, just
  empty it.</div>

If <b>-m</b> is specified, <i>git read-tree</i> can perform 3 kinds of merge, a
  single tree merge if only 1 tree is given, a fast-forward merge with 2 trees,
  or a 3-way merge if 3 or more trees are provided.
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Single_Tree_Merge"><a class="permalink" href="#Single_Tree_Merge">Single
  Tree Merge</a></h2>
If only 1 tree is specified, <i>git read-tree</i> operates as if the user did
  not specify <b>-m</b>, except that if the original index has an entry for a
  given pathname, and the contents of the path match with the tree being read,
  the stat info from the index is used. (In other words, the index&#x2019;s
  stat()s take precedence over the merged tree&#x2019;s).
<p class="Pp">That means that if you do a <b>git read-tree -m
    &lt;newtree&gt;</b> followed by a <b>git checkout-index -f -u -a</b>, the
    <i>git checkout-index</i> only checks out the stuff that really changed.</p>
<p class="Pp">This is used to avoid unnecessary false hits when <i>git
    diff-files</i> is run after <i>git read-tree</i>.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Two_Tree_Merge"><a class="permalink" href="#Two_Tree_Merge">Two
  Tree Merge</a></h2>
Typically, this is invoked as <b>git read-tree -m $H $M</b>, where $H is the
  head commit of the current repository, and $M is the head of a foreign tree,
  which is simply ahead of $H (i.e. we are in a fast-forward situation).
<p class="Pp">When two trees are specified, the user is telling <i>git
    read-tree</i> the following:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 1.The current index and work tree is derived from $H,
  but the user may have local changes in them since $H.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 2.The user wants to fast-forward to $M.</div>
<p class="Pp">In this case, the <b>git read-tree -m $H $M</b> command makes sure
    that no local change is lost as the result of this &quot;merge&quot;. Here
    are the &quot;carry forward&quot; rules, where &quot;I&quot; denotes the
    index, &quot;clean&quot; means that index and work tree coincide, and
    &quot;exists&quot;/&quot;nothing&quot; refer to the presence of a path in
    the specified commit:</p>

</div>
<p class="Pp">In all &quot;keep index&quot; cases, the index entry stays as in
    the original index file. If the entry is not up to date, <i>git
    read-tree</i> keeps the copy in the work tree intact when operating under
    the -u flag.</p>
<p class="Pp">When this form of <i>git read-tree</i> returns successfully, you
    can see which of the &quot;local changes&quot; that you made were carried
    forward by running <b>git diff-index --cached $M</b>. Note that this does
    not necessarily match what <b>git diff-index --cached $H</b> would have
    produced before such a two tree merge. This is because of cases 18 and 19
    --- if you already had the changes in $M (e.g. maybe you picked it up via
    e-mail in a patch form), <b>git diff-index --cached $H</b> would have told
    you about the change before this merge, but it would not show in <b>git
    diff-index --cached $M</b> output after the two-tree merge.</p>
<p class="Pp">Case 3 is slightly tricky and needs explanation. The result from
    this rule logically should be to remove the path if the user staged the
    removal of the path and then switching to a new branch. That however will
    prevent the initial checkout from happening, so the rule is modified to use
    M (new tree) only when the content of the index is empty. Otherwise the
    removal of the path is kept as long as $H and $M are the same.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="3_-Way_Merge"><a class="permalink" href="#3_-Way_Merge">3-Way
  Merge</a></h2>
Each &quot;index&quot; entry has two bits worth of &quot;stage&quot; state.
  stage 0 is the normal one, and is the only one you&#x2019;d see in any kind of
  normal use.
<p class="Pp">However, when you do <i>git read-tree</i> with three trees, the
    &quot;stage&quot; starts out at 1.</p>
<p class="Pp">This means that you can do</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ git read-tree -m &lt;tree1&gt; &lt;tree2&gt; &lt;tree3&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">and you will end up with an index with all of the &lt;tree1&gt;
    entries in &quot;stage1&quot;, all of the &lt;tree2&gt; entries in
    &quot;stage2&quot; and all of the &lt;tree3&gt; entries in
    &quot;stage3&quot;. When performing a merge of another branch into the
    current branch, we use the common ancestor tree as &lt;tree1&gt;, the
    current branch head as &lt;tree2&gt;, and the other branch head as
    &lt;tree3&gt;.</p>
<p class="Pp">Furthermore, <i>git read-tree</i> has special-case logic that
    says: if you see a file that matches in all respects in the following
    states, it &quot;collapses&quot; back to &quot;stage0&quot;:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;stage 2 and 3 are the same; take one or the other
  (it makes no difference - the same work has been done on our branch in stage 2
  and their branch in stage 3)</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;stage 1 and stage 2 are the same and stage 3 is
  different; take stage 3 (our branch in stage 2 did not do anything since the
  ancestor in stage 1 while their branch in stage 3 worked on it)</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;stage 1 and stage 3 are the same and stage 2 is
  different take stage 2 (we did something while they did nothing)</div>
<p class="Pp">The <i>git write-tree</i> command refuses to write a nonsensical
    tree, and it will complain about unmerged entries if it sees a single entry
    that is not stage 0.</p>
<p class="Pp">OK, this all sounds like a collection of totally nonsensical
    rules, but it&#x2019;s actually exactly what you want in order to do a fast
    merge. The different stages represent the &quot;result tree&quot; (stage 0,
    aka &quot;merged&quot;), the original tree (stage 1, aka &quot;orig&quot;),
    and the two trees you are trying to merge (stage 2 and 3 respectively).</p>
<p class="Pp">The order of stages 1, 2 and 3 (hence the order of three
    &lt;tree-ish&gt; command-line arguments) are significant when you start a
    3-way merge with an index file that is already populated. Here is an outline
    of how the algorithm works:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;if a file exists in identical format in all three
  trees, it will automatically collapse to &quot;merged&quot; state by <i>git
  read-tree</i>.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;a file that has <i>any</i> difference
  what-so-ever in the three trees will stay as separate entries in the index.
  It&#x2019;s up to &quot;porcelain policy&quot; to determine how to remove the
  non-0 stages, and insert a merged version.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;the index file saves and restores with all this
  information, so you can merge things incrementally, but as long as it has
  entries in stages 1/2/3 (i.e., &quot;unmerged entries&quot;) you can&#x2019;t
  write the result. So now the merge algorithm ends up being really simple:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;you walk the index in order, and ignore all
  entries of stage 0, since they&#x2019;ve already been done.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;if you find a &quot;stage1&quot;, but no matching
  &quot;stage2&quot; or &quot;stage3&quot;, you know it&#x2019;s been removed
  from both trees (it only existed in the original tree), and you remove that
  entry.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;if you find a matching &quot;stage2&quot; and
  &quot;stage3&quot; tree, you remove one of them, and turn the other into a
  &quot;stage0&quot; entry. Remove any matching &quot;stage1&quot; entry if it
  exists too. .. all the normal trivial rules ..</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp">You would normally use <i>git merge-index</i> with supplied <i>git
    merge-one-file</i> to do this last step. The script updates the files in the
    working tree as it merges each path and at the end of a successful
  merge.</p>
<p class="Pp">When you start a 3-way merge with an index file that is already
    populated, it is assumed that it represents the state of the files in your
    work tree, and you can even have files with changes unrecorded in the index
    file. It is further assumed that this state is &quot;derived&quot; from the
    stage 2 tree. The 3-way merge refuses to run if it finds an entry in the
    original index file that does not match stage 2.</p>
<p class="Pp">This is done to prevent you from losing your work-in-progress
    changes, and mixing your random changes in an unrelated merge commit. To
    illustrate, suppose you start from what has been committed last to your
    repository:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ JC=`git rev-parse --verify &quot;HEAD^0&quot;`
$ git checkout-index -f -u -a $JC
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">You do random edits, without running <i>git update-index</i>. And
    then you notice that the tip of your &quot;upstream&quot; tree has advanced
    since you pulled from him:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ git fetch git://.... linus
$ LT=`git rev-parse FETCH_HEAD`
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">Your work tree is still based on your HEAD ($JC), but you have
    some edits since. Three-way merge makes sure that you have not added or
    modified index entries since $JC, and if you haven&#x2019;t, then does the
    right thing. So with the following sequence:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ git read-tree -m -u `git merge-base $JC $LT` $JC $LT
$ git merge-index git-merge-one-file -a
$ echo &quot;Merge with Linus&quot; | \
  git commit-tree `git write-tree` -p $JC -p $LT
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">what you would commit is a pure merge between $JC and $LT without
    your work-in-progress changes, and your work tree would be updated to the
    result of the merge.</p>
<p class="Pp">However, if you have local changes in the working tree that would
    be overwritten by this merge, <i>git read-tree</i> will refuse to run to
    prevent your changes from being lost.</p>
<p class="Pp">In other words, there is no need to worry about what exists only
    in the working tree. When you have local changes in a part of the project
    that is not involved in the merge, your changes do not interfere with the
    merge, and are kept intact. When they <b>do</b> interfere, the merge does
    not even start (<i>git read-tree</i> complains loudly and fails without
    modifying anything). In such a case, you can simply continue doing what you
    were in the middle of doing, and when your working tree is ready (i.e. you
    have finished your work-in-progress), attempt the merge again.</p>
</section>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="SPARSE_CHECKOUT"><a class="permalink" href="#SPARSE_CHECKOUT">SPARSE
  CHECKOUT</a></h1>
&quot;Sparse checkout&quot; allows populating the working directory sparsely. It
  uses the skip-worktree bit (see <b>git-update-index</b>(1)) to tell Git
  whether a file in the working directory is worth looking at.
<p class="Pp"><i>git read-tree</i> and other merge-based commands (<i>git
    merge</i>, <i>git checkout</i>...) can help maintaining the skip-worktree
    bitmap and working directory update. <b>$GIT_DIR/info/sparse-checkout</b> is
    used to define the skip-worktree reference bitmap. When <i>git read-tree</i>
    needs to update the working directory, it resets the skip-worktree bit in
    the index based on this file, which uses the same syntax as .gitignore
    files. If an entry matches a pattern in this file, skip-worktree will not be
    set on that entry. Otherwise, skip-worktree will be set.</p>
<p class="Pp">Then it compares the new skip-worktree value with the previous
    one. If skip-worktree turns from set to unset, it will add the corresponding
    file back. If it turns from unset to set, that file will be removed.</p>
<p class="Pp">While <b>$GIT_DIR/info/sparse-checkout</b> is usually used to
    specify what files are in, you can also specify what files are <i>not</i>
    in, using negate patterns. For example, to remove the file
  <b>unwanted</b>:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
/*
!unwanted
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">Another tricky thing is fully repopulating the working directory
    when you no longer want sparse checkout. You cannot just disable
    &quot;sparse checkout&quot; because skip-worktree bits are still in the
    index and your working directory is still sparsely populated. You should
    re-populate the working directory with the
    <b>$GIT_DIR/info/sparse-checkout</b> file content as follows:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
/*
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">Then you can disable sparse checkout. Sparse checkout support in
    <i>git read-tree</i> and similar commands is disabled by default. You need
    to turn <b>core.sparseCheckout</b> on in order to have sparse checkout
    support.</p>
