Even though Net::Server::HTTP doesn't fall into the normal parallel of the other
  Net::Server flavors, handling HTTP requests is an often requested feature and
  is a standard and simple protocol.
<p class="Pp">Net::Server::HTTP begins with base type MultiType defaulting to
    Net::Server::Fork. It is easy to change it to any of the other Net::Server
    flavors by passing server_type =&gt; <span class="Li">$other_flavor</span>
    in the server configurtation. The port has also been defaulted to port 80 -
    but could easily be changed to another through the server configuration. You
    can also very easily add ssl by including, proto=&gt;&quot;ssl&quot; and
    provide a SSL_cert_file and SSL_key_file.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, here is a basic server that will bind to all
    interfaces, will speak both HTTP on port 8080 as well as HTTPS on 8443, and
    will speak both IPv4, as well as IPv6 if it is available.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    use base qw(Net::Server::HTTP);

    __PACKAGE__-&gt;run(
        port  =&gt; [8080, &quot;8443/ssl&quot;],
        ipv   =&gt; '*', # IPv6 if available
        SSL_key_file  =&gt; '/my/key',
        SSL_cert_file =&gt; '/my/cert',
    );

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>&quot;_init_access_log&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Used to open and initialize any requested access_log (see access_log_file
      and access_log_format).</dd>
  <dt>&quot;_tie_client_stdout&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Used to initialize automatic response header parsing.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;process_http_request&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Will be passed the client handle, and will have STDOUT and STDIN tied to
      the client.
    <p class="Pp">During this method, the <span class="Li">%ENV</span> will have
        been set to a standard CGI style environment. You will need to be sure
        to print the Content-type header. This is one change from the other
        standard Net::Server base classes.</p>
    <p class="Pp">During this method you can read from
        <span class="Li">%ENV</span> and STDIN just like a normal HTTP request
        in other web servers. You can print to STDOUT and Net::Server will
        handle the header negotiation for you.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note: Net::Server::HTTP has no concept of document root or
        script aliases or default handling of static content. That is up to the
        consumer of Net::Server::HTTP to work out.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Net::Server::HTTP comes with a basic
        <span class="Li">%ENV</span> display installed as the default
        process_http_request method.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>&quot;process_request&quot;</dt>
  <dd>This method has been overridden in Net::Server::HTTP - you should not use
      it while using Net::Server::HTTP. This overridden method parses the
      environment and sets up request alarms and handles dying failures. It
      calls process_http_request once the request is ready and headers have been
      parsed.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;process_headers&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Used to read in the incoming headers and set the ENV.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;_init_http_request_info&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Called at the end of process_headers. Initializes the contents of
      http_request_info.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;http_request_info&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Returns a hashref of information specific to the current request. This
      information will be used for logging later on.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;send_status&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Takes an HTTP status and a message. Sends out the correct headers.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;send_500&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Calls send_status with 500 and the argument passed to send_500.</dd>
  <dt>c&lt;log_http_request&gt;</dt>
  <dd>Called at the end of post_process_request. The default method looks for
      the default access_log_format and checks if logging was initilized during
      _init_access_log. If both of these exist, the http_request_info is
      formatted using http_log_format and the result is logged.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;http_log_format&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Takes a format string, and request_info and returns a formatted string.
      The format should follow the apache mod_log_config specification. As in
      the mod_log_config specification, backslashes, quotes should be escaped
      with backslashes and you may also include \n and \t characters as well.
    <p class="Pp">The following is a listing of the available parameters as well
        as sample output based on a very basic HTTP server.</p>

      passed a dispatch qr (regular expression) generated during
      _check_dispatch, and a dispatch table. The qr will be applied to

In addition to the command line arguments of the Net::Server base classes you
  can also set the following options.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>max_header_size</dt>
  <dd>Defaults to 100_000. Maximum number of bytes to read while parsing
      headers.</dd>
  <dt>server_revision</dt>
  <dd>Defaults to Net::Server::HTTP/$Net::Server::VERSION.</dd>
  <dt>timeout_header</dt>
  <dd>Defaults to 15 - number of seconds to wait for parsing headers.</dd>
  <dt>timeout_idle</dt>
  <dd>Defaults to 60 - number of seconds a request can be idle before the
      request is closed.</dd>
  <dt>access_log_file</dt>
  <dd>Defaults to undef. If true, this represents the location of where the
      access log should be written to. If a special value of STDERR is passed,
      the access log entry will be writing to the same location as the ERROR
      log.</dd>
  <dt>access_log_format</dt>
  <dd>Should be a valid apache log format that will be passed to
      http_log_format. See the http_log_format method for more information.
    <p class="Pp">The default value is the NCSA extended/combined log
      format:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>

    '%h %l %u %t \&quot;%r\&quot; %&gt;s %b \&quot;%{Referer}i\&quot; \&quot;%{User-Agent}i\&quot;'
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>app</dt>
  <dd>Takes one or more items and registers them for dispatch. Arguments may be
      supplied as an arrayref containing a location/target pairs, a hashref
      containing a location/target pairs, a bare code ref that will use
      &quot;/&quot; as the location and the codref as the target, a string with
      a space indicating &quot;location target&quot;, a string containing
      &quot;location=target&quot;, or finally a string that will be used as both
      location and target. For items passed as an arrayref or hashref, the
      target may be a coderef which will be called and should handle the
      request. In all other cases the target should be a valid executable
      suitable for passing to exec_cgi.
    <p class="Pp">The locations will be added in the order that they are
        configured. They will be added to a regular expression which will be
        applied to the incoming PATH_INFO string. If the match is successful,
        the <span class="Li">$ENV</span>{'SCRIPT_NAME'} will be set to the
        matched portion and the matched portion will be removed from
        <span class="Li">$ENV</span>{'PATH_INFO'}.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Once an app has been passed, it is necessary for the server to
        listen on /. Therefore if &quot;/&quot; has not been specifically
        configured for dispatch, the first found dispatch target will also be
        used to handle &quot;/&quot;.</p>
    <p class="Pp">For convenience, if the log_level is 2 or greater, the
        dispatch table is output to the log.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This mechanism is left as a generic mechanism suitable for
        overriding by servers meant to handle more complex dispatch. At the
        moment there is no handling of virtual hosts. At some point we will add
        in the default ability to play static content and likely for the ability
        to configure virtual hosts - or that may have to wait for a third party
        module.</p>
