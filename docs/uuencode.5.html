<p class="Pp">Files output by <a class="Xr">uuencode(1)</a> consist of a header
    line, followed by a number of body lines, and a trailer line. The
    <a class="Xr">uudecode(1)</a> command will ignore any lines preceding the
    header or following the trailer. Lines preceding a header must not, of
    course, look like a header.</p>
<p class="Pp" id="begin">The header line is distinguished by having the first 6
    characters &#x201C;begin&#x00A0;&#x201D; (note the trailing space). The word
    <a class="permalink" href="#begin"><i class="Em">begin</i></a> is followed
    by a mode (in octal), and a string which names the remote file. A space
    separates the three items in the header line.</p>
<p class="Pp">The body consists of a number of lines, each at most 62 characters
    long (including the trailing newline). These consist of a character count,
    followed by encoded characters, followed by a newline. The character count
    is a single printing character, and represents an integer, the number of
    bytes the rest of the line represents. Such integers are always in the range
    from 1 to 45 or 64 and can be determined by subtracting the character space
    (octal 40) from the character. Character 64 represents a count of zero.</p>
<p class="Pp">Groups of 3 bytes are stored in 4 characters, 6 bits per
    character. All characters are always in range from 1 to 64 and are offset by
    a space (octal 40) to make the characters printing. Character 64 represents
    a count of zero. The last line may be shorter than the normal 45 bytes. If
    the size is not a multiple of 3, this fact can be determined by the value of
    the count on the last line. Extra null characters will be included to make
    the character count a multiple of 4. The body is terminated by a line with a
    count of zero. This line consists of one ASCII backquote (octal 140)
    character.</p>
<p class="Pp">The trailer line consists of &#x201C;end&#x201D; on a line by
    itself.</p>
