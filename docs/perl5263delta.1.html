   Set up some character translations and predefined strings.  \*(-- will
   give an unbreakable dash, \*(PI will give pi, \*(L" will give a left
   double quote, and \*(R" will give a right double quote.  \*(C+ will
   give a nicer C++.  Capital omega is used to do unbreakable dashes and
   therefore won't be available.  \*(C` and \*(C' expand to `' in nroff,
   nothing in troff, for use with C<>.

This document describes differences between the 5.26.2 release and the 5.26.3
  release.
<p class="Pp">If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.26.1, first
    read perl5262delta, which describes differences between 5.26.1 and
  5.26.2.</p>

  Directory traversal in module Archive::Tar</a></h2>
By default, Archive::Tar doesn't allow extracting files outside the current
  working directory. However, this secure extraction mode could be bypassed by
  putting a symlink and a regular file with the same name into the tar file.

Integer arithmetic in <span class="Li">&quot;Perl_my_setenv()&quot;</span> could
  wrap when the combined length of the environment variable name and value
  exceeded around 0x7fffffff. This could lead to writing beyond the end of an
  allocated buffer with attacker supplied data.

Perl 5.26.3 represents approximately 8 months of development since Perl 5.26.2
  and contains approximately 4,500 lines of changes across 51 files from 15
  authors.
<p class="Pp">Excluding auto-generated files, documentation and release tools,
    there were approximately 770 lines of changes to 10 .pm, .t, .c and .h
    files.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl continues to flourish into its third decade thanks to a
    vibrant community of users and developers. The following people are known to
    have contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.26.3:</p>
<p class="Pp">Aaron Crane, Abigail, Chris 'BinGOs' Williams, Dagfinn Ilmari
    Mannsaaker, David Mitchell, H.Merijn Brand, James E Keenan, John SJ
    Anderson, Karen Etheridge, Karl Williamson, Sawyer X, Steve Hay, Todd
    Rinaldo, Tony Cook, Yves Orton.</p>
<p class="Pp">The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is
    automatically generated from version control history. In particular, it does
    not include the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who
    reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.</p>
<p class="Pp">Many of the changes included in this version originated in the
    CPAN modules included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire CPAN
    community for helping Perl to flourish.</p>
