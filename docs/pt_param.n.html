   The definitions below are for supplemental macros used in Tcl/Tk
   manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget.  The
  	options follow on successive lines, in four columns separated
  	by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.

<p class="Pp">Welcome to the PackRat Machine (short: <i>PARAM</i>), a virtual
    machine geared towards the support of recursive descent parsers, especially
    packrat parsers. Towards this end it has features like the caching and reuse
    of partial results, the caching of the encountered input, and the ability to
    backtrack in both input and AST creation.</p>

    state and instruction set.</p>

      holding the values to use for CL, ST, SV, and ER after the nonterminal N
      was parsed starting from the location L. It is a performance aid for
      backtracking parsers, allowing them to avoid an expensive reparsing of
      complex nonterminal symbols if they have been encountered before at a
      given location.
    <p class="Pp">The key location is where machine started the attempt to match
        the named nonterminal symbol, and the location in the saved 4-tuple is
        where machine ended up after the attempt completed, independent of the
        success of the attempt.</p>

  <dd>A cache of characters read from IN, with their location in IN as pair of
      line and column, keyed by the location in IN, this time as character
      offset from the beginning of IN. It is a performance aid for backtracking
      parsers, allowing them to avoid a possibly expensive rereading of
      characters from IN, or even enabling backtracking at, i.e. in the case of
      IN not randomly seekable.

    <i>msg</i></a></dt>
  <dd>This method reads the next character, i.e. the character after CL, from
      IN. If successful this character becomes CC, CL is advanced by one, ES is
      cleared, and the operation is recorded as a success in ST.
    <p class="Pp">The operation may read the character from IN if the next
        character is not yet known to TC. If successful the new character is
        stored in TC, with its location (line, column), and the operation
        otherwise behaves as specified above. Future reads from the same
        location, possible due to backtracking, will then be satisfied from TC
        instead of IN.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If, on the other hand, the end of IN was reached, the
