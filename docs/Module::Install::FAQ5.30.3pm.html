Module::Install::FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions for Module::Install
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
Though Module::Install itself has a general FAQ section in the pod, it's more
  for advocacy. Here's an incomplete and growing list of the actual questions I
  have been frequently asked (or found on the net) about Module::Install.
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Do_I_also_have_to_update_my__s-1CPAN_s0_modules_every_time_Module::Install_is_updated?"><a class="permalink" href="#Do_I_also_have_to_update_my__s-1CPAN_s0_modules_every_time_Module::Install_is_updated?">Do
  I also have to update my CPAN modules every time Module::Install is
  updated?</a></h2>
The point of Module::Install is let module authors take care of everything
  related to updating toolchains for the sake of module users. So, if you choose
  to use Module::Install, it's you who should update toolchains, i.e.
  Module::Install and other bundled modules. You should check if there's any
  significant change/fix in your toolchains. You should check if your toolchains
  go along with other tools users use to install your distributions, or with the
  systems users are in, or whatever that matters. In the end, you are expected
  to have much more knowledge and willingness than average users.
<p class="Pp">That being said, practically, you don't have to update your
    distributions if they are working well. But if you do find issues, please
    update your distributions, even when you have nothing to change in your own
    modules. Module::Install is not only a tool to write better, but also a tool
    to encourage you to help others.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Do_I_really_have_to_avoid__fBauto_install()_fP?"><a class="permalink" href="#Do_I_really_have_to_avoid__fBauto_install()_fP?">Do
  I really have to avoid <b>auto_install()</b>?</a></h2>
Not at all, <b>using </b><b>&quot;auto_install()&quot;</b><b> is just fine</b>.
  While it indeed behaved erratically in older Module::Install versions, there
  have been no reported issues since mid-2009. As far as compatibility with
  various CPAN clients: several rather large projects on CPAN (including
  Catalyst and DBIx::Class), are using
  <span class="Li">&quot;auto_install&quot;</span> without any issues reported
  by their substantial userbases.
<p class="Pp">That said, if all you want to do is make it easy for a contributor
    to checkout your code and quickly install necessary dependencies, there are
    alternatives to <span class="Li">&quot;auto_install&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">If your CPAN module is new enough, you can pass a dot to the
    <b>cpan</b> command it provides, and it will install all the required
    distributions from the CPAN:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  $ cpan .
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The same is true for the <b>cpanm</b> command from App::cpanminus,
    with which you even can write like <span class="Li">&quot;cpanm
    --installdeps .&quot;</span></p>

  I put an &quot;inc&quot; directory Module::Install automatically creates into
  a repository for my projects?</a></h2>
Depends. If the repository is private and only for you, you usually don't want
  to put it in your repository to let you always use the latest Module::Install
  you have (the <span class="Li">&quot;inc&quot;</span> directory is recreated
  each time you run <span class="Li">&quot;perl Makefile.PL&quot;</span>).
<p class="Pp">If not, but you alone are the release manager and know what you
    have to do when you release, putting the
    <span class="Li">&quot;inc&quot;</span> directory into your repository may
    help other casual contributors, especially if you use minor (or private)
    non-core extensions in your Makefile.PL.</p>
<p class="Pp">However, if you generously allow other people to release, or
    you're not so familiar with how Module::Install works and don't know what
    you have to do in the above situation, <b>don't</b> put it in the
    repository. It may be the cause of troubles including a wrong version in the
    <span class="Li">&quot;META.yml&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you feel sorry about the inconvenience for your fellow
    contributors, you may want to add explicitly
    <span class="Li">&quot;use</span>
    <span class="Li">Module::Install::&lt;ExtensionYouWantToUse&gt;;&quot;</span>
    after <span class="Li">&quot;use</span>
    <span class="Li">inc::Module::Install;&quot;</span> in your Makefile.PL. It
    doesn't do any harm, and it makes clear which extensions they need to
    install.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="What're_there_in_the__inc__directory?"><a class="permalink" href="#What're_there_in_the__inc__directory?">What're
  there in the &quot;inc&quot; directory?</a></h2>
Module::Install puts its components (sometimes with extra modules) under the
  <span class="Li">&quot;inc&quot;</span> directory to be released with a
  distribution. Those modules will not be installed into your system, unless
  explicitly copied into somewhere. They are only used to help configuration,
  tests, and/or installation.
<p class="Pp">If there's no <span class="Li">&quot;inc&quot;</span> directory,
    Module::Install will automatically create it when you run
    <span class="Li">&quot;perl Makefile.PL&quot;</span>. And if that happens, a
    directory (as of this writing, <span class="Li">&quot;.author&quot;</span>)
    will also be created under the <span class="Li">&quot;inc&quot;</span>
    directory. If the <span class="Li">&quot;.author&quot;</span> directory
    exists, the <span class="Li">&quot;inc&quot;</span> directory will be
    recreated each time you run <span class="Li">&quot;perl</span>
    <span class="Li">Makefile.PL&quot;</span> to make sure everything you need
    is included and up-to-date. This <span class="Li">&quot;.author&quot;</span>
    directory will not be included in a distribution.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="_perl_Makefile.PL__doesn't_work_or_does_a_strange_behavior_for_me._Why?"><a class="permalink" href="#_perl_Makefile.PL__doesn't_work_or_does_a_strange_behavior_for_me._Why?">&quot;perl
  Makefile.PL&quot; doesn't work or does a strange behavior for me.
  Why?</a></h2>
Module::Install uses an Autoloader magic to delegate command handling to the
  extensions in the <span class="Li">&quot;inc&quot;</span> directory. This
  works while everything is in order, but when it finds something it can't
  understands, it dies with a compile error, or does what you don't expect.
<p class="Pp">To prevent the latter strange behavior, Module::Install 0.96 and
    above dies when it tries to process unknown commands. In most cases (other
    than typos), these unknown commands are from non-core extensions on the
    CPAN, and they should hopefully have predictable names that you can easily
    tell from which extension they come, though some may be a bit hard to
  find.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you are trying to contribute to some project, and having a
    trouble to run <span class="Li">&quot;Makefile.PL&quot;</span>, please
    contact the author of the project to learn what you have to install. If the
    distribution is already on the CPAN, you may also want to look into the
    MANIFEST file to see which extensions are included in the
    <span class="Li">&quot;inc&quot;</span> directory before you ask.</p>
<p class="Pp">This usually does not happen in the user land as distributions
    that use Module::Install should have all the necessary extensions under the
    <span class="Li">&quot;inc&quot;</span> directory. If this should happen,
    that's most probably because the release manager shipped the distribution
    under a non-author mode. Please contact the author to fix the issue.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Why_can't_I_do__anything__with_Module::Install_that_I_can_do_with_ExtUtils::MakeMaker?"><a class="permalink" href="#Why_can't_I_do__anything__with_Module::Install_that_I_can_do_with_ExtUtils::MakeMaker?">Why
  can't I do &lt;anything&gt; with Module::Install that I can do with
  ExtUtils::MakeMaker?</a></h2>
Module::Install is just a wrapper of ExtUtils::MakeMaker. You can do almost
  everything you can do with ExtUtils::MakeMaker by passing arbitrary attributes
  to ExtUtils::MakeMaker in the backend via
  <span class="Li">&quot;makemaker_args&quot;</span> like this:
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  use inc::Module::Install;
  
  all_from 'lib/Foo/Bar.pm';
  
  makemaker_args(
    dist =&gt; { PREOP =&gt; '...' },
    PL_FILES =&gt; {'bin/foobar.PL' =&gt; 'bin/foobar'},
  );
  WriteAll;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">However, by the singleton nature of Module::Install, it may fail
    to process Makefile.PLs in subdirectories correctly now, and you may need to
    override attributes explicitly in some cases where Module::Install provides
    other default values than ExtUtils::MakeMaker does. Please see also the
    ExtUtils::MakeMaker's pod for further instructions.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="I_added_MyMakefile.PL_to_my_distribution,_but_it_doesn't_work_as_I_expected._Why?"><a class="permalink" href="#I_added_MyMakefile.PL_to_my_distribution,_but_it_doesn't_work_as_I_expected._Why?">I
  added MyMakefile.PL to my distribution, but it doesn't work as I expected.
  Why?</a></h2>
ExtUtils::MakeMaker (and Module::Build also) treats
  <span class="Li">&quot;*.PL&quot;</span> files in the top level directory as
  something special to generate other files. So, if you add something that has
  <span class="Li">&quot;.PL&quot;</span> extension like
  <span class="Li">&quot;MyMakefile.PL&quot;</span> in the top level directory,
  it also runs automatically when you run Makefile.PL.
<p class="Pp">If you don't like this behavior, use
    <span class="Li">&quot;makemaker_args&quot;</span> to pass an anonymous hash
    to <span class="Li">&quot;PL_FILES&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  makemaker_args(PL_FILES =&gt; {});
