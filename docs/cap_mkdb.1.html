<code class="Nm">Cap_mkdb</code> builds a hashed database out of the
  <a class="Xr">getcap(3)</a> logical database constructed by the concatenation
  of the specified files .
<p class="Pp">The database is named by the basename of the first file argument
    and the string &#x201C;.db&#x201D;. The <a class="Xr">getcap(3)</a> routines
    can access the database in this form much more quickly than they can the
    original text file(s).</p>
<p class="Pp">The ``tc'' capabilities of the records are expanded before the
    record is stored into the database.</p>
<p class="Pp">The options as as follows:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><a class="permalink" href="#f"><code class="Fl" id="f">-f</code></a>
    <var class="Ar">outfile</var></dt>
  <dd>Specify a different database basename.</dd>
  <dt><a class="permalink" href="#v"><code class="Fl" id="v">-v</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Print out the number of capability records in the database.</dd>
</dl>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="FORMAT"><a class="permalink" href="#FORMAT">FORMAT</a></h1>
Each record is stored in the database using two different types of keys.
<p class="Pp">The first type is a key which consists of the first capability of
    the record (not including the trailing colon (``:'')) with a data field
    consisting of a special byte followed by the rest of the record. The special
    byte is either a 0 or 1, where a 0 means that the record is okay, and a 1
    means that there was a ``tc'' capability in the record that couldn't be
    expanded.</p>
<p class="Pp">The second type is a key which consists of one of the names from
    the first capability of the record with a data field consisting a special
    byte followed by the the first capability of the record. The special byte is
    a 2.</p>
<p class="Pp">In normal operation names are looked up in the database, resulting
    in a key/data pair of the second type. The data field of this key/data pair
    is used to look up a key/data pair of the first type which has the real data
    associated with the name.</p>
