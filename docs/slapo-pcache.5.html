The <b>pcache</b> overlay to <b>slapd</b>(8) allows caching of LDAP search
  requests (queries) in a local database. For an incoming query, the proxy cache
  determines its corresponding <b>template</b>. If the template was specified as
  cacheable using the <b>pcacheTemplate</b> directive and the request is
  contained in a cached request, it is answered from the proxy cache. Otherwise,
  the search is performed as usual and cacheable search results are saved in the
  cache for use in future queries.
<p class="Pp">A template is defined by a filter string and an index identifying
    a set of attributes. The <b>template string</b> for a query can be obtained
    by removing assertion values from the RFC 4515 representation of its search
    filter. A query belongs to a template if its template string and set of
    projected attributes correspond to a cacheable template. Examples of
    template strings are <b>(mail=)</b>, <b>(|(sn=)(cn=))</b>,
    <b>(&amp;(sn=)(givenName=))</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">The config directives that are specific to the <b>pcache</b>
    overlay can be prefixed by <b>pcache-</b>, to avoid conflicts with
    directives specific to the underlying database or to other stacked overlays.
    This may be particularly useful for those directives that refer to the
    backend used for local storage. The following cache specific directives can
    be used to configure the proxy cache:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>overlay pcache</b></dt>
  <dd>This directive adds the proxy cache overlay to the current backend. The
      proxy cache overlay may be used with any backend but is intended for use
      with the <b>ldap</b>, <b>meta</b>, and <b>sql</b> backends. Please note
      that the underlying backend must have a configured <b>rootdn.</b></dd>
  <dt><b>pcache &lt;database&gt; &lt;max_entries&gt; &lt;numattrsets&gt;
    &lt;entry_limit&gt; &lt;cc_period&gt;</b></dt>
  <dd>The directive enables proxy caching in the current backend and sets
      general cache parameters. A &lt;database&gt; backend will be used
      internally to maintain the cached entries. The chosen database will need
      to be configured as well, as shown below. Cache replacement is invoked
      when the cache size grows to &lt;max_entries&gt; entries and continues
      till the cache size drops below this size. &lt;numattrsets&gt; should be
      equal to the number of following <b>pcacheAttrset</b> directives. Queries
      are cached only if they correspond to a cacheable template (specified by
      the <b>pcacheTemplate</b> directive) and the number of entries returned is
      less than &lt;entry_limit&gt;. Consistency check is performed every
      &lt;cc_period&gt; duration (specified in secs). In each cycle queries with
      expired &quot;time to live(<b>TTL</b>)&quot; are removed. A sample cache
      configuration is:</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">pcache <b>bdb 10000 1 50 100</b></div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>pcacheAttrset &lt;index&gt; &lt;attrs...&gt;</b></dt>
  <dd>Used to associate a set of attributes &lt;attrs..&gt; with an
      &lt;index&gt;. Each attribute set is associated with an integer from 0 to
      &lt;numattrsets&gt;-1. These indices are used by the <b>pcacheTemplate</b>
      directive to define cacheable templates. A set of attributes cannot be
      empty. A set of attributes can contain the special attributes
      &quot;*&quot; (all user attributes), &quot;+&quot; (all operational
      attributes) or both; in the latter case, any other attribute is redundant
      and should be avoided for clarity. A set of attributes can contain
      &quot;1.1&quot; as the only attribute; in this case, only the presence of
      the entries is cached. Attributes prefixed by &quot;undef:&quot; need not
      be present in the schema.
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>pcacheMaxQueries &lt;queries&gt;</b></dt>
  <dd>Specify the maximum number of queries to cache. The default is 10000.
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>pcacheValidate { TRUE | FALSE }</b></dt>
  <dd>Check whether the results of a query being cached can actually be returned
      from the cache by the proxy DSA. When enabled, the entries being returned
      while caching the results of a query are checked to ensure consistency
      with the schema known to the proxy DSA. In case of failure, the query is
      not cached. By default, the check is off.
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>pcacheOffline { TRUE | FALSE }</b></dt>
  <dd>Set the cache to offline mode. While offline, the consistency checker will
      be stopped and no expirations will occur. This allows the cache contents
      to be used indefinitely while the proxy is cut off from network access to
      the remote DSA. The default is FALSE, i.e. consistency checks and
      expirations will be performed.
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>pcachePersist { TRUE | FALSE }</b></dt>
  <dd>Specify whether the cached queries should be saved across restarts of the
      caching proxy, to provide hot startup of the cache. Only non-expired
      queries are reloaded. The default is FALSE.
    <p class="Pp"><b>CAVEAT</b>: of course, the configuration of the proxy cache
        must not change across restarts; the pcache overlay does not perform any
        consistency checks in this sense. In detail, this option should be
        disabled unless the existing <b>pcacheAttrset</b> and
        <b>pcacheTemplate</b> directives are not changed neither in order nor in
        contents. If new sets and templates are added, or if other details of
        the pcache overlay configuration changed, this feature should not be
        affected.</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>pcacheTemplate &lt;template_string&gt; &lt;attrset_index&gt;
    &lt;ttl&gt; [&lt;negttl&gt; [&lt;limitttl&gt; [&lt;ttr&gt;]]]</b></dt>
  <dd>Specifies a cacheable template and &quot;time to live&quot; &lt;ttl&gt; of
      queries belonging to the template. An optional &lt;negttl&gt; can be used
      to specify that negative results (i.e., queries that returned zero
      entries) should also be cached for the specified amount of time. Negative
      results are not cached by default (&lt;negttl&gt; set to 0). An optional
      &lt;limitttl&gt; can be used to specify that results hitting a sizelimit
      should also be cached for the specified amount of time. Results hitting a
      sizelimit are not cached by default (&lt;limitttl&gt; set to 0). An
      optional &lt;ttr&gt; &quot;time to refresh&quot; can be used to specify
      that cached entries should be automatically refreshed after a certain
      time. Entries will only be refreshed while they have not expired, so the
      &lt;ttl&gt; should be larger than the &lt;ttr&gt; for this option to be
      useful. Entries are not refreshed by default (&lt;ttr&gt; set to 0).
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>pcacheBind &lt;filter_template&gt; &lt;attrset_index&gt; &lt;ttr&gt;
    &lt;scope&gt; &lt;base&gt;</b></dt>
  <dd>Specifies a template for caching Simple Bind credentials based on an
      already defined <b>pcacheTemplate</b>. The &lt;filter_template&gt; is
      similar to a &lt;template_string&gt; except that it may have some values
      present. Its purpose is to allow the overlay to generate filters similar
      to what other applications do when they do a Search immediately before a
      Bind. E.g., if a client like nss_ldap is configured to search for a user
      with the filter
      &quot;(&amp;(objectClass=posixAccount)(uid=&lt;username&gt;))&quot; then
      the corresponding template
      &quot;(&amp;(objectClass=posixAccount)(uid=))&quot; should be used here.
      When converted to a regular template e.g.
      &quot;(&amp;(objectClass=)(uid=))&quot; this template and the
      &lt;attrset_index&gt; must match an already defined <b>pcacheTemplate</b>
      clause. The &quot;time to refresh&quot; &lt;ttr&gt; determines the time
      interval after which the cached credentials may be refreshed. The first
      Bind request that occurs after that time will trigger the refresh attempt.
      Refreshes are not performed when the overlay is Offline. There is no
      &quot;time to live&quot; parameter for the Bind credentials; the
      credentials will expire according to the <b>pcacheTemplate</b> ttl. The
      &lt;scope&gt; and &lt;base&gt; should match the search scope and base used
      by the authentication clients. The cached credentials are not stored in
      cleartext, they are hashed using the default password hash. By default
      Bind caching is not enabled.
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>pcachePosition { head | tail }</b></dt>
  <dd>Specifies whether the response callback should be placed at the
      <b>tail</b> (the default) or at the <b>head</b> (actually, wherever the
      stacking sequence would make it appear) of the callback list. This affects
      how the overlay interacts with other overlays, since the proxycache
      overlay should be executed as early as possible (and thus configured as
      late as possible), to get a chance to return the cached results; however,
      if executed early at response, it would cache entries that may be later
      &quot;massaged&quot; by other databases and thus returned <i>after</i>
      massaging the first time, and <i>before</i> massaging when cached.
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </dd>
  <dt>There are some constraints:</dt>
  <dd>
    <p class="Pp">all values must be positive;</p>
    <p class="Pp"><b>&lt;entry_limit&gt;</b> must be less than or equal to
        <b>&lt;max_entries&gt;</b>;</p>
    <p class="Pp"><b>&lt;numattrsets&gt;</b> attribute sets SHOULD be defined by
        using the directive <b>pcacheAttrset</b>;</p>
    <p class="Pp">all attribute sets SHOULD be referenced by (at least) one
        <b>pcacheTemplate</b> directive;</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The following adds a template with filter string

Caching data is prone to inconsistencies because updates on the remote server
  will not be reflected in the response of the cache at least (and at most) for
  the duration of the <b>pcacheTemplate</b> <b>TTL</b>. These inconsistencies
  can be minimized by careful use of the TTR.
<p class="Pp">The remote server should expose the <b>objectClass</b> attribute
    because the underlying database that actually caches the entries may need it
    for optimal local processing of the queries.</p>
<p class="Pp">The proxy server should contain all the schema information
    required for caching. Significantly, it needs the schema of attributes used
    in the query templates. If the objectClass attribute is used in a query
    template, it needs the definition of the objectClasses of the entries it is
    supposed to cache. It is the responsibility of the proxy administrator to
    keep the proxy schema lined up with that of the proxied server.</p>
<p class="Pp">Another potential (and subtle) inconsistency may occur when data
    is retrieved with different identities and specific per-identity access
    control is enforced by the remote server. If data was retrieved with an
    identity that collected only partial results because of access rules
    enforcement on the remote server, other users with different access
    privileges on the remote server will get different results from the remote
    server and from the cache. If those users have higher access privileges on
    the remote server, they will get from the cache only a subset of the results
    they would get directly from the remote server; but if they have lower
    access privileges, they will get from the cache a superset of the results
    they would get directly from the remote server. Either occurrence may or may
    not be acceptable, based on the security policy of the cache and of the
    remote server. It is important to note that in this case the proxy is
    violating the security of the remote server by disclosing to an identity
    data that was collected by another identity. For this reason, it is
    suggested that, when using <b>back-ldap</b>, proxy caching be used in
    conjunction with the <i>identity assertion</i> feature of
    <b>slapd-ldap</b>(5) (see the <b>idassert-bind</b> and the
    <b>idassert-authz</b> statements), so that remote server interrogation
    occurs with a vanilla identity that has some relatively high <b>search</b>
    and <b>read</b> access privileges, and the &quot;real&quot; access control
    is delegated to the proxy's ACLs. Beware that since only the cached fraction
    of the real datum is available to the cache, it may not be possible to
    enforce the same access rules that are defined on the remote server. When
    security is a concern, cached proxy access must be carefully tailored.</p>
