It is usually impossible to add new syntax to Perl without breaking some
  existing programs. This pragma provides a way to minimize that risk. New
  syntactic constructs, or new semantic meanings to older constructs, can be
  enabled by <span class="Li">&quot;use feature 'foo'&quot;</span>, and will be
  parsed only when the appropriate feature pragma is in scope. (Nevertheless,
  the <span class="Li">&quot;CORE::&quot;</span> prefix provides access to all
  Perl keywords, regardless of this pragma.)
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Lexical_effect"><a class="permalink" href="#Lexical_effect">Lexical
  effect</a></h2>
Like other pragmas (<span class="Li">&quot;use strict&quot;</span>, for
  example), features have a lexical effect. <span class="Li">&quot;use feature
  qw(foo)&quot;</span> will only make the feature &quot;foo&quot; available from
  that point to the end of the enclosing block.
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    {
        use feature 'say';
        say &quot;say is available here&quot;;

</pre>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="_no_feature_"><a class="permalink" href="#_no_feature_">&quot;no

Features can also be turned off by using <span class="Li">&quot;no feature
  &quot;foo&quot;&quot;</span>. This too has lexical effect.
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    use feature 'say';

    {

<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;no feature&quot;</span> with no features

  'unicode_strings' feature</a></h2>
<span class="Li">&quot;use feature 'unicode_strings'&quot;</span> tells the
  compiler to use Unicode rules in all string operations executed within its
  scope (unless they are also within the scope of either
  <span class="Li">&quot;use locale&quot;</span> or <span class="Li">&quot;use
  bytes&quot;</span>). The same applies to all regular expressions compiled
  within the scope, even if executed outside it. It does not change the internal
  representation of strings, but only how they are interpreted.
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;no feature 'unicode_strings'&quot;</span>
    tells the compiler to use the traditional Perl rules wherein the native
    character set rules is used unless it is clear to Perl that Unicode is
    desired. This can lead to some surprises when the behavior suddenly changes.
    (See &quot;The &quot;Unicode Bug&quot;&quot; in perlunicode for details.)
    For this reason, if you are potentially using Unicode in your program, the
    <span class="Li">&quot;use feature 'unicode_strings'&quot;</span> subpragma
    is <b>strongly</b> recommended.</p>
<p class="Pp">This feature is available starting with Perl 5.12; was almost

<h2 class="Ss" id="The_'unicode_eval'_and_'evalbytes'_features"><a class="permalink" href="#The_'unicode_eval'_and_'evalbytes'_features">The
  'unicode_eval' and 'evalbytes' features</a></h2>
Together, these two features are intended to replace the legacy string
  <span class="Li">&quot;eval&quot;</span> function, which behaves
  problematically in some instances. They are available starting with Perl 5.16,
  and are enabled by default by a
  <span class="Li">&quot;use&#x00A0;5.16&quot;</span> or higher declaration.
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;unicode_eval&quot;</span> changes the
    behavior of plain string <span class="Li">&quot;eval&quot;</span> to work
    more consistently, especially in the Unicode world. Certain (mis)behaviors
    couldn't be changed without breaking some things that had come to rely on
    them, so the feature can be enabled and disabled. Details are at &quot;Under
    the &quot;unicode_eval&quot; feature&quot; in perlfunc.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;evalbytes&quot;</span> is like string
    <span class="Li">&quot;eval&quot;</span>, but operating on a byte stream
    that is not UTF-8 encoded. Details are at &quot;evalbytes EXPR&quot; in
    perlfunc. Without a
    <span class="Li">&quot;use&#x00A0;feature&#x00A0;'evalbytes'&quot;</span>
    nor a <span class="Li">&quot;use&#x00A0;v5.16&quot;</span> (or higher)

In Perl versions prior to 5.26, this feature enabled declaration of subroutines
  via <span class="Li">&quot;my sub foo&quot;</span>,
  <span class="Li">&quot;state sub foo&quot;</span> and
  <span class="Li">&quot;our sub foo&quot;</span> syntax. See &quot;Lexical

<p class="Pp">This feature is available from Perl 5.18 onwards. From Perl 5.18

<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  no warnings &quot;experimental::lexical_subs&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">As of Perl 5.26, use of this feature no longer triggers a warning,
    though the <span class="Li">&quot;experimental::lexical_subs&quot;</span>

The 'postderef_qq' feature extends the applicability of postfix dereference
  syntax so that postfix array and scalar dereference are available in
  double-quotish interpolations. For example, it makes the following two
  statements equivalent:
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  my $s = &quot;[@{ $h-&gt;{a} }]&quot;;
  my $s = &quot;[$h-&gt;{a}-&gt;@*]&quot;;

<p class="Pp">The 'postderef' feature was used in Perl 5.20 and Perl 5.22 to

    same way as the 'postderef_qq' feature did. As of Perl 5.24, this syntax is

<h1 class="Sh" id="IMPLICIT_LOADING"><a class="permalink" href="#IMPLICIT_LOADING">IMPLICIT
  LOADING</a></h1>
Instead of loading feature bundles by name, it is easier to let Perl do implicit
  loading of a feature bundle for you.
<p class="Pp">There are two ways to load the
    <span class="Li">&quot;feature&quot;</span> pragma implicitly:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>By using the <span class="Li">&quot;-E&quot;</span> switch on the Perl
      command-line instead of <span class="Li">&quot;-e&quot;</span>. That will
      enable the feature bundle for that version of Perl in the main compilation
      unit (that is, the one-liner that follows
      <span class="Li">&quot;-E&quot;</span>).</li>
  <li>By explicitly requiring a minimum Perl version number for your program,
      with the <span class="Li">&quot;use VERSION&quot;</span> construct. That
      is,
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    use v5.10.0;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">will do an implicit</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    no feature ':all';
    use feature ':5.10';
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">and so on. Note how the trailing sub-version is automatically
        stripped from the version.</p>
    <p class="Pp">But to avoid portability warnings (see &quot;use&quot; in
        perlfunc), you may prefer:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    use 5.010;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">with the same effect.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If the required version is older than Perl 5.10, the
        &quot;:default&quot; feature bundle is automatically loaded instead.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Unlike <span class="Li">&quot;use feature
        &quot;:5.12&quot;&quot;</span>, saying <span class="Li">&quot;use
        v5.12&quot;</span> (or any higher version) also does the equivalent of
