<p class="Pp">It is usually impossible to add new syntax to Perl without
    breaking some existing programs. This pragma provides a way to minimize that
    risk. New syntactic constructs, or new semantic meanings to older
    constructs, can be enabled by <span class="Li">&quot;use feature
    'foo'&quot;</span>, and will be parsed only when the appropriate feature
    pragma is in scope. (Nevertheless, the

  'unicode_strings' feature</a></h2>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;use feature 'unicode_strings'&quot;</span>
    tells the compiler to use Unicode rules in all string operations executed
    within its scope (unless they are also within the scope of either
    <span class="Li">&quot;use locale&quot;</span> or <span class="Li">&quot;use
    bytes&quot;</span>). The same applies to all regular expressions compiled
    within the scope, even if executed outside it. It does not change the
    internal representation of strings, but only how they are interpreted.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;no feature 'unicode_strings'&quot;</span>
    tells the compiler to use the traditional Perl rules wherein the native
    character set rules is used unless it is clear to Perl that Unicode is
    desired. This can lead to some surprises when the behavior suddenly changes.
    (See &quot;The &quot;Unicode Bug&quot;&quot; in perlunicode for details.)
    For this reason, if you are potentially using Unicode in your program, the
    <span class="Li">&quot;use feature 'unicode_strings'&quot;</span> subpragma
    is <b>strongly</b> recommended.</p>
<p class="Pp">This feature is available starting with Perl 5.12; was almost
    fully implemented in Perl 5.14; and extended in Perl 5.16 to cover
    <span class="Li">&quot;quotemeta&quot;</span>; was extended further in Perl

<p class="Pp">Together, these two features are intended to replace the legacy
    string <span class="Li">&quot;eval&quot;</span> function, which behaves
    problematically in some instances. They are available starting with Perl
    5.16, and are enabled by default by a
    <span class="Li">&quot;use&#x00A0;5.16&quot;</span> or higher
  declaration.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;unicode_eval&quot;</span> changes the
    behavior of plain string <span class="Li">&quot;eval&quot;</span> to work
    more consistently, especially in the Unicode world. Certain (mis)behaviors
    couldn't be changed without breaking some things that had come to rely on
    them, so the feature can be enabled and disabled. Details are at &quot;Under
    the &quot;unicode_eval&quot; feature&quot; in perlfunc.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;evalbytes&quot;</span> is like string
    <span class="Li">&quot;eval&quot;</span>, but operating on a byte stream
    that is not UTF-8 encoded. Details are at &quot;evalbytes EXPR&quot; in

<p class="Pp">This feature is available from Perl 5.18 onwards. From Perl 5.18
    to 5.24, it was classed as experimental, and Perl emitted a warning for its
    usage, except when explicitly disabled:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  no warnings &quot;experimental::lexical_subs&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">As of Perl 5.26, use of this feature no longer triggers a warning,

  'postderef' and 'postderef_qq' features</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The 'postderef_qq' feature extends the applicability of postfix
    dereference syntax so that postfix array and scalar dereference are
    available in double-quotish interpolations. For example, it makes the
    following two statements equivalent:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  my $s = &quot;[@{ $h-&gt;{a} }]&quot;;
  my $s = &quot;[$h-&gt;{a}-&gt;@*]&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This feature is available from Perl 5.20 onwards. In Perl 5.20 and
    5.22, it was classed as experimental, and Perl emitted a warning for its
    usage, except when explicitly disabled:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  no warnings &quot;experimental::postderef&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">As of Perl 5.24, use of this feature no longer triggers a warning,
    though the <span class="Li">&quot;experimental::postderef&quot;</span>
    warning category still exists (for compatibility with code that disables
    it).</p>
<p class="Pp">The 'postderef' feature was used in Perl 5.20 and Perl 5.22 to
    enable postfix dereference syntax outside double-quotish interpolations. In
    those versions, using it triggered the
    <span class="Li">&quot;experimental::postderef&quot;</span> warning in the
    same way as the 'postderef_qq' feature did. As of Perl 5.24, this syntax is
    not only no longer experimental, but it is enabled for all Perl code,

  LOADING</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Instead of loading feature bundles by name, it is easier to let
    Perl do implicit loading of a feature bundle for you.</p>
<p class="Pp">There are two ways to load the
    <span class="Li">&quot;feature&quot;</span> pragma implicitly:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>By using the <span class="Li">&quot;-E&quot;</span> switch on the Perl
      command-line instead of <span class="Li">&quot;-e&quot;</span>. That will
      enable the feature bundle for that version of Perl in the main compilation
      unit (that is, the one-liner that follows
      <span class="Li">&quot;-E&quot;</span>).</li>
  <li>By explicitly requiring a minimum Perl version number for your program,
      with the <span class="Li">&quot;use VERSION&quot;</span> construct. That
      is,
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    use v5.10.0;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">will do an implicit</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    no feature ':all';
    use feature ':5.10';
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">and so on. Note how the trailing sub-version is automatically
        stripped from the version.</p>
    <p class="Pp">But to avoid portability warnings (see &quot;use&quot; in
        perlfunc), you may prefer:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    use 5.010;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">with the same effect.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If the required version is older than Perl 5.10, the
        &quot;:default&quot; feature bundle is automatically loaded instead.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Unlike <span class="Li">&quot;use feature
        &quot;:5.12&quot;&quot;</span>, saying <span class="Li">&quot;use
        v5.12&quot;</span> (or any higher version) also does the equivalent of
        <span class="Li">&quot;use strict&quot;</span>; see &quot;use&quot; in
        perlfunc for details.</p>
