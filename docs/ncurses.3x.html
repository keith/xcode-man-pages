The <b>ncurses</b> library routines give the user a terminal-independent method
  of updating character screens with reasonable optimization. This
  implementation is ``new curses'' (ncurses) and is the approved replacement for
  4.4BSD classic curses, which has been discontinued. This describes
  <b>ncurses</b> version 5.7 (patch 20081102).
<p class="Pp">The <b>ncurses</b> library emulates the <b>curses</b>(3X) library
    of System V Release 4 UNIX, and XPG4 (X/Open Portability Guide) curses (also
    known as XSI curses). XSI stands for X/Open System Interfaces Extension. The
    <b>ncurses</b> library is freely redistributable in source form. Differences
    from the SVr4 curses are summarized under the <b>EXTENSIONS</b> and
    <b>PORTABILITY</b> sections below and described in detail in the respective
    <b>EXTENSIONS</b>, <b>PORTABILITY</b> and <b>BUGS</b> sections of individual
    man pages.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>ncurses</b> library also provides many useful extensions,
    i.e., features which cannot be implemented by a simple add-on library but
    which require access to the internals of the library.</p>
<p class="Pp">A program using these routines must be linked with the
    <b>-lncurses</b> option, or (if it has been generated) with the debugging
    library <b>-lncurses_g</b>. (Your system integrator may also have installed
    these libraries under the names <b>-lcurses</b> and <b>-lcurses_g</b>.) The
    ncurses_g library generates trace logs (in a file called 'trace' in the
    current directory) that describe curses actions. See also the section on
    <b>ALTERNATE CONFIGURATIONS</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>ncurses</b> package supports: overall screen, window and
    pad manipulation; output to windows and pads; reading terminal input;
    control over terminal and <b>curses</b> input and output options;
    environment query routines; color manipulation; use of soft label keys;
    terminfo capabilities; and access to low-level terminal-manipulation
    routines.</p>
<p class="Pp">The library uses the locale which the calling program has
    initialized. That is normally done with <b>setlocale</b>:</p>
<p class="Pp">
   <b>setlocale(LC_ALL, &quot;&quot;);</b></p>
<p class="Pp">If the locale is not initialized, the library assumes that
    characters are printable as in ISO-8859-1, to work with certain legacy
    programs. You should initialize the locale and not rely on specific details
    of the library when the locale has not been setup.</p>
<p class="Pp">The function <b>initscr</b> or <b>newterm</b> must be called to
    initialize the library before any of the other routines that deal with
    windows and screens are used. The routine <b>endwin</b> must be called
    before exiting.</p>
<p class="Pp">To get character-at-a-time input without echoing (most
    interactive, screen oriented programs want this), the following sequence
    should be used:</p>
<p class="Pp">
   <b>initscr(); cbreak(); noecho();</b></p>
<p class="Pp">Most programs would additionally use the sequence:</p>
<p class="Pp">
   <b>nonl();</b>
   <b>intrflush(stdscr, FALSE);</b>
   <b>keypad(stdscr, TRUE);</b></p>
<p class="Pp">Before a <b>curses</b> program is run, the tab stops of the
    terminal should be set and its initialization strings, if defined, must be
    output. This can be done by executing the <b>tput init</b> command after the
    shell environment variable <b>TERM</b> has been exported. <b>tset(1)</b> is
    usually responsible for doing this. [See <b>terminfo</b>(5) for further
    details.]</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>ncurses</b> library permits manipulation of data
    structures, called <i>windows</i>, which can be thought of as
    two-dimensional arrays of characters representing all or part of a CRT
    screen. A default window called <b>stdscr</b>, which is the size of the
    terminal screen, is supplied. Others may be created with <b>newwin</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that <b>curses</b> does not handle overlapping windows,
    that's done by the <b>panel</b>(3X) library. This means that you can either
    use <b>stdscr</b> or divide the screen into tiled windows and not using
    <b>stdscr</b> at all. Mixing the two will result in unpredictable, and
    undesired, effects.</p>
<p class="Pp">Windows are referred to by variables declared as <b>WINDOW *</b>.
    These data structures are manipulated with routines described here and
    elsewhere in the <b>ncurses</b> manual pages. Among those, the most basic
    routines are <b>move</b> and <b>addch</b>. More general versions of these
    routines are included with names beginning with <b>w</b>, allowing the user
    to specify a window. The routines not beginning with <b>w</b> affect
    <b>stdscr</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">After using routines to manipulate a window, <b>refresh</b> is
    called, telling <b>curses</b> to make the user's CRT screen look like
    <b>stdscr</b>. The characters in a window are actually of type
    <b>chtype</b>, (character and attribute data) so that other information
    about the character may also be stored with each character.</p>
<p class="Pp">Special windows called <i>pads</i> may also be manipulated. These
    are windows which are not constrained to the size of the screen and whose
    contents need not be completely displayed. See <b>curs_pad</b>(3X) for more
    information.</p>
<p class="Pp">In addition to drawing characters on the screen, video attributes
    and colors may be supported, causing the characters to show up in such modes
    as underlined, in reverse video, or in color on terminals that support such
    display enhancements. Line drawing characters may be specified to be output.
    On input, <b>curses</b> is also able to translate arrow and function keys
    that transmit escape sequences into single values. The video attributes,
    line drawing characters, and input values use names, defined in
    <b>&lt;curses.h&gt;</b>, such as <b>A_REVERSE</b>, <b>ACS_HLINE</b>, and
    <b>KEY_LEFT</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the environment variables <b>LINES</b> and <b>COLUMNS</b> are
    set, or if the program is executing in a window environment, line and column
    information in the environment will override information read by
    <i>terminfo</i>. This would affect a program running in an AT&amp;T 630
    layer, for example, where the size of a screen is changeable (see
    <b>ENVIRONMENT</b>).</p>
<p class="Pp">If the environment variable <b>TERMINFO</b> is defined, any
    program using <b>curses</b> checks for a local terminal definition before
    checking in the standard place. For example, if <b>TERM</b> is set to
    <b>att4424</b>, then the compiled terminal definition is found in</p>
<p class="Pp">
   <b>/usr/share/terminfo/a/att4424</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">(The <b>a</b> is copied from the first letter of <b>att4424</b> to
    avoid creation of huge directories.) However, if <b>TERMINFO</b> is set to
    <b>$HOME/myterms</b>, <b>curses</b> first checks</p>
<p class="Pp">
   <b>$HOME/myterms/a/att4424</b>,</p>
<p class="Pp">and if that fails, it then checks</p>
<p class="Pp">
   <b>/usr/share/terminfo/a/att4424</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">This is useful for developing experimental definitions or when
    write permission in <b>/usr/share/terminfo</b> is not available.</p>
<p class="Pp">The integer variables <b>LINES</b> and <b>COLS</b> are defined in
    <b>&lt;curses.h&gt;</b> and will be filled in by <b>initscr</b> with the
    size of the screen. The constants <b>TRUE</b> and <b>FALSE</b> have the
    values <b>1</b> and <b>0</b>, respectively.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>curses</b> routines also define the <b>WINDOW *</b>
    variable <b>curscr</b> which is used for certain low-level operations like
    clearing and redrawing a screen containing garbage. The <b>curscr</b> can be
    used in only a few routines.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Routine_and_Argument_Names"><a class="permalink" href="#Routine_and_Argument_Names">Routine
  and Argument Names</a></h2>
Many <b>curses</b> routines have two or more versions. The routines prefixed
  with <b>w</b> require a window argument. The routines prefixed with <b>p</b>
  require a pad argument. Those without a prefix generally use <b>stdscr</b>.
<p class="Pp">The routines prefixed with <b>mv</b> require a <i>y</i> and
    <i>x</i> coordinate to move to before performing the appropriate action. The
    <b>mv</b> routines imply a call to <b>move</b> before the call to the other
    routine. The coordinate <i>y</i> always refers to the row (of the window),
    and <i>x</i> always refers to the column. The upper left-hand corner is
    always (0,0), not (1,1).</p>
<p class="Pp">The routines prefixed with <b>mvw</b> take both a window argument
    and <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> coordinates. The window argument is always
    specified before the coordinates.</p>
<p class="Pp">In each case, <i>win</i> is the window affected, and <i>pad</i> is
    the pad affected; <i>win</i> and <i>pad</i> are always pointers to type
    <b>WINDOW</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Option setting routines require a Boolean flag <i>bf</i> with the
    value <b>TRUE</b> or <b>FALSE</b>; <i>bf</i> is always of type <b>bool</b>.
    Most of the data types used in the library routines, such as <b>WINDOW</b>,
    <b>SCREEN</b>, <b>bool</b>, and <b>chtype</b> are defined in
    <b>&lt;curses.h&gt;</b>. Types used for the terminfo routines such as
    <b>TERMINAL</b> are defined in <b>&lt;term.h&gt;</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">This manual page describes functions which may appear in any
    configuration of the library. There are two common configurations of the
    library:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>ncurses</dt>
  <dd>the &quot;normal&quot; library, which handles 8-bit characters. The normal
      (8-bit) library stores characters combined with attributes in
      <b>chtype</b> data.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Attributes alone (no corresponding character) may be stored in
      <b>chtype</b> or the equivalent <b>attr_t</b> data. In either case, the
      data is stored in something like an integer.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Each cell (row and column) in a <b>WINDOW</b> is stored as a
      <b>chtype</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>ncursesw</dt>
  <dd>the so-called &quot;wide&quot; library, which handles multibyte characters
      (See the section on <b>ALTERNATE CONFIGURATIONS</b>). The &quot;wide&quot;
      library includes all of the calls from the &quot;normal&quot; library. It
      adds about one third more calls using data types which store multibyte
      characters:</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>cchar_t</b></dt>
  <dd>corresponds to <b>chtype</b>. However it is a structure, because more data
      is stored than can fit into an integer. The characters are large enough to
      require a full integer value - and there may be more than one character
      per cell. The video attributes and color are stored in separate fields of
      the structure.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Each cell (row and column) in a <b>WINDOW</b> is stored as a
      <b>cchar_t</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>wchar_t</b></dt>
  <dd>stores a &quot;wide&quot; character. Like <b>chtype</b>, this may be an
      integer.</dd>
  <dt><b>wint_t</b></dt>
  <dd>stores a <b>wchar_t</b> or <b>WEOF</b> - not the same, though both may
      have the same size.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>The &quot;wide&quot; library provides new functions which are analogous to
      functions in the &quot;normal&quot; library. There is a naming convention
      which relates many of the normal/wide variants: a &quot;_w&quot; is
      inserted into the name. For example, <b>waddch</b> becomes
      <b>wadd_wch</b>.</dd>

<h1 class="Sh" id="ENVIRONMENT"><a class="permalink" href="#ENVIRONMENT">ENVIRONMENT</a></h1>
The following environment symbols are useful for customizing the runtime
  behavior of the <b>ncurses</b> library. The most important ones have been
  already discussed in detail.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>BAUDRATE</dt>
  <dd>The debugging library checks this environment symbol when the application
      has redirected output to a file. The symbol's numeric value is used for
      the baudrate. If no value is found, <b>ncurses</b> uses 9600. This allows
      testers to construct repeatable test-cases that take into account costs
      that depend on baudrate.</dd>
  <dt>CC</dt>
  <dd>When set, change occurrences of the command_character (i.e., the
      <b>cmdch</b> capability) of the loaded terminfo entries to the value of
      this symbol. Very few terminfo entries provide this feature.</dd>
  <dt>COLUMNS</dt>
  <dd>Specify the width of the screen in characters. Applications running in a
      windowing environment usually are able to obtain the width of the window
      in which they are executing. If neither the <b>COLUMNS</b> value nor the
      terminal's screen size is available, <b>ncurses</b> uses the size which
      may be specified in the terminfo database (i.e., the <b>cols</b>
      capability).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>It is important that your application use a correct size for the screen.
      This is not always possible because your application may be running on a
      host which does not honor NAWS (Negotiations About Window Size), or
      because you are temporarily running as another user. However, setting
      <b>COLUMNS</b> and/or <b>LINES</b> overrides the library's use of the
      screen size obtained from the operating system.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Either <b>COLUMNS</b> or <b>LINES</b> symbols may be specified
      independently. This is mainly useful to circumvent legacy misfeatures of
      terminal descriptions, e.g., xterm which commonly specifies a 65 line
      screen. For best results, <b>lines</b> and <b>cols</b> should not be
      specified in a terminal description for terminals which are run as
      emulations.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Use the <b>use_env</b> function to disable all use of external environment
      (including system calls) to determine the screen size.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>ESCDELAY</dt>
  <dd>Specifies the total time, in milliseconds, for which ncurses will await a
      character sequence, e.g., a function key. The default value, 1000
      milliseconds, is enough for most uses. However, it is made a variable to
      accommodate unusual applications.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>The most common instance where you may wish to change this value is to
      work with slow hosts, e.g., running on a network. If the host cannot read
      characters rapidly enough, it will have the same effect as if the terminal
      did not send characters rapidly enough. The library will still see a
      timeout.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Note that xterm mouse events are built up from character sequences
      received from the xterm. If your application makes heavy use of
      multiple-clicking, you may wish to lengthen this default value because the
      timeout applies to the composed multi-click event as well as the
      individual clicks.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>In addition to the environment variable, this implementation provides a
      global variable with the same name. Portable applications should not rely
      upon the presence of ESCDELAY in either form, but setting the environment
      variable rather than the global variable does not create problems when
      compiling an application.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>HOME</dt>
  <dd>Tells <b>ncurses</b> where your home directory is. That is where it may
      read and write auxiliary terminal descriptions:</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>$HOME/.termcap
    <br/>
    $HOME/.terminfo</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>LINES</dt>
  <dd>Like COLUMNS, specify the height of the screen in characters. See COLUMNS
      for a detailed description.</dd>
  <dt>MOUSE_BUTTONS_123</dt>
  <dd>This applies only to the OS/2 EMX port. It specifies the order of buttons
      on the mouse. OS/2 numbers a 3-button mouse inconsistently from other
      platforms:
    <p class="Pp">1 = left
      <br/>
      2 = right
      <br/>
      3 = middle.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This symbol lets you customize the mouse. The symbol must be
        three numeric digits 1-3 in any order, e.g., 123 or 321. If it is not
        specified, <b>ncurses</b> uses 132.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>NCURSES_ASSUMED_COLORS</dt>
  <dd>Override the compiled-in assumption that the terminal's default colors are
      white-on-black (see <b>default_colors</b>(3X)). You may set the foreground
      and background color values with this environment variable by proving a
      2-element list: foreground,background. For example, to tell ncurses to not
      assume anything about the colors, set this to &quot;-1,-1&quot;. To make
      it green-on-black, set it to &quot;2,0&quot;. Any positive value from zero
      to the terminfo <b>max_colors</b> value is allowed.</dd>
  <dt>NCURSES_GPM_TERMS</dt>
  <dd>This applies only to ncurses configured to use the GPM interface.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>If present, the environment variable is a list of one or more terminal
      names against which the TERM environment variable is matched. Setting it
      to an empty value disables the GPM interface; using the built-in support
      for xterm, etc.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>If the environment variable is absent, ncurses will attempt to open GPM if
      TERM contains &quot;linux&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>NCURSES_NO_HARD_TABS</dt>
  <dd><b>Ncurses</b> may use tabs as part of the cursor movement optimization.
      In some cases, your terminal driver may not handle these properly. Set
      this environment variable to disable the feature. You can also adjust your
      <b>stty</b> settings to avoid the problem.</dd>
  <dt>NCURSES_NO_MAGIC_COOKIES</dt>
  <dd>Some terminals use a magic-cookie feature which requires special handling
      to make highlighting and other video attributes display properly. You can
      suppress the highlighting entirely for these terminals by setting this
      environment variable.</dd>
  <dt>NCURSES_NO_PADDING</dt>
  <dd>Most of the terminal descriptions in the terminfo database are written for
      real &quot;hardware&quot; terminals. Many people use terminal emulators
      which run in a windowing environment and use curses-based applications.
      Terminal emulators can duplicate all of the important aspects of a
      hardware terminal, but they do not have the same limitations. The chief
      limitation of a hardware terminal from the standpoint of your application
      is the management of dataflow, i.e., timing. Unless a hardware terminal is
      interfaced into a terminal concentrator (which does flow control), it (or
      your application) must manage dataflow, preventing overruns. The cheapest
      solution (no hardware cost) is for your program to do this by pausing
      after operations that the terminal does slowly, such as clearing the
      display.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>As a result, many terminal descriptions (including the vt100) have delay
      times embedded. You may wish to use these descriptions, but not want to
      pay the performance penalty.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Set the NCURSES_NO_PADDING symbol to disable all but mandatory padding.
      Mandatory padding is used as a part of special control sequences such as
      <i>flash</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>NCURSES_NO_SETBUF</dt>
  <dd>Normally <b>ncurses</b> enables buffered output during terminal
      initialization. This is done (as in SVr4 curses) for performance reasons.
      For testing purposes, both of <b>ncurses</b> and certain applications,
      this feature is made optional. Setting the NCURSES_NO_SETBUF variable
      disables output buffering, leaving the output in the original (usually
      line buffered) mode.</dd>
  <dt>NCURSES_NO_UTF8_ACS</dt>
  <dd>During initialization, the <b>ncurses</b> library checks for special cases
      where VT100 line-drawing (and the corresponding alternate character set
      capabilities) described in the terminfo are known to be missing.
      Specifically, when running in a UTF-8 locale, the Linux console emulator
      and the GNU screen program ignore these. Ncurses checks the TERM
      environment variable for these. For other special cases, you should set
      this environment variable. Doing this tells ncurses to use Unicode values
      which correspond to the VT100 line-drawing glyphs. That works for the
      special cases cited, and is likely to work for terminal emulators.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>When setting this variable, you should set it to a nonzero value. Setting
      it to zero (or to a nonnumber) disables the special check for Linux and
      screen.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>NCURSES_TRACE</dt>
  <dd>During initialization, the <b>ncurses</b> debugging library checks the
      NCURSES_TRACE symbol. If it is defined, to a numeric value, <b>ncurses</b>
      calls the <b>trace</b> function, using that value as the argument.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>The argument values, which are defined in <b>curses.h</b>, provide several
      types of information. When running with traces enabled, your application
      will write the file <b>trace</b> to the current directory.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>TERM</dt>
  <dd>Denotes your terminal type. Each terminal type is distinct, though many

  <dt>TERMCAP</dt>
  <dd>If the <b>ncurses</b> library has been configured with <i>termcap</i>

      form if it is not available in the terminfo database.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>The TERMCAP symbol contains either a terminal description (with newlines
      stripped out), or a file name telling where the information denoted by the
      TERM symbol exists. In either case, setting it directs <b>ncurses</b> to
      ignore the usual place for this information, e.g., /etc/termcap.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>TERMINFO</dt>
  <dd>Overrides the directory in which <b>ncurses</b> searches for your terminal

</dl>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>TERMINFO_DIRS</dt>
  <dd>Specifies a list of directories to search for terminal descriptions. The
      list is separated by colons (i.e., &quot;:&quot;) on Unix, semicolons on
      OS/2 EMX. All of the terminal descriptions are in terminfo form, which
      makes a subdirectory named for the first letter of the terminal names
      therein.</dd>
  <dt>TERMPATH</dt>
  <dd>If TERMCAP does not hold a file name then <b>ncurses</b> checks the
      TERMPATH symbol. This is a list of filenames separated by spaces or colons
      (i.e., &quot;:&quot;) on Unix, semicolons on OS/2 EMX. If the TERMPATH
      symbol is not set, <b>ncurses</b> looks in the files /etc/termcap,

</dl>
<p class="Pp">The library may be configured to disregard the following variables
    when the current user is the superuser (root), or if the application uses

Several different configurations are possible, depending on the configure script
  options used when building <b>ncurses</b>. There are a few main options whose
  effects are visible to the applications developer using <b>ncurses</b>:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>--disable-overwrite</dt>
  <dd>The standard include for <b>ncurses</b> is as noted in

  <dd>This option is used to avoid filename conflicts when <b>ncurses</b> is not
      the main implementation of curses of the computer. If <b>ncurses</b> is
      installed disabling overwrite, it puts its headers in a subdirectory,

      to build executables.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>--enable-widec</dt>
  <dd>The configure script renames the library and (if the
      <b>--disable-overwrite</b> option is used) puts the header files in a
      different subdirectory. All of the library names have a &quot;w&quot;

  <dd>You must also define <b>_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED</b> when compiling for the
      wide-character library to use the extended (wide-character) functions. The
      <b>curses.h</b> file which is installed for the wide-character library is
      designed to be compatible with the normal library's header. Only the size
      of the <b>WINDOW</b> structure differs, and very few applications require
      more than a pointer to <b>WINDOW</b>s. If the headers are installed
      allowing overwrite, the wide-character library's headers should be
      installed last, to allow applications to be built using either library

  <dd>The shared and normal (static) library names differ by their suffixes,

The <b>ncurses</b> library can be compiled with an option (<b>-DUSE_GETCAP</b>)
  that falls back to the old-style /etc/termcap file if the terminal setup code
  cannot find a terminfo entry corresponding to <b>TERM</b>. Use of this feature
  is not recommended, as it essentially includes an entire termcap compiler in
  the <b>ncurses</b> startup code, at significant cost in core and startup
  cycles.
<p class="Pp">The <b>ncurses</b> library includes facilities for capturing mouse
    events on certain terminals (including xterm). See the <b>curs_mouse</b>(3X)
    manual page for details.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>ncurses</b> library includes facilities for responding to
    window resizing events, e.g., when running in an xterm. See the
    <b>resizeterm</b>(3X) and <b>wresize</b>(3X) manual pages for details. In
    addition, the library may be configured with a SIGWINCH handler.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>ncurses</b> library extends the fixed set of function key
    capabilities of terminals by allowing the application designer to define
    additional key sequences at runtime. See the <b>define_key</b>(3X)
    <b>key_defined</b>(3X), and <b>keyok</b>(3X) manual pages for details.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>ncurses</b> library can exploit the capabilities of
    terminals which implement the ISO-6429 SGR 39 and SGR 49 controls, which
    allow an application to reset the terminal to its original foreground and
    background colors. From the users' perspective, the application is able to
    draw colored text on a background whose color is set independently,
    providing better control over color contrasts. See the
    <b>default_colors</b>(3X) manual page for details.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>ncurses</b> library includes a function for directing
    application output to a printer attached to the terminal device. See the

The <b>ncurses</b> library is intended to be BASE-level conformant with XSI
  Curses. The EXTENDED XSI Curses functionality (including color support) is
  supported.
<p class="Pp">A small number of local differences (that is, individual
    differences between the XSI Curses and <b>ncurses</b> calls) are described
    in <b>PORTABILITY</b> sections of the library man pages.</p>
<p class="Pp">This implementation also contains several extensions:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">The routine <b>has_key</b> is not part of XPG4, nor is it present
    in SVr4. See the <b>curs_getch</b>(3X) manual page for details.</p>
<p class="Pp">The routine <b>slk_attr</b> is not part of XPG4, nor is it present
    in SVr4. See the <b>curs_slk</b>(3X) manual page for details.</p>
<p class="Pp">The routines <b>getmouse</b>, <b>mousemask</b>, <b>ungetmouse</b>,
    <b>mouseinterval</b>, and <b>wenclose</b> relating to mouse interfacing are
    not part of XPG4, nor are they present in SVr4. See the
    <b>curs_mouse</b>(3X) manual page for details.</p>
<p class="Pp">The routine <b>mcprint</b> was not present in any previous curses
    implementation. See the <b>curs_print</b>(3X) manual page for details.</p>
<p class="Pp">The routine <b>wresize</b> is not part of XPG4, nor is it present
    in SVr4. See the <b>wresize</b>(3X) manual page for details.</p>
<p class="Pp">The WINDOW structure's internal details can be hidden from
    application programs. See <b>curs_opaque</b>(3X) for the discussion of
    <b>is_scrollok</b>, etc.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">In historic curses versions, delays embedded in the capabilities
    <b>cr</b>, <b>ind</b>, <b>cub1</b>, <b>ff</b> and <b>tab</b> activated
    corresponding delay bits in the UNIX tty driver. In this implementation, all
    padding is done by sending NUL bytes. This method is slightly more
    expensive, but narrows the interface to the UNIX kernel significantly and
    increases the package's portability correspondingly.</p>
