   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

  	# BS - start boxed text
  	# ^y = starting y location
  	# ^b = 1
  	# BE - end boxed text (draw box now)
  	Draw four-sided box normally, but don't draw top of
  	box if the box started on an earlier page.
  	# VS - start vertical sidebar
  	# ^Y = starting y location
  	# ^v = 1 (for troff;  for nroff this doesn't matter)
  	# VE - end of vertical sidebar
  	# Special macro to handle page bottom:  finish off current
  	# box/sidebar if in box/sidebar mode, then invoked standard
  	# page bottom macro.
  	Draw three-sided box if this is the box's first page,

<h1 class="Sh" id="INTRODUCTION"><a class="permalink" href="#INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</a></h1>
Beginning with the 8.1 release, the Tcl core is thread safe, which allows you to
  incorporate Tcl into multithreaded applications without customizing the Tcl
  core. To enable Tcl multithreading support, you must include the
  <b>--enable-threads</b> option to <b>configure</b> when you configure and
  compile your Tcl core.
<p class="Pp">An important constraint of the Tcl threads implementation is that
    <i>only the thread that created a Tcl interpreter can use that</i>
    <i>interpreter</i>. In other words, multiple threads can not access the same
    Tcl interpreter. (However, a single thread can safely create and use
    multiple interpreters.)</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
Tcl provides <b>Tcl_CreateThread</b> for creating threads. The caller can
  determine the size of the stack given to the new thread and modify the
  behaviour through the supplied <i>flags</i>. The value
  <b>TCL_THREAD_STACK_DEFAULT</b> for the <i>stackSize</i> indicates that the
  default size as specified by the operating system is to be used for the new
  thread. As for the flags, currently only the values <b>TCL_THREAD_NOFLAGS</b>
  and <b>TCL_THREAD_JOINABLE</b> are defined. The first of them invokes the
  default behaviour with no specialties. Using the second value marks the new
  thread as <i>joinable</i>. This means that another thread can wait for the
  such marked thread to exit and join it.
<p class="Pp">Restrictions: On some UNIX systems the pthread-library does not
    contain the functionality to specify the stack size of a thread. The
    specified value for the stack size is ignored on these systems. Windows
    currently does not support joinable threads. This flag value is therefore
    ignored on this platform.</p>
<p class="Pp">Tcl provides the <b>Tcl_ExitThread</b> and
    <b>Tcl_FinalizeThread</b> functions for terminating threads and invoking
    optional per-thread exit handlers. See the <b>Tcl_Exit</b> page for more
    information on these procedures.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>Tcl_JoinThread</b> function is provided to allow threads to
    wait upon the exit of another thread, which must have been marked as
    joinable through usage of the <b>TCL_THREAD_JOINABLE</b>-flag during its
    creation via <b>Tcl_CreateThread</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Trying to wait for the exit of a non-joinable thread or a thread
    which is already waited upon will result in an error. Waiting for a joinable
    thread which already exited is possible, the system will retain the
    necessary information until after the call to <b>Tcl_JoinThread</b>. This
    means that not calling <b>Tcl_JoinThread</b> for a joinable thread will
    cause a memory leak.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>Tcl_GetThreadData</b> call returns a pointer to a block of
    thread-private data. Its argument is a key that is shared by all threads and
    a size for the block of storage. The storage is automatically allocated and
    initialized to all zeros the first time each thread asks for it. The storage
    is automatically deallocated by <b>Tcl_FinalizeThread</b>.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="SYNCHRONIZATION_AND_COMMUNICATION"><a class="permalink" href="#SYNCHRONIZATION_AND_COMMUNICATION">SYNCHRONIZATION
  AND COMMUNICATION</a></h2>
Tcl provides <b>Tcl_ThreadQueueEvent</b> and <b>Tcl_ThreadAlert</b> for handling
  event queuing in multithreaded applications. See the <b>Notifier</b> manual
  page for more information on these procedures.
<p class="Pp">A mutex is a lock that is used to serialize all threads through a
    piece of code by calling <b>Tcl_MutexLock</b> and <b>Tcl_MutexUnlock</b>. If
    one thread holds a mutex, any other thread calling <b>Tcl_MutexLock</b> will
    block until <b>Tcl_MutexUnlock</b> is called. A mutex can be destroyed after
    its use by calling <b>Tcl_MutexFinalize</b>. The result of locking a mutex
    twice from the same thread is undefined. On some platforms it will result in
    a deadlock. The <b>Tcl_MutexLock</b>, <b>Tcl_MutexUnlock</b> and
    <b>Tcl_MutexFinalize</b> procedures are defined as empty macros if not
    compiling with threads enabled. For declaration of mutexes the
    <b>TCL_DECLARE_MUTEX</b> macro should be used. This macro assures correct
    mutex handling even when the core is compiled without threads enabled.</p>
<p class="Pp">A condition variable is used as a signaling mechanism: a thread
    can lock a mutex and then wait on a condition variable with
    <b>Tcl_ConditionWait</b>. This atomically releases the mutex lock and blocks
    the waiting thread until another thread calls <b>Tcl_ConditionNotify</b>.
    The caller of <b>Tcl_ConditionNotify</b> should have the associated mutex
    held by previously calling <b>Tcl_MutexLock</b>, but this is not enforced.
    Notifying the condition variable unblocks all threads waiting on the
    condition variable, but they do not proceed until the mutex is released with
    <b>Tcl_MutexUnlock</b>. The implementation of <b>Tcl_ConditionWait</b>
    automatically locks the mutex before returning.</p>
<p class="Pp">The caller of <b>Tcl_ConditionWait</b> should be prepared for
    spurious notifications by calling <b>Tcl_ConditionWait</b> within a while
    loop that tests some invariant.</p>
<p class="Pp">A condition variable can be destroyed after its use by calling
    <b>Tcl_ConditionFinalize</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>Tcl_ConditionNotify</b>, <b>Tcl_ConditionWait</b> and
    <b>Tcl_ConditionFinalize</b> procedures are defined as empty macros if not
    compiling with threads enabled.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="INITIALIZATION"><a class="permalink" href="#INITIALIZATION">INITIALIZATION</a></h2>
All of these synchronization objects are self-initializing. They are implemented
  as opaque pointers that should be NULL upon first use. The mutexes and
  condition variables are either cleaned up by process exit handlers (if living
  that long) or explicitly by calls to <b>Tcl_MutexFinalize</b> or
  <b>Tcl_ConditionFinalize</b>. Thread local storage is reclaimed during
  <b>Tcl_FinalizeThread</b>.

<h1 class="Sh" id="SCRIPT-LEVEL_ACCESS_TO_THREADS"><a class="permalink" href="#SCRIPT-LEVEL_ACCESS_TO_THREADS">SCRIPT-LEVEL
  ACCESS TO THREADS</a></h1>
Tcl provides no built-in commands for scripts to use to create, manage, or join
  threads, nor any script-level access to mutex or condition variables. It
  provides such facilities only via C interfaces, and leaves it up to packages
  to expose these matters to the script level. One such package is the
  <b>Thread</b> package.
