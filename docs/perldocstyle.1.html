<p class="Pp">perldocstyle - A style guide for writing Perl's documentation</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">This document is a guide for the authorship and maintenance of the
    documentation that ships with Perl. This includes the following:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>The several dozen manual sections whose filenames begin with
      &quot;<span class="Li">&quot;perl&quot;</span>&quot;, such as
      <span class="Li">&quot;perlobj&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;perlre&quot;</span>, and
      <span class="Li">&quot;perlintro&quot;</span>. (And, yes,
      <span class="Li">&quot;perl&quot;</span>.)</li>
  <li>The documentation for all the modules included with Perl (as listed by
      <span class="Li">&quot;perlmodlib&quot;</span>).</li>
  <li>The hundreds of individually presented reference sections derived from the
      <span class="Li">&quot;perlfunc&quot;</span> file.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">This guide will hereafter refer to user-manual section files as
    <i>man</i> <i>pages</i>, per Unix convention.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Purpose_of_this_guide"><a class="permalink" href="#Purpose_of_this_guide">Purpose
  of this guide</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">This style guide aims to establish standards, procedures, and
    philosophies applicable to Perl's core documentation.</p>
<p class="Pp">Adherence to these standards will help ensure that any one part of
    Perl's manual has a tone and style consistent with that of any other. As
    with the rest of the Perl project, the language's documentation collection
    is an open-source project authored over a long period of time by many
    people. Maintaining consistency across such a wide swath of work presents a
    challenge; this guide provides a foundation to help mitigate this
    difficulty.</p>
<p class="Pp">This will help its readers--especially those new to Perl--to feel
    more welcome and engaged with Perl's documentation, and this in turn will
    help the Perl project itself grow stronger through having a larger, more
    diverse, and more confident population of knowledgeable users.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Intended_audience"><a class="permalink" href="#Intended_audience">Intended
  audience</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Anyone interested in contributing to Perl's core documentation
    should familiarize themselves with the standards outlined by this guide.</p>
<p class="Pp">Programmers documenting their own work apart from the Perl project
    itself may also find this guide worthwhile, especially if they wish their
    work to extend the tone and style of Perl's own manual.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Status_of_this_document"><a class="permalink" href="#Status_of_this_document">Status
  of this document</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">This guide was initially drafted in late 2020, drawing from the
    documentation style guides of several open-source technologies contemporary
    with Perl. This has included Python, Raku, Rust, and the Linux kernel.</p>
<p class="Pp">The author intends to see this guide used as starting place from
    which to launch a review of Perl's reams of extant documentation, with the
    expectation that those conducting this review should grow and modify this
    guide as needed to account for the requirements and quirks particular to
    Perl's programming manual.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Choice_of_markup:_Pod"><a class="permalink" href="#Choice_of_markup:_Pod">Choice
  of markup: Pod</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">All of Perl's core documentation uses Pod (&quot;Plain Old
    Documentation&quot;), a simple markup language, to format its source text.
    Pod is similar in spirit to other contemporary lightweight markup
    technologies, such as Markdown and reStructuredText, and has a decades-long
    shared history with Perl itself.</p>
<p class="Pp">For a comprehensive reference to Pod syntax, see
    <span class="Li">&quot;perlpod&quot;</span>. For the sake of reading this
    guide, familiarity with the Pod syntax for section headers
    (<span class="Li">&quot;=head2&quot;</span>, et cetera) and for inline text
    formatting (<span class="Li">&quot;C&lt;like this&gt;&quot;</span>) should
    suffice.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl programmers also use Pod to document their own scripts,
    libraries, and modules. This use of Pod has its own style guide, outlined by
    <span class="Li">&quot;perlpodstyle&quot;</span>.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Choice_of_language:_American_English"><a class="permalink" href="#Choice_of_language:_American_English">Choice
  of language: American English</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Perl's core documentation is written in English, with a preference
    for American spelling of words and expression of phrases. That means
    &quot;color&quot; over &quot;colour&quot;, &quot;math&quot; versus
    &quot;maths&quot;, &quot;the team has decided&quot; and not &quot;the team
    have decided&quot;, and so on.</p>
<p class="Pp">We name one style of English for the sake of consistency across
    Perl's documentation, much as a software project might declare a four-space
    indentation standard--even when that doesn't affect how well the code
    compiles. Both efforts result in an easier read by avoiding jarring,
    mid-document changes in format or style.</p>
<p class="Pp">Contributors to Perl's documentation should note that this rule
    describes the ultimate, published output of the project, and does not
    prescribe the dialect used within community contributions. The documentation
    team enthusiastically welcomes any English-language contributions, and will
    actively assist in Americanizing spelling and style when warranted.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Other languages and translations</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Community-authored translations of Perl's documentation do exist,
    covering a variety of languages. While the Perl project appreciates these
    translation efforts and promotes them when applicable, it does not
    officially support or maintain any of them.</p>
<p class="Pp">That said, keeping Perl's documentation clear, simple, and short
    has a welcome side effect of aiding any such translation project.</p>
<p class="Pp">(Note that the Chinese, Japanese, and Korean-language README files
    included with Perl's source distributions provide an exception to this
    choice of language--but these documents fall outside the scope of this
    guide.)</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Choice_of_encoding:_"><a class="permalink" href="#Choice_of_encoding:_">Choice
  of encoding: UTF-8</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Perl's core documentation files are encoded in UTF-8, and can make
    use of the full range of characters this encoding allows.</p>
<p class="Pp">As such, every core doc file (or the Pod section of every core
    module) should commence with an <span class="Li">&quot;=encoding
    utf8&quot;</span> declaration.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Choice_of_underlying_style_guide:_"><a class="permalink" href="#Choice_of_underlying_style_guide:_">Choice
  of underlying style guide: CMOS</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Perl's documentation uses the Chicago Manual of Style
    &lt;https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org&gt; (CMOS), 17th Edition, as its
    baseline guide for style and grammar. While the document you are currently
    reading endeavors to serve as an adequate stand-alone style guide for the
    purposes of documenting Perl, authors should consider CMOS the fallback
    authority for any pertinent topics not covered here.</p>
<p class="Pp">Because CMOS is not a free resource, access to it is not a
    prerequisite for contributing to Perl's documentation; the doc team will
    help contributors learn about and apply its guidelines as needed. However,
    we do encourage anyone interested in significant doc contributions to obtain
    or at least read through CMOS. (Copies are likely available through most
    public libraries, and CMOS-derived fundamentals can be found online as
    well.)</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Contributing_to_Perl's_documentation"><a class="permalink" href="#Contributing_to_Perl's_documentation">Contributing
  to Perl's documentation</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Perl, like any programming language, is only as good as its
    documentation. Perl depends upon clear, friendly, and thorough documentation
    in order to welcome brand-new users, teach and explain the language's
    various concepts and components, and serve as a lifelong reference for
    experienced Perl programmers. As such, the Perl project welcomes and values
    all community efforts to improve the language's documentation.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl accepts documentation contributions through the same
    open-source project pipeline as code contributions. See
    <span class="Li">&quot;perlhack&quot;</span> for more information.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="FORMATTING_AND_STRUCTURE"><a class="permalink" href="#FORMATTING_AND_STRUCTURE">FORMATTING
  AND STRUCTURE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">This section details specific Pod syntax and style that all core
    Perl documentation should adhere to, in the interest of consistency and
    readability.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Document_structure"><a class="permalink" href="#Document_structure">Document
  structure</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Each individual work of core Perl documentation, whether contained
    within a <span class="Li">&quot;.pod&quot;</span> file or in the Pod section
    of a standard code module, patterns its structure after a number of
    long-time Unix man page conventions. (Hence this guide's use of &quot;man
    page&quot; to refer to any one self-contained part of Perl's
  documentation.)</p>
<p class="Pp">Adhering to these conventions helps Pod formatters present a Perl
    man page's content in different contexts--whether a terminal, the web, or
    even print. Many of the following requirements originate with
    <span class="Li">&quot;perlpodstyle&quot;</span>, which derives its
    recommendations in turn from these well-established practices.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Name</i></p>
<p class="Pp">After its <span class="Li">&quot;=encoding utf8&quot;</span>
    declaration, a Perl man page <i>must</i> present a level-one header named
    &quot;NAME&quot; (literally), followed by a paragraph containing the page's
    name and a very brief description.</p>
<p class="Pp">The first few lines of a notional page named
    <span class="Li">&quot;perlpodexample&quot;</span>:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    =encoding utf8
    =head1 NAME
    perlpodexample - An example of formatting a manual page's title line
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><i>Description and synopsis</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Most Perl man pages also contain a DESCRIPTION section featuring a
    summary of, or introduction to, the document's content and purpose.</p>
<p class="Pp">This section should also, one way or another, clearly identify the
    audience that the page addresses, especially if it has expectations about
    the reader's prior knowledge. For example, a man page that dives deep into
    the inner workings of Perl's regular expression engine should state its
    assumptions up front--and quickly redirect readers who are instead looking
    for a more basic reference or tutorial.</p>
<p class="Pp">Reference pages, when appropriate, can precede the DESCRIPTION
    with a SYNOPSIS section that lists, within one or more code blocks, some
    very brief examples of the referenced feature's use. This section should
    show a handful of common-case and best-practice examples, rather than an
    exhaustive list of every obscure method or alternate syntax available.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Other sections and subsections</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Pages should conclude, when appropriate, with a SEE ALSO section
    containing hyperlinks to relevant sections of Perl's manual, other Unix man
    pages, or appropriate web pages. Hyperlink each such cross-reference via
    <span class="Li">&quot;L&lt;...&gt;&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">What other sections to include depends entirely upon the topic at
    hand. Authors should feel free to include further
    <span class="Li">&quot;=head1&quot;</span>-level sections, whether other
    standard ones listed by <span class="Li">&quot;perlpodstyle&quot;</span>, or
    ones specific to the page's topic; in either case, render these top-level
    headings in all-capital letters.</p>
<p class="Pp">You may then include as many subsections beneath them as needed to
    meet the standards of clarity, accessibility, and cross-reference affinity
    suggested elsewhere in this guide.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Author and copyright</i></p>
<p class="Pp">In most circumstances, Perl's stand-alone man pages--those
    contained within <span class="Li">&quot;.pod&quot;</span> files--do not need
    to include any copyright or license information about themselves. Their
    source Pod files are part of Perl's own core software repository, and that
    already covers them under the same copyright and license terms as Perl
    itself. You do not need to include additional &quot;LICENSE&quot; or
    &quot;COPYRIGHT&quot; sections of your own.</p>
<p class="Pp">These man pages may optionally credit their primary author, or
    include a list of significant contributors, under &quot;AUTHOR&quot; or
    &quot;CONTRIBUTORS&quot; headings. Note that the presence of authors' names
    does not preclude a given page from writing in a voice consistent with the
    rest of Perl's documentation.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that these guidelines do not apply to the core software
    modules that ship with Perl. These have their own standards for authorship
    and copyright statements, as found in
    <span class="Li">&quot;perlpodstyle&quot;</span>.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Formatting_rules"><a class="permalink" href="#Formatting_rules">Formatting
  rules</a></h2>
<p class="Pp"><i>Line length and line wrap</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Each line within a Perl man page's Pod source file should measure
    72 characters or fewer in length.</p>
<p class="Pp">Please break paragraphs up into blocks of short lines, rather than
    &quot;soft wrapping&quot; paragraphs across hundreds of characters with no
    line breaks.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Code blocks</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Just like the text around them, all code examples should be as
    short and readable as possible, displaying no more complexity than
    absolutely necessary to illustrate the concept at hand.</p>
<p class="Pp">For the sake of consistency within and across Perl's man pages,
    all examples must adhere to the code-layout principles set out by
    <span class="Li">&quot;perlstyle&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Sample code should deviate from these standards only when
    necessary: during a demonstration of how Perl disregards whitespace, for
    example, or to temporarily switch to two-column indentation for an
    unavoidably verbose illustration.</p>
<p class="Pp">You may include comments within example code to further clarify or
    label the code's behavior in-line. You may also use comments as placeholder
    for code normally present but not relevant to the current topic, like
  so:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    while (my $line = &lt;$fh&gt;) {
        #
        # (Do something interesting with $line here.)
        #
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Even the simplest code blocks often require the use of example
    variables and subroutines, whose names you should choose with care.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Inline code and literals</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Within a paragraph of text, use
    <span class="Li">&quot;C&lt;...&gt;&quot;</span> when quoting or referring
    to any bit of Perl code--even if it is only one character long.</p>
<p class="Pp">For instance, when referring within an explanatory paragraph to
    Perl's operator for adding two numbers together, you'd write
    &quot;<span class="Li">&quot;C&lt;+&gt;&quot;</span>&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Function names</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Use <span class="Li">&quot;C&lt;...&gt;&quot;</span> to render all
    Perl function names in monospace, whenever they appear in text.</p>
<p class="Pp">Unless you need to specifically quote a function call with a list
    of arguments, do not follow a function's name in text with a pair of empty
    parentheses. That is, when referring in general to Perl's
    <span class="Li">&quot;print&quot;</span> function, write it as
    &quot;<span class="Li">&quot;print&quot;</span>&quot;, not
    &quot;<span class="Li">&quot;print()&quot;</span>&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Function arguments</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Represent functions' expected arguments in all-caps, with no
    sigils, and using <span class="Li">&quot;C&lt;...&gt;&quot;</span> to render
    them in monospace. These arguments should have short names making their
    nature and purpose clear. Convention specifies a few ones commonly seen
    throughout Perl's documentation:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>EXPR
    <p class="Pp">The &quot;generic&quot; argument: any scalar value, or a Perl
        expression that evaluates to one.</p>
  </li>
  <li>ARRAY
    <p class="Pp">An array, stored in a named variable.</p>
  </li>
  <li>HASH
    <p class="Pp">A hash, stored in a named variable.</p>
  </li>
  <li>BLOCK
    <p class="Pp">A curly-braced code block, or a subroutine reference.</p>
  </li>
  <li>LIST
    <p class="Pp">Any number of values, stored across any number of variables or
        expressions, which the function will &quot;flatten&quot; and treat as a
        single list. (And because it can contain any number of variables, it
        must be the <i>last</i> argument, when present.)</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">When possible, give scalar arguments names that suggest their
    purpose among the arguments. See, for example,
    <span class="Li">&quot;substr&quot;</span>'s documentation, whose listed
    arguments include <span class="Li">&quot;EXPR&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;OFFSET&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;LENGTH&quot;</span>, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;REPLACEMENT&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Apostrophes, quotes, and dashes</i></p>
<p class="Pp">In Pod source, use straight quotes, and not &quot;curly
    quotes&quot;: &quot;Like
  <br/>
   this&quot;, not Xlike thisX. The same goes for apostrophes: Here's a
  <br/>
   positive example, and hereXs a negative one.</p>
<p class="Pp">Render em dashes as two hyphens--like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    Render em dashes as two hyphens--like this.
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Leave it up to formatters to reformat and reshape these
    punctuation marks as best fits their respective target media.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Unix programs and C functions</i></p>
<p class="Pp">When referring to a Unix program or C function with its own man
    page (outside of Perl's documentation), include its manual section number in
    parentheses. For example: <span class="Li">malloc(3)</span>, or
    <span class="Li">mkdir(1)</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">If mentioning this program for the first time within a man page or
    section, make it a cross reference, e.g.
    <span class="Li">&quot;L&lt;malloc(3)&gt;&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Do not otherwise style this text.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Cross-references and hyperlinks</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Make generous use of Pod's
    <span class="Li">&quot;L&lt;...&gt;&quot;</span> syntax to create hyperlinks
    to other parts of the current man page, or to other documents entirely --
    whether elsewhere on the reader's computer, or somewhere on the internet,
    via URL.</p>
<p class="Pp">Use <span class="Li">&quot;L&lt;...&gt;&quot;</span> to link to
    another section of the current man page when mentioning it, and make use of
    its page-and-section syntax to link to the most specific section of a
    separate page within Perl's documentation. Generally, the first time you
    refer to a specific function, program, or concept within a certain page or
    section, consider linking to its full documentation.</p>
<p class="Pp">Hyperlinks do not supersede other formatting required by this
    guide; Pod allows nested text formats, and you should use this feature as
    needed.</p>
<p class="Pp">Here is an example sentence that mentions Perl's
    <span class="Li">&quot;say&quot;</span> function, with a link to its
    documentation section within the
    <span class="Li">&quot;perlfunc&quot;</span> man page:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    In version 5.10, Perl added support for the 
    L&lt;C&lt;say&gt;|perlfunc/say FILEHANDLE LIST&gt; function.
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Note the use of the vertical pipe
    (&quot;<span class="Li">&quot;|&quot;</span>&quot;) to separate how the link
    will appear to readers
    (&quot;<span class="Li">&quot;C&lt;say&gt;&quot;</span>&quot;) from the full
    page-and-section specifier that the formatter links to.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Tables and diagrams</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Pod does not officially support tables. To best present tabular
    data, include the table as both HTML and plain-text representations--the
    latter as an indented code block. Use
    <span class="Li">&quot;=begin&quot;</span> /
    <span class="Li">&quot;=end&quot;</span> directives to target these tables
    at <span class="Li">&quot;html&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;text&quot;</span> Pod formatters, respectively. For
    example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    =head2 Table of fruits
    =begin text
     Name           Shape           Color
     =====================================
     Apple          Round           Red
     Banana         Long            Yellow
     Pear           Pear-shaped     Green
    =end text
    =begin html
    &lt;table&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Name&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Shape&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Color&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Apple&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Round&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Red&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Banana&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Long&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Yellow&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Pear&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Pear-shaped&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Green&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    =end html
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The same holds true for figures and graphical illustrations. Pod
    does not natively support inline graphics, but you can mix HTML
    <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;img&gt;&quot;</span> tags with monospaced
    text-art representations of those images' content.</p>
<p class="Pp">Due in part to these limitations, most Perl man pages use neither
    tables nor diagrams. Like any other tool in your documentation toolkit,
    however, you may consider their inclusion when they would improve an
    explanation's clarity without adding to its complexity.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Adding_comments"><a class="permalink" href="#Adding_comments">Adding
  comments</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Like any other kind of source code, Pod lets you insert comments
    visible only to other people reading the source directly, and ignored by the
    formatting programs that transform Pod into various human-friendly output
    formats (such as HTML or PDF).</p>
<p class="Pp">To comment Pod text, use the
    <span class="Li">&quot;=for&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;=begin&quot;</span> /
    <span class="Li">&quot;=end&quot;</span> Pod directives, aiming them at a
    (notional) formatter called
    &quot;<span class="Li">&quot;comment&quot;</span>&quot;. A couple of
    examples:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    =for comment Using &quot;=for comment&quot; like this is good for short,
    single-paragraph comments.
    =begin comment
    If you need to comment out more than one paragraph, use a
    =begin/=end block, like this.
    None of the text or markup in this whole example would be visible to

<h2 class="Ss" id="Perlfunc_has_special_rules"><a class="permalink" href="#Perlfunc_has_special_rules">Perlfunc
  has special rules</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;perlfunc&quot;</span> man page, an
    exhaustive reference of every Perl built-in function, has a handful of
    formatting rules not seen elsewhere in Perl's documentation.</p>
<p class="Pp">Software used during Perl's build process (Pod::Functions) parses
    this page according to certain rules, in order to build separate man pages
    for each of Perl's functions, as well as achieve other indexing effects. As
    such, contributors to perlfunc must know about and adhere to its particular
    rules.</p>
<p class="Pp">Most of the perfunc man page comprises a single list, found under
    the header &quot;Alphabetical Listing of Perl Functions&quot;. Each function
    reference is an entry on that list, made of three parts, in order:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>1.</dt>
  <dd>A list of <span class="Li">&quot;=item&quot;</span> lines which each
      demonstrate, in template format, a way to call this function. One line
      should exist for every combination of arguments that the function accepts
      (including no arguments at all, if applicable).
    <p class="Pp">If modern best practices prefer certain ways to invoke the
        function over others, then those ways should lead the list.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The first item of the list should be immediately followed by
        one or more <span class="Li">&quot;X&lt;...&gt;&quot;</span> terms
        listing index-worthy topics; if nothing else, then the name of the
        function, with no arguments.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>2.</dt>
  <dd>A <span class="Li">&quot;=for&quot;</span> line, directed at
      <span class="Li">&quot;Pod::Functions&quot;</span>, containing a one-line
      description of what the function does. This is written as a phrase, led
      with an imperative verb, with neither leading capitalization nor ending
      punctuation. Examples include &quot;quote a list of words&quot; and
      &quot;change a filename&quot;.</dd>
  <dt>3.</dt>
  <dd>The function's definition and reference material, including all
      explanatory text and code examples.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Complex functions that need their text divided into subsections
    (under the principles of &quot;Apply section-breaks and examples
    generously&quot;) may do so by using sublists, with
    <span class="Li">&quot;=item&quot;</span> elements as header text.</p>
<p class="Pp">A fictional function
    &quot;<span class="Li">&quot;myfunc&quot;</span>&quot;, which takes a list
    as an optional argument, might have an entry in perlfunc shaped like
  this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    =item myfunc LIST
    X&lt;myfunc&gt;
    =item myfunc
    =for Pod::Functions demonstrate a function's perlfunc section 
    [ Main part of function definition goes here, with examples ]

<h2 class="Ss" id="Apply_one_of_the_four_documentation_modes"><a class="permalink" href="#Apply_one_of_the_four_documentation_modes">Apply
  one of the four documentation modes</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Aside from &quot;meta&quot; documentation such as
    <span class="Li">&quot;perlhist&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;perlartistic&quot;</span>, each of Perl's man pages
    should conform to one of the four documentation &quot;modes&quot; suggested
    by <i>The Documentation System</i> by Daniele Procida
    &lt;https://documentation.divio.com&gt;. These include tutorials, cookbooks,
    explainers, and references--terms that we define in further detail
  below.</p>
<p class="Pp">Each mode of documentation speaks to a different audience--not
    just people of different backgrounds and skill levels, but individual
    readers whose needs from language documentation can shift depending upon
    context. For example, a programmer with plenty of time to learn a new
    concept about Perl can ease into a tutorial about it, and later expand their
    knowledge further by studying an explainer. Later, that same programmer,
    wading knee-deep in live code and needing only to look up some function's
    exact syntax, will want to reach for a reference page instead.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl's documentation must strive to meet these different
    situational expectations by limiting each man page to a single mode. This
    helps writers ensure they provide readers with the documentation needed or
    expected, despite ever-evolving situations.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Tutorial</i></p>
<p class="Pp">A tutorial man page focuses on <b>learning</b>, ideally by
    <i>doing</i>. It presents the reader with small, interesting examples that
    allow them to follow along themselves using their own Perl interpreter. The
    tutorial inspires comprehension by letting its readers immediately
    experience (and experiment on) the concept in question. Examples include
    <span class="Li">&quot;perlxstut&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;perlpacktut&quot;</span>, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;perlretut&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Tutorial man pages must strive for a welcoming and reassuring tone
    from their outset; they may very well be the first things that a newcomer to
    Perl reads, playing a significant role in whether they choose to stick
    around. Even an experienced programmer can benefit from the sense of courage
    imparted by a strong tutorial about a more advanced topic. After completing
    a tutorial, a reader should feel like they've been led from zero knowledge
    of its topic to having an invigorating spark of basic understanding, excited
    to learn more and experiment further.</p>
<p class="Pp">Tutorials can certainly use real-world examples when that helps
    make for clear, relatable demonstrations, so long as they keep the focus on
    teaching--more practical problem-solving should be left to the realm of
    cookbooks (as described below). Tutorials also needn't concern themselves
    with explanations into why or how things work beneath the surface, or
    explorations of alternate syntaxes and solutions; these are better handled
    by explainers and reference pages.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Cookbook</i></p>
<p class="Pp">A cookbook man page focuses on <b>results</b>. Just like its name
    suggests, it presents succinct, step-by-step solutions to a variety of
    real-world problems around some topic. A cookbook's code examples serve less
    to enlighten and more to provide quick, paste-ready solutions that the
    reader can apply immediately to the situation facing them.</p>
<p class="Pp">A Perl cookbook demonstrates ways that all the tools and
    techniques explained elsewhere can work together in order to achieve
    practical results. Any explanation deeper than that belongs in explainers
    and reference pages, instead. (Certainly, a cookbook can cross-reference
    other man pages in order to satisfy the curiosity of readers who, with their
    immediate problems solved, wish to learn more.)</p>
<p class="Pp">The most prominent cookbook pages that ship with Perl itself are
    its many FAQ pages, in particular
    <span class="Li">&quot;perlfaq4&quot;</span> and up, which provide short
    solutions to practical questions in question-and-answer style.
    <span class="Li">&quot;perlunicook&quot;</span> shows another example,
    containing a bevy of practical code snippets for a variety of
    internationally minded text manipulations.</p>
<p class="Pp">(An aside: <i>The Documentation System</i> calls this mode
    &quot;how-to&quot;, but Perl's history of creative cuisine prefers the more
    kitchen-ready term that we employ here.)</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Reference</i></p>
<p class="Pp">A reference page focuses on <b>description</b>. Austere, uniform,
    and succinct, reference pages--often arranged into a whole section of
    mutually similar subpages--lend themselves well to &quot;random access&quot;
    by a reader who knows precisely what knowledge they need, requiring only the
    minimum amount of information before returning to the task at hand.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl's own best example of a reference work is
    <span class="Li">&quot;perlfunc&quot;</span>, the sprawling man page that
    details the operation of every function built into Perl, with each
    function's documentation presenting the same kinds of information in the
    same order as every other. For an example of a shorter reference on a single
    topic, look at <span class="Li">&quot;perlreref&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Module documentation--including that of all the modules listed in
    <span class="Li">&quot;perlmodlib&quot;</span>--also counts as reference.
    They follow precepts similar to those laid down by the
    <span class="Li">&quot;perlpodstyle&quot;</span> man page, such as opening
    with an example-laden &quot;SYNOPSIS&quot; section, or featuring a
    &quot;METHODS&quot; section that succinctly lists and defines an
    object-oriented module's public interface.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Explainer</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Explainer pages focus on <b>discussion</b>. Each explainer dives
    as deep as needed into some Perl-relevant topic, taking all the time and
    space needed to give the reader a thorough understanding of it. Explainers
    mean to impart knowledge through study. They don't assume that the student
    has a Perl interpreter fired up and hungry for immediate examples (as with a
    tutorial), or specific Perl problems that they need quick answers for (which
    cookbooks and reference pages can help with).</p>
<p class="Pp">Outside of its reference pages, most of Perl's manual belongs to
    this mode. This includes the majority of the man pages whose names start
    with &quot;<span class="Li">&quot;perl&quot;</span>&quot;. A fine example is
    <span class="Li">&quot;perlsyn&quot;</span>, the Perl Syntax page, which
    explores the whys and wherefores of Perl's unique syntax in a wide-ranging
    discussion laden with many references to the language's history, culture,
    and driving philosophies.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl's explainer pages give authors a chance to explore Perl's
    penchant for TMTOWTDI, illustrating alternate and even obscure ways to use
    the language feature under discussion. However, as the remainder of this
    guide discusses, the ideal Perl documentation manages to deliver its message
    clearly and concisely, and not confuse mere wordiness for completeness.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Further notes on documentation modes</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Keep in mind that the purpose of this categorization is not to
    dictate content--a very thorough explainer might contain short reference
    sections of its own, for example, or a reference page about a very complex
    function might resemble an explainer in places (e.g.
    <span class="Li">&quot;open&quot;</span>). Rather, it makes sure that the
    authors and contributors of any given man page agree on what sort of
    audience that page addresses.</p>
<p class="Pp">If a new or otherwise uncategorized man page presents itself as
    resistant to fitting into only one of the four modes, consider breaking it
    up into separate pages. That may mean creating a new
    &quot;<span class="Li">&quot;perl[...]&quot;</span>&quot; man page, or (in
    the case of module documentation) making new packages underneath that
    module's namespace that serve only to hold additional documentation. For
    instance, <span class="Li">&quot;Example::Module&quot;</span>'s reference
    documentation might include a see-also link to
    <span class="Li">&quot;Example::Module::Cookbook&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl's several man pages about Unicode--comprising a short
    tutorial, a thorough explainer, a cookbook, and a FAQ--provide a fine
    example of spreading a complicated topic across several man pages with
    different and clearly indicated purposes.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Assume_readers'_intelligence,_but_not_their_knowledge"><a class="permalink" href="#Assume_readers'_intelligence,_but_not_their_knowledge">Assume
  readers' intelligence, but not their knowledge</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Perl has grown a great deal from its humble beginnings as a tool
    for people already well versed in C programming and various Unix utilities.
    Today, a person learning Perl might come from any social or technological
    background, with a range of possible motivations stretching far beyond
    system administration.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl's core documentation must recognize this by making as few
    assumptions as possible about the reader's prior knowledge. While you should
    assume that readers of Perl's documentation are smart, curious, and eager to
    learn, you should not confuse this for pre-existing knowledge about any
    other technology, or even programming in general--especially in tutorial or
    introductory material.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Keep Perl's documentation about Perl</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Outside of pages tasked specifically with exploring Perl's
    relationship with other programming languages, the documentation should keep
    the focus on Perl. Avoid drawing analogies to other technologies that the
    reader may not have familiarity with.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, when documenting one of Perl's built-in functions,
    write as if the reader is now learning about that function for the first
    time, in any programming language.</p>
<p class="Pp">Choosing to instead compare it to an equivalent or underlying C
    function will probably not illuminate much understanding in a contemporary
    reader. Worse, this can risk leaving readers unfamiliar with C feeling
    locked out from fully understanding of the topic--to say nothing of readers
    new to computer programming altogether.</p>
<p class="Pp">If, however, that function's ties to its C roots can lead to
    deeper understanding with practical applications for a Perl programmer, you
    may mention that link after its more immediately useful documentation.
    Otherwise, omit this information entirely, leaving it for other
    documentation or external articles more concerned with examining Perl's
    underlying implementation details.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Deploy jargon when needed, but define it as well</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Domain-specific jargon has its place, especially within
    documentation. However, if a man page makes use of jargon that a typical
    reader might not already know, then that page should make an effort to
    define the term in question early-on--either explicitly, or via cross
    reference.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, Perl loves working with filehandles, and as such that
    word appears throughout its documentation. A new Perl programmer arriving at
    a man page for the first time is quite likely to have no idea what a
    &quot;filehandle&quot; is, though. Any Perl man page mentioning filehandles
    should, at the very least, hyperlink that term to an explanation elsewhere
    in Perl's documentation. If appropriate--for example, in the lead-in to
    <span class="Li">&quot;open&quot;</span> function's detailed reference--it
    can also include a very short in-place definition of the concept for the
    reader's convenience.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Use_meaningful_variable_and_symbol_names_in_examples"><a class="permalink" href="#Use_meaningful_variable_and_symbol_names_in_examples">Use
  meaningful variable and symbol names in examples</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">When quickly sketching out examples, English-speaking programmers
    have a long tradition of using short nonsense words as placeholders for
    variables and other symbols--such as the venerable
    <span class="Li">&quot;foo&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;bar&quot;</span>, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;baz&quot;</span>. Example code found in a programming
    language's official, permanent documentation, however, can and should make
    an effort to provide a little more clarity through specificity.</p>
<p class="Pp">Whenever possible, code examples should give variables, classes,
    and other programmer-defined symbols names that clearly demonstrate their
    function and their relationship to one another. For example, if an example
    requires that one class show an &quot;is-a&quot; relationship with another,
    consider naming them something like
    <span class="Li">&quot;Apple&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;Fruit&quot;</span>, rather than
    <span class="Li">&quot;Foo&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;Bar&quot;</span>. Similarly, sample code creating an
    instance of that class would do better to name it
    <span class="Li">$apple</span>, rather than
  <span class="Li">$baz</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Even the simplest examples benefit from clear language using
    concrete words. Prefer a construct like <span class="Li">&quot;for my $item
    (@items) { ... }&quot;</span> over <span class="Li">&quot;for my $blah
    (@blah) { ... }&quot;</span>.</p>

  in English, but not just for English-speakers</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">While this style guide does specify American English as the
    documentation's language for the sake of internal consistency, authors
    should avoid cultural or idiomatic references available only to
    English-speaking Americans (or any other specific culture or society). As
    much as possible, the language employed by Perl's core documentation should
    strive towards cultural universality, if not neutrality. Regional turns of
    phrase, examples drawing on popular-culture knowledge, and other rhetorical
    techniques of that nature should appear sparingly, if at all.</p>
<p class="Pp">Authors should feel free to let more freewheeling language
    flourish in &quot;second-order&quot; documentation about Perl, like books,
    blog entries, and magazine articles, published elsewhere and with a narrower
    readership in mind. But Perl's own docs should use language as accessible
    and welcoming to as wide an audience as possible.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Omit_placeholder_text_or_commentary"><a class="permalink" href="#Omit_placeholder_text_or_commentary">Omit
  placeholder text or commentary</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Placeholder text does not belong in the documentation that ships
    with Perl. No section header should be followed by text reading only
    &quot;Watch this space&quot;, &quot;To be included later&quot;, or the like.
    While Perl's source files may shift and alter as much as any other actively
    maintained technology, each released iteration of its technology should feel
    complete and self-contained, with no such future promises or other loose
    ends visible.</p>
<p class="Pp">Take advantage of Perl's regular release cycle. Instead of
    cluttering the docs with flags promising more information later--the
    presence of which do not help readers at all today--the documentation's
    maintenance team should treat any known documentation absences as an issue
    to address like any other in the Perl project. Let Perl's contributors,
    testers, and release engineers address that need, and resist the temptation
    to insert apologies, which have all the utility in documentation as
    undeleted debug messages do in production code.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Apply_section-breaks_and_examples_generously"><a class="permalink" href="#Apply_section-breaks_and_examples_generously">Apply
  section-breaks and examples generously</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">No matter how accessible their tone, the sight of monolithic
    blocks of text in technical documentation can present a will-weakening
    challenge for the reader. Authors can improve this situation through
    breaking long passages up into subsections with short, meaningful
  headers.</p>
<p class="Pp">Since every section-header in Pod also acts as a potential
    end-point for a cross-reference (made via Pod's
    <span class="Li">&quot;L&lt;...&gt;&quot;</span> syntax), putting plenty of
    subsections in your documentation lets other man pages more precisely link
    to a particular topic. This creates hyperlinks directly to the most
    appropriate section rather than to the whole page in general, and helps
    create a more cohesive sense of a rich, consistent, and interrelated manual
    for readers.</p>
<p class="Pp">Among the four documentation modes, sections belong more naturally
    in tutorials and explainers. The step-by-step instructions of cookbooks, or
    the austere definitions of reference pages, usually have no room for them.
    But authors can always make exceptions for unusually complex concepts that
    require further breakdown for clarity's sake.</p>
<p class="Pp">Example code, on the other hand, can be a welcome addition to any
    mode of documentation. Code blocks help break up a man page visually,
    reassuring the reader that no matter how deep the textual explanation gets,
    they are never far from another practical example showing how it all comes
    together using a small, easy-to-read snippet of tested Perl code.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Lead_with_common_cases_and_best_practices"><a class="permalink" href="#Lead_with_common_cases_and_best_practices">Lead
  with common cases and best practices</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Perl famously gives programmers more than one way to do things.
    Like any other long-lived programming language, Perl has also built up a
    large, community-held notion of best practices, blessing some ways to do
    things as better than others, usually for the sake of more maintainable
    code.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Show the better ways first</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Whenever it needs to show the rules for a technique which Perl
    provides many avenues for, the documentation should always lead with best
    practices. And when discussing some part of the Perl toolkit with many
    applications, the docs should begin with a demonstration of its application
    to the most common cases.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;open&quot;</span> function, for
    example, has myriad potential uses within Perl programs, but <i>most of the
    time</i> programmers--and especially those new to Perl--turn to this
    reference because they simply wish to open a file for reading or writing.
    For this reason, <span class="Li">&quot;open&quot;</span>'s documentation
    begins there, and only descends into the function's more obscure uses after
    thoroughly documenting and demonstrating how it works in the common case.
    Furthermore, while engaging in this demonstration, the
    <span class="Li">&quot;open&quot;</span> documentation does not burden the
    reader right away with detailed explanations about calling
    <span class="Li">&quot;open&quot;</span> via any route other than the
    best-practice, three-argument style.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Show the lesser ways when needed</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Sometimes, thoroughness demands documentation of deprecated
    techniques. For example, a certain Perl function might have an alternate
    syntax now considered outmoded and no longer best-practice, but which a
    maintainer of a legacy project might quite reasonably encounter when
    exploring old code. In this case, these features deserve documentation, but
    couched in clarity that modern Perl avoids such structures, and does not
    recommend their use in new projects.</p>
<p class="Pp">Another way to look at this philosophy (and one borrowed from our
    friends &lt;https://devguide.python.org/documenting/#affirmative-tone&gt; on
    Python's documentation team) involves writing while sympathizing with a
    programmer new to Perl, who may feel uncertain about learning a complex
    concept. By leading that concept's main documentation with clear, positive
    examples, we can immediately give these readers a simple and true picture of
    how it works in Perl, and boost their own confidence to start making use of
    this new knowledge. Certainly we should include alternate routes and
    admonitions as reasonably required, but we needn't emphasize them. Trust the
    reader to understand the basics quickly, and to keep reading for a deeper
    understanding if they feel so driven.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Document_Perl's_present"><a class="permalink" href="#Document_Perl's_present">Document
  Perl's present</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Perl's documentation should stay focused on Perl's present
    behavior, with a nod to future directions.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Recount the past only when necessary</i></p>
<p class="Pp">When some Perl feature changes its behavior, documentation about
    that feature should change too, and just as definitively. The docs have no
    obligation to keep descriptions of past behavior hanging around, even if
    attaching clauses like &quot;Prior to version 5.10, [...]&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">Since Perl's core documentation is part of Perl's source
    distribution, it enjoys the same benefits of versioning and version-control
    as the source code of Perl itself. Take advantage of this, and update the
    text boldly when needed. Perl's history remains safe, even when you delete
    or replace outdated information from the current version's docs.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl's docs can acknowledge or discuss former behavior when
    warranted, including notes that some feature appeared in the language as of
    some specific version number. Authors should consider applying principles
    similar to those for deprecated techniques, as described above: make the
    information present, but not prominent.</p>
<p class="Pp">Otherwise, keep the past in the past. A manual uncluttered with
    outdated instruction stays more succinct and relevant.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Describe the uncertain future with care</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Perl features marked as &quot;experimental&quot;--those that
    generate warnings when used in code not invoking the
    <span class="Li">&quot;experimental&quot;</span> pragma--deserve
    documentation, but only in certain contexts, and even then with caveats.
    These features represent possible new directions for Perl, but they have
    unstable interfaces and uncertain future presence.</p>
<p class="Pp">The documentation should take both implications of
    &quot;experimental&quot; literally. It should not discourage these features'
    use by programmers who wish to try out new features in projects that can
    risk their inherent instability; this experimentation can help Perl grow and
    improve. By the same token, the docs should downplay these features' use in
    just about every other context.</p>
<p class="Pp">Introductory or overview material should omit coverage of
    experimental features altogether.</p>
<p class="Pp">More thorough reference materials or explanatory articles can
    include experimental features, but needs to clearly mark them as such, and
    not treat them with the same prominence as Perl's stable features. Using
    unstable features seldom coincides with best practices, and documentation
    that puts best practices first should reflect this.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="The_documentation_speaks_with_one_voice"><a class="permalink" href="#The_documentation_speaks_with_one_voice">The
  documentation speaks with one voice</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Even though it comes from many hands and minds, criss-crossing
    through the many years of Perl's lifetime, the language's documentation
    should speak with a single, consistent voice. With few exceptions, the docs
    should avoid explicit first-person-singular statements, or similar
    self-reference to any individual's contributor's philosophies or
    experiences.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl did begin life as a deeply personal expression by a single
    individual, and this famously carried through the first revisions of its
    documentation as well. Today, Perl's community understands that the
    language's continued development and support comes from many people working
    in concert, rather than any one person's vision or effort. Its documentation
    should not pretend otherwise.</p>
<p class="Pp">The documentation should, however, carry forward the best
    tradition that Larry Wall set forth in the language's earliest days: Write
    both economically and with a humble, subtle wit, resulting in a technical
    manual that mixes concision with a friendly approachability. It avoids the
    dryness that one might expect from technical documentation, while not
    leaning so hard into overt comedy as to distract and confuse from the
    nonetheless-technical topics at hand.</p>
<p class="Pp">Like the best written works, Perl's documentation has a soul. Get
    familiar with it as a reader to internalize its voice, and then find your
    own way to express it in your own contributions. Writing clearly,
    succinctly, and with knowledge of your audience's expectations will get you
    most of the way there, in the meantime.</p>
<p class="Pp">Every line in the docs--whether English sentence or Perl
    statement--should serve the purpose of bringing understanding to the reader.
    Should a sentence exist mainly to make a wry joke that doesn't further the
    reader's knowledge of Perl, set it aside, and consider recasting it into a
    personal blog post or other article instead.</p>
<p class="Pp">Write with a light heart, and a miserly hand.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="INDEX_OF_PREFERRED_TERMS"><a class="permalink" href="#INDEX_OF_PREFERRED_TERMS">INDEX
  OF PREFERRED TERMS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">As noted above, this guide &quot;inherits&quot; all the preferred
    terms listed in the Chicago Manual of Style, 17th edition, and adds the
    following terms of particular interest to Perl documentation.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="built-in"><a class="permalink" href="#built-in">built-in
    function</a></dt>
  <dd>Not &quot;builtin&quot;.</dd>
  <dt id="Darwin"><a class="permalink" href="#Darwin">Darwin</a></dt>
  <dd>See macOS.</dd>
  <dt id="macOS"><a class="permalink" href="#macOS">macOS</a></dt>
  <dd>Use this term for Apple's operating system instead of &quot;Mac OS X&quot;
      or variants thereof.
    <p class="Pp">This term is also preferable to &quot;Darwin&quot;, unless one
        needs to refer to macOS's Unix layer specifically.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="man"><a class="permalink" href="#man">man page</a></dt>
  <dd>One unit of Unix-style documentation. Not &quot;manpage&quot;. Preferable
      to &quot;manual page&quot;.</dd>
  <dt id="Perl;"><a class="permalink" href="#Perl;">Perl; perl</a></dt>
  <dd>The name of the programming language is Perl, with a leading capital
      &quot;P&quot;, and the remainder in lowercase. (Never &quot;PERL&quot;.)
    <p class="Pp">The interpreter program that reads and executes Perl code is
        named &quot;<span class="Li">&quot;perl&quot;</span>&quot;, in lowercase
        and in monospace (as with any other command name).</p>
    <p class="Pp">Generally, unless you are specifically writing about the
        command-line <span class="Li">&quot;perl&quot;</span> program (as, for
        example, <span class="Li">&quot;perlrun&quot;</span> does), use
        &quot;Perl&quot; instead.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="Perl"><a class="permalink" href="#Perl">Perl 5</a></dt>
  <dd>Documentation need not follow Perl's name with a &quot;5&quot;, or any
      other number, except during discussions of Perl's history, future plans,
      or explicit comparisons between major Perl versions.
    <p class="Pp">Before 2019, specifying &quot;Perl 5&quot; was sometimes
        needed to distinguish the language from Perl 6. With the latter's
        renaming to &quot;Raku&quot;, this practice became unnecessary.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="Perl~2"><a class="permalink" href="#Perl~2">Perl 6</a></dt>
  <dd>See Raku.</dd>
  <dt id="Perl~3"><a class="permalink" href="#Perl~3">Perl 5 Porters, the;
    porters, the; p5p</a></dt>
  <dd>The full name of the team responsible for Perl's ongoing maintenance and
      development is &quot;the Perl 5 Porters&quot;, and this sobriquet should
      be spelled out in the first mention within any one document. It may
      thereafter call the team &quot;the porters&quot; or &quot;p5p&quot;.
    <p class="Pp">Not &quot;Perl5 Porters&quot;.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="program"><a class="permalink" href="#program">program</a></dt>
  <dd>The most general descriptor for a stand-alone work made out of executable
      Perl code. Synonymous with, and preferable to, &quot;script&quot;.</dd>
  <dt id="Raku"><a class="permalink" href="#Raku">Raku</a></dt>
  <dd>Perl's &quot;sister language&quot;, whose homepage is
      &lt;https://raku.org&gt;.
    <p class="Pp">Previously known as &quot;Perl 6&quot;. In 2019, its design
        team renamed the language to better reflect its identity as a project
        independent from Perl. As such, Perl's documentation should always refer
        to this language as &quot;Raku&quot; and not &quot;Perl 6&quot;.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="script"><a class="permalink" href="#script">script</a></dt>
  <dd>See program.</dd>
  <dt id="semicolon"><a class="permalink" href="#semicolon">semicolon</a></dt>
  <dd>Perl code's frequently overlooked punctuation mark. Not
      &quot;semi-colon&quot;.</dd>
  <dt id="Unix"><a class="permalink" href="#Unix">Unix</a></dt>
  <dd>Not &quot;UNIX&quot;, &quot;*nix&quot;, or &quot;Un*x&quot;. Applicable to
      both the original operating system from the 1970s as well as all its
      conceptual descendants. You may simply write &quot;Unix&quot; and not
      &quot;a Unix-like operating system&quot; when referring to a Unix-like
      operating system.</dd>
