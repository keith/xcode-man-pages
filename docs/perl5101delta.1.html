  statement changes</a></h2>
The handling of complex expressions by the
  <span class="Li">&quot;given&quot;</span>/<span class="Li">&quot;when&quot;</span>
  switch statement has been enhanced. There are two new cases where
  <span class="Li">&quot;when&quot;</span> now interprets its argument as a
  boolean, instead of an expression to be used in a smart match:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>flip-flop operators</dt>
  <dd>The <span class="Li">&quot;..&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;...&quot;</span> flip-flop operators are now
      evaluated in boolean context, following their usual semantics; see
      &quot;Range Operators&quot; in perlop.
    <p class="Pp">Note that, as in perl 5.10.0, <span class="Li">&quot;when
        (1..10)&quot;</span> will not work to test whether a given value is an
        integer between 1 and 10; you should use <span class="Li">&quot;when
        ([1..10])&quot;</span> instead (note the array reference).</p>
    <p class="Pp">However, contrary to 5.10.0, evaluating the flip-flop
        operators in boolean context ensures it can now be useful in a
        <span class="Li">&quot;when()&quot;</span>, notably for implementing
        bistable conditions, like in:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    when (/^=begin/ .. /^=end/) {
      # do something
    }
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>defined-or operator</dt>
  <dd>A compound expression involving the defined-or operator, as in
      <span class="Li">&quot;when (expr1 // expr2)&quot;</span>, will be treated
      as boolean if the first expression is boolean. (This just extends the
      existing rule that applies to the regular or operator, as in
      <span class="Li">&quot;when (expr1 || expr2)&quot;</span>.)</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The next section details more changes brought to the semantics to
    the smart match operator, that naturally also modify the behaviour of the
    switch statements where smart matching is implicitly used.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Smart_match_changes"><a class="permalink" href="#Smart_match_changes">Smart
  match changes</a></h2>
<i>Changes to type-based dispatch</i>
<p class="Pp">The smart match operator <span class="Li">&quot;~~&quot;</span> is
    no longer commutative. The behaviour of a smart match now depends primarily
    on the type of its right hand argument. Moreover, its semantics have been
    adjusted for greater consistency or usefulness in several cases. While the
    general backwards compatibility is maintained, several changes must be
    noted:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Code references with an empty prototype are no longer treated specially.
      They are passed an argument like the other code references (even if they
      choose to ignore it).</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;%hash ~~ sub {}&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;@array ~~ sub {}&quot;</span> now test that the
      subroutine returns a true value for each key of the hash (or element of
      the array), instead of passing the whole hash or array as a reference to
      the subroutine.</li>
  <li>Due to the commutativity breakage, code references are no longer treated
      specially when appearing on the left of the
      <span class="Li">&quot;~~&quot;</span> operator, but like any vulgar
      scalar.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;undef ~~ %hash&quot;</span> is always false (since
      <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> can't be a key in a hash). No
      implicit conversion to <span class="Li">&quot;&quot;</span> is done (as
      was the case in perl 5.10.0).</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;$scalar ~~ @array&quot;</span> now always
      distributes the smart match across the elements of the array. It's true if
      one element in <span class="Li">@array</span> verifies
      <span class="Li">&quot;$scalar ~~ $element&quot;</span>. This is a
      generalization of the old behaviour that tested whether the array
      contained the scalar.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">The full dispatch table for the smart match operator is given in
    &quot;Smart matching in detail&quot; in perlsyn.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Smart match and overloading</i></p>
<p class="Pp">According to the rule of dispatch based on the rightmost argument
    type, when an object overloading <span class="Li">&quot;~~&quot;</span>
    appears on the right side of the operator, the overload routine will always
    be called (with a 3rd argument set to a true value, see overload.) However,
    when the object will appear on the left, the overload routine will be called
    only when the rightmost argument is a simple scalar. This way distributivity
    of smart match across arrays is not broken, as well as the other behaviours
    with complex types (coderefs, hashes, regexes). Thus, writers of overloading
    routines for smart match mostly need to worry only with comparing against a
    scalar, and possibly with stringification overloading; the other common
    cases will be automatically handled consistently.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;~~&quot;</span> will now refuse to work on
    objects that do not overload it (in order to avoid relying on the object's
    underlying structure). (However, if the object overloads the stringification
    or the numification operators, and if overload fallback is active, it will
    be used instead, as usual.)</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Other_incompatible_changes"><a class="permalink" href="#Other_incompatible_changes">Other
  incompatible changes</a></h2>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>The semantics of <span class="Li">&quot;use feature :5.10*&quot;</span>
      have changed slightly. See &quot;Modules and Pragmata&quot; for more
      information.</li>
  <li>It is now a run-time error to use the smart match operator
      <span class="Li">&quot;~~&quot;</span> with an object that has no overload
      defined for it. (This way <span class="Li">&quot;~~&quot;</span> will not
      break encapsulation by matching against the object's internal
      representation as a reference.)</li>
  <li>The version control system used for the development of the perl
      interpreter has been switched from Perforce to git. This is mainly an
      internal issue that only affects people actively working on the perl core;
      but it may have minor external visibility, for example in some of details
      of the output of <span class="Li">&quot;perl -V&quot;</span>. See
      perlrepository for more information.</li>
  <li>The internal structure of the <span class="Li">&quot;ext/&quot;</span>
      directory in the perl source has been reorganised. In general, a module
      <span class="Li">&quot;Foo::Bar&quot;</span> whose source was stored under
      <i>ext/Foo/Bar/</i> is now located under <i>ext/Foo-Bar/</i>. Also, some
      modules have been moved from <i>lib/</i> to <i>ext/</i>. This is purely a
      source tarball change, and should make no difference to the compilation or
      installation of perl, unless you have a very customised build process that
      explicitly relies on this structure, or which hard-codes the
      <span class="Li">&quot;nonxs_ext&quot;</span> <i>Configure</i> parameter.
      Specifically, this change does not by default alter the location of any
      files in the final installation.</li>
  <li>As part of the <span class="Li">&quot;Test::Harness&quot;</span> 2.x to
      3.x upgrade, the experimental
      <span class="Li">&quot;Test::Harness::Straps&quot;</span> module has been
      removed. See &quot;Updated Modules&quot; for more details.</li>
  <li>As part of the <span class="Li">&quot;ExtUtils::MakeMaker&quot;</span>
      upgrade, the
      <span class="Li">&quot;ExtUtils::MakeMaker::bytes&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;ExtUtils::MakeMaker::vmsish&quot;</span> modules
      have been removed from this distribution.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;Module::CoreList&quot;</span> no longer contains
      the <span class="Li">%:patchlevel</span> hash.</li>
  <li>This one is actually a change introduced in 5.10.0, but it was missed from
      that release's perldelta, so it is mentioned here instead.
    <p class="Pp">A bugfix related to the handling of the
        <span class="Li">&quot;/m&quot;</span> modifier and
        <span class="Li">&quot;qr&quot;</span> resulted in a change of behaviour
        between 5.8.x and 5.10.0:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    # matches in 5.8.x, doesn't match in 5.10.0
    $re = qr/^bar/; &quot;foo\nbar&quot; =~ /$re/m;
    </pre>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Parallel_tests"><a class="permalink" href="#Parallel_tests">Parallel
  tests</a></h2>
The core distribution can now run its regression tests in parallel on Unix-like
  platforms. Instead of running <span class="Li">&quot;make test&quot;</span>,
  set <span class="Li">&quot;TEST_JOBS&quot;</span> in your environment to the
  number of tests to run in parallel, and run <span class="Li">&quot;make
  test_harness&quot;</span>. On a Bourne-like shell, this can be done as
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    TEST_JOBS=3 make test_harness  # Run 3 tests in parallel
</pre>
<p class="Pp">An environment variable is used, rather than parallel make itself,
    because TAP::Harness needs to be able to schedule individual non-conflicting
    test scripts itself, and there is no standard interface to
    <span class="Li">&quot;make&quot;</span> utilities to interact with their
    job schedulers.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that currently some test scripts may fail when run in
    parallel (most notably
    <span class="Li">&quot;ext/IO/t/io_dir.t&quot;</span>). If necessary run
    just the failing scripts again sequentially and see if the failures go
  away.</p>

The various large <span class="Li">&quot;Changes*&quot;</span> files (which

<p class="Pp">The file <i>Porting/patching.pod</i> has been deleted, as it

    is now obsolete. Information still relevant has been moved to

<h2 class="Ss" id="_fIext/_fP_reorganisation"><a class="permalink" href="#_fIext/_fP_reorganisation"><i>ext/</i>
  reorganisation</a></h2>
The layout of directories in <i>ext</i> has been revised. Specifically, all
  extensions are now flat, and at the top level, with
  <span class="Li">&quot;/&quot;</span> in pathnames replaced by
  <span class="Li">&quot;-&quot;</span>, so that <i>ext/Data/Dumper/</i> is now
  <i>ext/Data-Dumper/</i>, etc. The names of the extensions as specified to
  <i>Configure</i>, and as reported by <span class="Li">%Config::Config</span>
  under the keys <span class="Li">&quot;dynamic_ext&quot;</span>,
  <span class="Li">&quot;known_extensions&quot;</span>,
  <span class="Li">&quot;nonxs_ext&quot;</span> and
  <span class="Li">&quot;static_ext&quot;</span> have not changed, and still use
  <span class="Li">&quot;/&quot;</span>. Hence this change will not have any
  affect once perl is installed. However,
  <span class="Li">&quot;Attribute::Handlers&quot;</span>,
  <span class="Li">&quot;Safe&quot;</span> and
  <span class="Li">&quot;mro&quot;</span> have now become extensions in their
  own right, so if you run <i>Configure</i> with options to specify an exact
  list of extensions to build, you will need to change it to account for this.
<p class="Pp">For 5.10.2, it is planned that many dual-life modules will have
    been moved from <i>lib</i> to <i>ext</i>; again this will have no effect on
    an installed perl, but will matter if you invoke <i>Configure</i> with a
    pre-canned list of extensions to build.</p>

If <span class="Li">&quot;vendorlib&quot;</span> and
  <span class="Li">&quot;vendorarch&quot;</span> are the same, then they are
  only added to <span class="Li">@INC</span> once.
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">$Config{usedevel}</span> and the C-level
    <span class="Li">&quot;PERL_USE_DEVEL&quot;</span> are now defined if perl
    is built with <span class="Li">&quot;-Dusedevel&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Configure</i> will enable use of
    <span class="Li">&quot;-fstack-protector&quot;</span>, to provide protection
    against stack-smashing attacks, if the compiler supports it.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Configure</i> will now determine the correct prototypes for
    re-entrant functions, and for <span class="Li">&quot;gconvert&quot;</span>,
    if you are using a C++ compiler rather than a C compiler.</p>
<p class="Pp">On Unix, if you build from a tree containing a git repository, the
    configuration process will note the commit hash you have checked out, for
    display in the output of <span class="Li">&quot;perl -v&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;perl -V&quot;</span>. Unpushed local commits are
    automatically added to the list of local patches displayed by

  <li><span class="Li">&quot;crypt()&quot;</span> and string complement could
      return tainted values for untainted arguments [RT #59998].</li>
  <li>The <span class="Li">&quot;-i.suffix&quot;</span> command-line switch now
      recreates the file using restricted permissions, before changing its mode
      to match the original file. This eliminates a potential race condition [RT
      #60904].</li>
  <li>On some Unix systems, the value in <span class="Li">$?</span> would not
      have the top bit set (<span class="Li">&quot;$? &amp; 128&quot;</span>)
      even if the child core dumped.</li>
  <li>Under some circumstances, $^R could incorrectly become undefined [RT
      #57042].</li>
  <li>(XS) In various hash functions, passing a pre-computed hash to when the
      key is UTF-8 might result in an incorrect lookup.</li>
  <li>(XS) Including <i>XSUB.h</i> before <i>perl.h</i> gave a compile-time
      error [RT #57176].</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;$object-&gt;isa('Foo')&quot;</span> would report
      false if the package <span class="Li">&quot;Foo&quot;</span> didn't exist,
      even if the object's <span class="Li">@ISA</span> contained
      <span class="Li">&quot;Foo&quot;</span>.</li>
  <li>Various bugs in the new-to 5.10.0 mro code, triggered by manipulating
      <span class="Li">@ISA</span>, have been found and fixed.</li>
  <li>Bitwise operations on references could crash the interpreter, e.g.
      <span class="Li">&quot;$x=\$y; $x |= &quot;foo&quot;&quot;</span> [RT
      #54956].</li>
  <li>Patterns including alternation might be sensitive to the internal UTF-8
      representation, e.g.
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    my $byte = chr(192);
    my $utf8 = chr(192); utf8::upgrade($utf8);
    $utf8 =~ /$byte|X}/i;       # failed in 5.10.0
    </pre>
  </li>
  <li>Within UTF8-encoded Perl source files (i.e. where
      <span class="Li">&quot;use utf8&quot;</span> is in effect), double-quoted
      literal strings could be corrupted where a
      <span class="Li">&quot;\xNN&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;\0NNN&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;\N{}&quot;</span> is followed by a literal
      character with ordinal value greater than 255 [RT #59908].</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;B::Deparse&quot;</span> failed to correctly deparse
      various constructs: <span class="Li">&quot;readpipe STRING&quot;</span>
      [RT #62428], <span class="Li">&quot;CORE::require(STRING)&quot;</span> [RT
      #62488], <span class="Li">&quot;sub foo(_)&quot;</span> [RT #62484].</li>
  <li>Using <span class="Li">&quot;setpgrp()&quot;</span> with no arguments
      could corrupt the perl stack.</li>
  <li>The block form of <span class="Li">&quot;eval&quot;</span> is now
      specifically trappable by <span class="Li">&quot;Safe&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;ops&quot;</span>. Previously it was erroneously
      treated like string <span class="Li">&quot;eval&quot;</span>.</li>
  <li>In 5.10.0, the two characters <span class="Li">&quot;[~&quot;</span> were
      sometimes parsed as the smart match operator
      (<span class="Li">&quot;~~&quot;</span>) [RT #63854].</li>
  <li>In 5.10.0, the <span class="Li">&quot;*&quot;</span> quantifier in
      patterns was sometimes treated as
      <span class="Li">&quot;{0,32767}&quot;</span> [RT #60034, #60464]. For
      example, this match would fail:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    (&quot;ab&quot; x 32768) =~ /^(ab)*$/
    </pre>
  </li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;shmget&quot;</span> was limited to a 32 bit segment
      size on a 64 bit OS [RT #63924].</li>
  <li>Using <span class="Li">&quot;next&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;last&quot;</span> to exit a
      <span class="Li">&quot;given&quot;</span> block no longer produces a
      spurious warning like the following:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    Exiting given via last at foo.pl line 123
    </pre>
  </li>
  <li>On Windows, <span class="Li">'.\foo'</span> and
      <span class="Li">'..\foo'</span> were treated differently than
      <span class="Li">'./foo'</span> and <span class="Li">'../foo'</span> by
      <span class="Li">&quot;do&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;require&quot;</span> [RT #63492].</li>
  <li>Assigning a format to a glob could corrupt the format; e.g.:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
     *bar=*foo{FORMAT}; # foo format now bad
    </pre>
  </li>
  <li>Attempting to coerce a typeglob to a string or number could cause an
      assertion failure. The correct error message is now generated,
      <span class="Li">&quot;Can't coerce GLOB to
      </span><i>$type</i><span class="Li">&quot;</span>.</li>
  <li>Under <span class="Li">&quot;use filetest 'access'&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;-x&quot;</span> was using the wrong access mode.
      This has been fixed [RT #49003].</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;length&quot;</span> on a tied scalar that returned
      a Unicode value would not be correct the first time. This has been
    fixed.</li>
  <li>Using an array <span class="Li">&quot;tie&quot;</span> inside in array
      <span class="Li">&quot;tie&quot;</span> could SEGV. This has been fixed.
      [RT #51636]</li>
  <li>A race condition inside
      <span class="Li">&quot;PerlIOStdio_close()&quot;</span> has been
      identified and fixed. This used to cause various threading issues,
      including SEGVs.</li>
  <li>In <span class="Li">&quot;unpack&quot;</span>, the use of
      <span class="Li">&quot;()&quot;</span> groups in scalar context was
      internally placing a list on the interpreter's stack, which manifested in
      various ways, including SEGVs. This is now fixed [RT #50256].</li>
  <li>Magic was called twice in <span class="Li">&quot;substr&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;\&amp;$x&quot;</span>, <span class="Li">&quot;tie
      $x, $m&quot;</span> and <span class="Li">&quot;chop&quot;</span>. These
      have all been fixed.</li>
  <li>A 5.10.0 optimisation to clear the temporary stack within the implicit
      loop of <span class="Li">&quot;s///ge&quot;</span> has been reverted, as
      it turned out to be the cause of obscure bugs in seemingly unrelated parts
      of the interpreter [commit ef0d4e17921ee3de].</li>
  <li>The line numbers for warnings inside
      <span class="Li">&quot;elsif&quot;</span> are now correct.</li>
  <li>The <span class="Li">&quot;..&quot;</span> operator now works correctly
      with ranges whose ends are at or close to the values of the smallest and
      largest integers.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;binmode STDIN, ':raw'&quot;</span> could lead to
      segmentation faults on some platforms. This has been fixed [RT
    #54828].</li>
  <li>An off-by-one error meant that <span class="Li">&quot;index $str,
      ...&quot;</span> was effectively being executed as
      <span class="Li">&quot;index &quot;$str\0&quot;, ...&quot;</span>. This
      has been fixed [RT #53746].</li>
  <li>Various leaks associated with named captures in regexes have been fixed
      [RT #57024].</li>
  <li>A weak reference to a hash would leak. This was affecting
      <span class="Li">&quot;DBI&quot;</span> [RT #56908].</li>
  <li>Using (?|) in a regex could cause a segfault [RT #59734].</li>
  <li>Use of a UTF-8 <span class="Li">&quot;tr//&quot;</span> within a closure
      could cause a segfault [RT #61520].</li>
  <li>Calling <span class="Li">&quot;sv_chop()&quot;</span> or otherwise
      upgrading an SV could result in an unaligned 64-bit access on the SPARC
      architecture [RT #60574].</li>
  <li>In the 5.10.0 release,
      <span class="Li">&quot;inc_version_list&quot;</span> would incorrectly
      list <span class="Li">&quot;5.10.*&quot;</span> after
      <span class="Li">&quot;5.8.*&quot;</span>; this affected the
      <span class="Li">@INC</span> search order [RT #67628].</li>
  <li>In 5.10.0, <span class="Li">&quot;pack &quot;a*&quot;,
      $tainted_value&quot;</span> returned a non-tainted value [RT #52552].</li>
  <li>In 5.10.0, <span class="Li">&quot;printf&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;sprintf&quot;</span> could produce the fatal error
      <span class="Li">&quot;panic: utf8_mg_pos_cache_update&quot;</span> when
      printing UTF-8 strings [RT #62666].</li>
  <li>In the 5.10.0 release, a dynamically created
      <span class="Li">&quot;AUTOLOAD&quot;</span> method might be missed
      (method cache issue) [RT #60220,60232].</li>
  <li>In the 5.10.0 release, a combination of <span class="Li">&quot;use
      feature&quot;</span> and <span class="Li">&quot;//ee&quot;</span> could
      cause a memory leak [RT #63110].</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;-C&quot;</span> on the shebang
      (<span class="Li">&quot;#!&quot;</span>) line is once more permitted if it
      is also specified on the command line.
      <span class="Li">&quot;-C&quot;</span> on the shebang line used to be a
      silent no-op <i>if</i> it was not also on the command line, so perl 5.10.0
      disallowed it, which broke some scripts. Now perl checks whether it is
      also on the command line and only dies if it is not [RT #67880].</li>
  <li>In 5.10.0, certain types of re-entrant regular expression could crash, or
      cause the following assertion failure [RT #60508]:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    Assertion rx-&gt;sublen &gt;= (s - rx-&gt;subbeg) + i failed

This is a list of some significant unfixed bugs, which are regressions from
  either 5.10.0 or 5.8.x.
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;List::Util::first&quot;</span> misbehaves in the

      <span class="Li">&quot;my $_&quot;</span> or implicitly by
      <span class="Li">&quot;given&quot;</span>). The variable which gets set
      for each iteration is the package variable <span class="Li">$_</span>, not
      the lexical <span class="Li">$_</span> [RT #67694].
    <p class="Pp">A similar issue may occur in other modules that provide

    <p class="Pp">A workaround is to generate the character outside of the
        regex:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    my $a = &quot;\N{THAI CHARACTER SARA I}&quot;;
    my $r1 = qr/$a/;
    </pre>
  </li>
  <li>Some regexes may run much more slowly when run in a child thread compared
      with the thread the pattern was compiled into [RT #55600].</li>

The following items are now deprecated.
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;Switch&quot;</span> is buggy and should be avoided.
      From perl 5.11.0 onwards, it is intended that any use of the core version
      of this module will emit a warning, and that the module will eventually be
      removed from the core (probably in perl 5.14.0). See &quot;Switch
      statements&quot; in perlsyn for its replacement.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;suidperl&quot;</span> will be removed in 5.12.0.
      This provides a mechanism to emulate setuid permission bits on systems
      that don't support it properly.</li>

Some of the work in this release was funded by a TPF grant.
<p class="Pp">Nicholas Clark officially retired from maintenance pumpking duty
    at the end of 2008; however in reality he has put much effort in since then
    to help get 5.10.1 into a fit state to be released, including writing a
    considerable chunk of this perldelta.</p>
<p class="Pp">Steffen Mueller and David Golden in particular helped getting CPAN
    modules polished and synchronised with their in-core equivalents.</p>
<p class="Pp">Craig Berry was tireless in getting maint to run under VMS, no
    matter how many times we broke it for him.</p>
<p class="Pp">The other core committers contributed most of the changes, and
    applied most of the patches sent in by the hundreds of contributors listed
    in <i>AUTHORS</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">(Sorry to all the people I haven't mentioned by name).</p>
<p class="Pp">Finally, thanks to Larry Wall, without whom none of this would be
    necessary.</p>

  Bugs</a></h1>
If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
  posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
  http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ . There may also be information at
  http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.
<p class="Pp">If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the
    <b>perlbug</b> program included with your release. Be sure to trim your bug
    down to a tiny but sufficient test case. Your bug report, along with the
    output of <span class="Li">&quot;perl -V&quot;</span>, will be sent off to
    perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make
    it inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please
    send it to perl5-security-report@perl.org. This points to a closed
    subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core
    committers, who will be able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out
    a resolution, and help co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix
    the problem across all platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use
    this address for security issues in the Perl core, not for modules
    independently distributed on CPAN.</p>
