The <code class="Nm">db_archive</code> utility writes the pathnames of log files
  that are no longer in use (for example, no longer involved in active
  transactions), to the standard output, one pathname per line. These log files
  should be written to backup media to provide for recovery in the case of
  catastrophic failure (which also requires a snapshot of the database files),
  but they may then be deleted from the system to reclaim disk space.
<p class="Pp">The options are as follows:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><a class="permalink" href="#a"><code class="Fl" id="a">-a</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Write all pathnames as absolute pathnames, instead of relative to the
      database home directories.</dd>
  <dt><a class="permalink" href="#d"><code class="Fl" id="d">-d</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Remove log files that are no longer needed; no filenames are written.
      Automatic log file removal is likely to make catastrophic recovery
      impossible.</dd>
  <dt><a class="permalink" href="#h"><code class="Fl" id="h">-h</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Specify a home directory for the database environment; by default, the
      current working directory is used.</dd>
  <dt><a class="permalink" href="#l"><code class="Fl" id="l">-l</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Write out the pathnames of all the database log files, whether or not they
      are involved in active transactions.</dd>
  <dt><a class="permalink" href="#P"><code class="Fl" id="P">-P</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Specify an environment password. Although Berkeley DB utilities overwrite
      password strings as soon as possible, be aware there may be a window of
      vulnerability on systems where unprivileged users can see command-line
      arguments or where utilities are not able to overwrite the memory
      containing the command-line arguments.</dd>
  <dt><a class="permalink" href="#s"><code class="Fl" id="s">-s</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Write the pathnames of all the database files that need to be archived in
      order to recover the database from catastrophic failure. If any of the
      database files have not been accessed during the lifetime of the current
      log files, db_archive will not include them in this output.
    <p class="Pp">It is possible that some of the files to which the log refers
        have since been deleted from the system. In this case, db_archive will
        ignore them. When db_recover is run, any files to which the log refers
        that are not present during recovery are assumed to have been deleted
        and will not be recovered.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><a class="permalink" href="#V"><code class="Fl" id="V">-V</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Write the library version number to the standard output, and exit.</dd>
  <dt><a class="permalink" href="#v"><code class="Fl" id="v">-v</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Run in verbose mode, listing the checkpoints in the log files as they are
      reviewed.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Log cursor handles (returned by the DB_ENV-&gt;log_cursor method)
    may have open file descriptors for log files in the database environment.
    Also, the Berkeley DB interfaces to the database environment logging
    subsystem (for example, DB_ENV-&gt;log_put and DB_TXN-&gt;abort) may
    allocate log cursors and have open file descriptors for log files as well.
    On operating systems where filesystem related system calls (for example,
    rename and unlink on Windows/NT) can fail if a process has an open file
    descriptor for the affected file, attempting to move or remove the log files
    listed by db_archive may fail. All Berkeley DB internal use of log cursors
    operates on active log files only and furthermore, is short-lived in nature.
    So, an application seeing such a failure should be restructured to close any
    open log cursors it may have, and otherwise to retry the operation until it
    succeeds. (Although the latter is not likely to be necessary; it is hard to
    imagine a reason to move or rename a log file in which transactions are
    being logged or aborted.)</p>
<p class="Pp">The db_archive utility uses a Berkeley DB environment (as
    described for the -h option, the environment variable DB_HOME, or because
    the utility was run in a directory containing a Berkeley DB environment). In
    order to avoid environment corruption when using a Berkeley DB environment,
    db_archive should always be given the chance to detach from the environment
    and exit gracefully. To cause db_archive to release all environment
    resources and exit cleanly, send it an interrupt signal (SIGINT).</p>
<p class="Pp">The DB_ENV-&gt;log_archive method is the underlying method used by
    the db_archive utility. See the db_archive utility source code for an
    example of using DB_ENV-&gt;log_archive in a IEEE/ANSI Std 1003.1 (POSIX)
    environment.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <code class="Nm">db_archive</code> utility exits 0 on success,
    and &gt;0 if an error occurs.</p>
