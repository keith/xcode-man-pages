  set of digits in the Common script are legal in a script run of another
  script</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">There are several sets of digits in the Common script.
    <span class="Li">&quot;[0-9]&quot;</span> is the most familiar. But there
    are also <span class="Li">&quot;[\x{FF10}-\x{FF19}]&quot;</span> (FULLWIDTH
    DIGIT ZERO - FULLWIDTH DIGIT NINE), and several sets for use in mathematical
    notation, such as the MATHEMATICAL DOUBLE-STRUCK DIGITs. Any of these sets
    should be able to appear in script runs of, say, Greek. But the previous
    design overlooked all but the ASCII digits
    <span class="Li">&quot;[0-9]&quot;</span>, so the design was flawed. This
    has been fixed, so is both a bug fix and an incompatibility.</p>
<p class="Pp">All digits in a run still have to come from the same set of ten
    digits.</p>

  <dd>The Windows Server 2003 SP1 Platform SDK build, with its early x64
      compiler and tools, was accidentally broken in Perl 5.27.9. This has now
      been fixed.</dd>

  <dd>Perl's build and testing process on Mac OS X for
      <span class="Li">&quot;-Duseshrplib&quot;</span> builds is now compatible
      with Mac OS X System Integrity Protection (SIP).
    <p class="Pp">SIP prevents binaries in <i>/bin</i> (and a few other places)
        being passed the <span class="Li">&quot;DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH&quot;</span>
        environment variable. For our purposes this prevents
        <span class="Li">&quot;DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH&quot;</span> from being passed
        to the shell, which prevents that variable being passed to the testing
        or build process, so running <span class="Li">&quot;perl&quot;</span>
        couldn't find <i>libperl.dylib</i>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">To work around that, the initial build of the <i>perl</i>
        executable expects to find <i>libperl.dylib</i> in the build directory,
        and the library path is then adjusted during installation to point to
        the installed library.</p>

  <li>If an in-place edit is still in progress during global destruction and the
      process exit code (as stored in <span class="Li">$?</span>) is zero, perl
      will now treat the in-place edit as successful, replacing the input file
      with any output produced.
    <p class="Pp">This allows code like:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>  perl -i -ne 'print &quot;Foo&quot;; last'
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">to replace the input file, while code like:</p>

<p class="Pp">Perl 5.28.2 represents approximately 4 months of development since
    Perl 5.28.1 and contains approximately 2,500 lines of changes across 75
    files from 13 authors.</p>
<p class="Pp">Excluding auto-generated files, documentation and release tools,
    there were approximately 1,200 lines of changes to 29 .pm, .t, .c and .h
    files.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl continues to flourish into its fourth decade thanks to a
    vibrant community of users and developers. The following people are known to
    have contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.28.2:</p>
<p class="Pp">Aaron Crane, Abigail, Andy Dougherty, David Mitchell, Karen
    Etheridge, Karl Williamson, Leon Timmermans, Nicolas R., Sawyer X, Steve
    Hay, Tina Mueller, Tony Cook, Zak B. Elep.</p>
<p class="Pp">The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is
    automatically generated from version control history. In particular, it does
    not include the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who
    reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.</p>
<p class="Pp">Many of the changes included in this version originated in the
    CPAN modules included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire CPAN
    community for helping Perl to flourish.</p>
