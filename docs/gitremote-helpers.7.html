Remote helper programs are normally not used directly by end users, but they are
  invoked by Git when it needs to interact with remote repositories Git does not
  support natively. A given helper will implement a subset of the capabilities
  documented here. When Git needs to interact with a repository using a remote
  helper, it spawns the helper as an independent process, sends commands to the
  helper&#x2019;s standard input, and expects results from the helper&#x2019;s
  standard output. Because a remote helper runs as an independent process from
  Git, there is no need to re-link Git to add a new helper, nor any need to link
  the helper with the implementation of Git.
<p class="Pp">Every helper must support the &quot;capabilities&quot; command,
    which Git uses to determine what other commands the helper will accept.
    Those other commands can be used to discover and update remote refs,
    transport objects between the object database and the remote repository, and
    update the local object store.</p>
<p class="Pp">Git comes with a &quot;curl&quot; family of remote helpers, that
    handle various transport protocols, such as <i>git-remote-http</i>,
    <i>git-remote-https</i>, <i>git-remote-ftp</i> and <i>git-remote-ftps</i>.
    They implement the capabilities <i>fetch</i>, <i>option</i>, and
    <i>push</i>.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="INVOCATION"><a class="permalink" href="#INVOCATION">INVOCATION</a></h1>
Remote helper programs are invoked with one or (optionally) two arguments. The
  first argument specifies a remote repository as in Git; it is either the name
  of a configured remote or a URL. The second argument specifies a URL; it is
  usually of the form <i>&lt;transport&gt;://&lt;address&gt;</i>, but any
  arbitrary string is possible. The <b>GIT_DIR</b> environment variable is set
  up for the remote helper and can be used to determine where to store
  additional data or from which directory to invoke auxiliary Git commands.
<p class="Pp">When Git encounters a URL of the form
    <i>&lt;transport&gt;://&lt;address&gt;</i>, where <i>&lt;transport&gt;</i>
    is a protocol that it cannot handle natively, it automatically invokes
    <i>git remote-&lt;transport&gt;</i> with the full URL as the second
    argument. If such a URL is encountered directly on the command line, the
    first argument is the same as the second, and if it is encountered in a
    configured remote, the first argument is the name of that remote.</p>
<p class="Pp">A URL of the form <i>&lt;transport&gt;::&lt;address&gt;</i>
    explicitly instructs Git to invoke <i>git remote-&lt;transport&gt;</i> with
    <i>&lt;address&gt;</i> as the second argument. If such a URL is encountered
    directly on the command line, the first argument is <i>&lt;address&gt;</i>,
    and if it is encountered in a configured remote, the first argument is the
    name of that remote.</p>
<p class="Pp">Additionally, when a configured remote has
    <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.vcs</b> set to <i>&lt;transport&gt;</i>, Git
    explicitly invokes <i>git remote-&lt;transport&gt;</i> with
    <i>&lt;name&gt;</i> as the first argument. If set, the second argument is
    <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.url</b>; otherwise, the second argument is
  omitted.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="INPUT_FORMAT"><a class="permalink" href="#INPUT_FORMAT">INPUT
  FORMAT</a></h1>
Git sends the remote helper a list of commands on standard input, one per line.
  The first command is always the <i>capabilities</i> command, in response to
  which the remote helper must print a list of the capabilities it supports (see
  below) followed by a blank line. The response to the capabilities command
  determines what commands Git uses in the remainder of the command stream.
<p class="Pp">The command stream is terminated by a blank line. In some cases
    (indicated in the documentation of the relevant commands), this blank line
    is followed by a payload in some other protocol (e.g., the pack protocol),
    while in others it indicates the end of input.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Capabilities"><a class="permalink" href="#Capabilities">Capabilities</a></h2>
Each remote helper is expected to support only a subset of commands. The
  operations a helper supports are declared to Git in the response to the
  <b>capabilities</b> command (see COMMANDS, below).
<p class="Pp">In the following, we list all defined capabilities and for each we
    list which commands a helper with that capability must provide.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Capabilities for Pushing</b>
  <br/>
</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp"><i>connect</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Can attempt to connect to <i>git receive-pack</i> (for
  pushing), <i>git upload-pack</i>, etc for communication using git&#x2019;s
  native packfile protocol. This requires a bidirectional, full-duplex
  connection.
<p class="Pp">Supported commands: <i>connect</i>.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>stateless-connect</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Experimental; for internal use only. Can attempt to
  connect to a remote server for communication using git&#x2019;s wire-protocol
  version 2. See the documentation for the stateless-connect command for more
  information.
<p class="Pp">Supported commands: <i>stateless-connect</i>.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>push</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Can discover remote refs and push local commits and the
  history leading up to them to new or existing remote refs.
<p class="Pp">Supported commands: <i>list for-push</i>, <i>push</i>.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>export</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Can discover remote refs and push specified objects from
  a fast-import stream to remote refs.
<p class="Pp">Supported commands: <i>list for-push</i>, <i>export</i>.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">If a helper advertises <i>connect</i>, Git will use it if possible
    and fall back to another capability if the helper requests so when
    connecting (see the <i>connect</i> command under COMMANDS). When choosing
    between <i>push</i> and <i>export</i>, Git prefers <i>push</i>. Other
    frontends may have some other order of preference.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>no-private-update</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When using the <i>refspec</i> capability, git normally
  updates the private ref on successful push. This update is disabled when the
  remote-helper declares the capability <i>no-private-update</i>.</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>Capabilities for Fetching</b>
  <br/>
</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp"><i>connect</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Can try to connect to <i>git upload-pack</i> (for
  fetching), <i>git receive-pack</i>, etc for communication using the
  Git&#x2019;s native packfile protocol. This requires a bidirectional,
  full-duplex connection.
<p class="Pp">Supported commands: <i>connect</i>.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>stateless-connect</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Experimental; for internal use only. Can attempt to
  connect to a remote server for communication using git&#x2019;s wire-protocol
  version 2. See the documentation for the stateless-connect command for more
  information.
<p class="Pp">Supported commands: <i>stateless-connect</i>.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>fetch</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Can discover remote refs and transfer objects reachable
  from them to the local object store.
<p class="Pp">Supported commands: <i>list</i>, <i>fetch</i>.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>import</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Can discover remote refs and output objects reachable
  from them as a stream in fast-import format.
<p class="Pp">Supported commands: <i>list</i>, <i>import</i>.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>check-connectivity</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Can guarantee that when a clone is requested, the
  received pack is self contained and is connected.</div>
<p class="Pp">If a helper advertises <i>connect</i>, Git will use it if possible
    and fall back to another capability if the helper requests so when
    connecting (see the <i>connect</i> command under COMMANDS). When choosing
    between <i>fetch</i> and <i>import</i>, Git prefers <i>fetch</i>. Other
    frontends may have some other order of preference.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>Miscellaneous capabilities</b>
  <br/>
</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp"><i>option</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">For specifying settings like <b>verbosity</b> (how much
  output to write to stderr) and <b>depth</b> (how much history is wanted in the
  case of a shallow clone) that affect how other commands are carried out.</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>refspec</i> &lt;refspec&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">For remote helpers that implement <i>import</i> or
  <i>export</i>, this capability allows the refs to be constrained to a private
  namespace, instead of writing to refs/heads or refs/remotes directly. It is
  recommended that all importers providing the <i>import</i> capability use
  this. It&#x2019;s mandatory for <i>export</i>.
<p class="Pp">A helper advertising the capability <b>refspec
    refs/heads/*:refs/svn/origin/branches/*</b> is saying that, when it is asked
    to <b>import refs/heads/topic</b>, the stream it outputs will update the
    <b>refs/svn/origin/branches/topic</b> ref.</p>
<p class="Pp">This capability can be advertised multiple times. The first
    applicable refspec takes precedence. The left-hand of refspecs advertised
    with this capability must cover all refs reported by the list command. If no
    <i>refspec</i> capability is advertised, there is an implied <b>refspec
    *:*</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">When writing remote-helpers for decentralized version control
    systems, it is advised to keep a local copy of the repository to interact
    with, and to let the private namespace refs point to this local repository,
    while the refs/remotes namespace is used to track the remote repository.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>bidi-import</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This modifies the <i>import</i> capability. The
  fast-import commands <i>cat-blob</i> and <i>ls</i> can be used by
  remote-helpers to retrieve information about blobs and trees that already
  exist in fast-import&#x2019;s memory. This requires a channel from fast-import
  to the remote-helper. If it is advertised in addition to &quot;import&quot;,
  Git establishes a pipe from fast-import to the remote-helper&#x2019;s stdin.
  It follows that Git and fast-import are both connected to the
  remote-helper&#x2019;s stdin. Because Git can send multiple commands to the
  remote-helper it is required that helpers that use <i>bidi-import</i> buffer
  all <i>import</i> commands of a batch before sending data to fast-import. This
  is to prevent mixing commands and fast-import responses on the helper&#x2019;s
  stdin.</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>export-marks</i> &lt;file&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This modifies the <i>export</i> capability, instructing
  Git to dump the internal marks table to &lt;file&gt; when complete. For
  details, read up on <b>--export-marks=&lt;file&gt;</b> in
  <b>git-fast-export</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>import-marks</i> &lt;file&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This modifies the <i>export</i> capability, instructing
  Git to load the marks specified in &lt;file&gt; before processing any input.
  For details, read up on <b>--import-marks=&lt;file&gt;</b> in
  <b>git-fast-export</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>signed-tags</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This modifies the <i>export</i> capability, instructing
  Git to pass <b>--signed-tags=verbatim</b> to <b>git-fast-export</b>(1). In the
  absence of this capability, Git will use
  <b>--signed-tags=warn-strip</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>object-format</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This indicates that the helper is able to interact with
  the remote side using an explicit hash algorithm extension.</div>
</div>
</section>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="COMMANDS"><a class="permalink" href="#COMMANDS">COMMANDS</a></h1>
Commands are given by the caller on the helper&#x2019;s standard input, one per
  line.
<p class="Pp"><i>capabilities</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Lists the capabilities of the helper, one per line,
  ending with a blank line. Each capability may be preceded with <i>*</i>, which
  marks them mandatory for Git versions using the remote helper to understand.
  Any unknown mandatory capability is a fatal error.
<p class="Pp">Support for this command is mandatory.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>list</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Lists the refs, one per line, in the format
  &quot;&lt;value&gt; &lt;name&gt; [&lt;attr&gt; ...]&quot;. The value may be a
  hex sha1 hash, &quot;@&lt;dest&gt;&quot; for a symref, &quot;:&lt;keyword&gt;
  &lt;value&gt;&quot; for a key-value pair, or &quot;?&quot; to indicate that
  the helper could not get the value of the ref. A space-separated list of
  attributes follows the name; unrecognized attributes are ignored. The list
  ends with a blank line.
<p class="Pp">See REF LIST ATTRIBUTES for a list of currently defined
    attributes. See REF LIST KEYWORDS for a list of currently defined
  keywords.</p>
<p class="Pp">Supported if the helper has the &quot;fetch&quot; or
    &quot;import&quot; capability.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>list for-push</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Similar to <i>list</i>, except that it is used if and
  only if the caller wants to the resulting ref list to prepare push commands. A
  helper supporting both push and fetch can use this to distinguish for which
  operation the output of <i>list</i> is going to be used, possibly reducing the
  amount of work that needs to be performed.
<p class="Pp">Supported if the helper has the &quot;push&quot; or
    &quot;export&quot; capability.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>option</i> &lt;name&gt; &lt;value&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Sets the transport helper option &lt;name&gt; to
  &lt;value&gt;. Outputs a single line containing one of <i>ok</i> (option
  successfully set), <i>unsupported</i> (option not recognized) or <i>error
  &lt;msg&gt;</i> (option &lt;name&gt; is supported but &lt;value&gt; is not
  valid for it). Options should be set before other commands, and may influence
  the behavior of those commands.
<p class="Pp">See OPTIONS for a list of currently defined options.</p>
<p class="Pp">Supported if the helper has the &quot;option&quot; capability.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>fetch</i> &lt;sha1&gt; &lt;name&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Fetches the given object, writing the necessary objects
  to the database. Fetch commands are sent in a batch, one per line, terminated
  with a blank line. Outputs a single blank line when all fetch commands in the
  same batch are complete. Only objects which were reported in the output of
  <i>list</i> with a sha1 may be fetched this way.
<p class="Pp">Optionally may output a <i>lock &lt;file&gt;</i> line indicating
    the full path of a file under <b>$GIT_DIR/objects/pack</b> which is keeping
    a pack until refs can be suitably updated. The path must end with
    <b>.keep</b>. This is a mechanism to name a &lt;pack,idx,keep&gt; tuple by
    giving only the keep component. The kept pack will not be deleted by a
    concurrent repack, even though its objects may not be referenced until the
    fetch completes. The <b>.keep</b> file will be deleted at the conclusion of
    the fetch.</p>
<p class="Pp">If option <i>check-connectivity</i> is requested, the helper must
    output <i>connectivity-ok</i> if the clone is self-contained and
  connected.</p>
<p class="Pp">Supported if the helper has the &quot;fetch&quot; capability.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>push</i> +&lt;src&gt;:&lt;dst&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Pushes the given local &lt;src&gt; commit or branch to
  the remote branch described by &lt;dst&gt;. A batch sequence of one or more
  <i>push</i> commands is terminated with a blank line (if there is only one
  reference to push, a single <i>push</i> command is followed by a blank line).
  For example, the following would be two batches of <i>push</i>, the first
  asking the remote-helper to push the local ref <i>master</i> to the remote ref
  <i>master</i> and the local <b>HEAD</b> to the remote <i>branch</i>, and the
  second asking to push ref <i>foo</i> to ref <i>bar</i> (forced update
  requested by the <i>+</i>).
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
push refs/heads/master:refs/heads/master
push HEAD:refs/heads/branch
\n
push +refs/heads/foo:refs/heads/bar
\n
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Zero or more protocol options may be entered after the last
    <i>push</i> command, before the batch&#x2019;s terminating blank line.</p>
<p class="Pp">When the push is complete, outputs one or more <i>ok
    &lt;dst&gt;</i> or <i>error &lt;dst&gt; &lt;why&gt;?</i> lines to indicate
    success or failure of each pushed ref. The status report output is
    terminated by a blank line. The option field &lt;why&gt; may be quoted in a
    C style string if it contains an LF.</p>
<p class="Pp">Supported if the helper has the &quot;push&quot; capability.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>import</i> &lt;name&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Produces a fast-import stream which imports the current
  value of the named ref. It may additionally import other refs as needed to
  construct the history efficiently. The script writes to a helper-specific
  private namespace. The value of the named ref should be written to a location
  in this namespace derived by applying the refspecs from the
  &quot;refspec&quot; capability to the name of the ref.
<p class="Pp">Especially useful for interoperability with a foreign versioning
    system.</p>
<p class="Pp">Just like <i>push</i>, a batch sequence of one or more
    <i>import</i> is terminated with a blank line. For each batch of
    <i>import</i>, the remote helper should produce a fast-import stream
    terminated by a <i>done</i> command.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that if the <i>bidi-import</i> capability is used the
    complete batch sequence has to be buffered before starting to send data to
    fast-import to prevent mixing of commands and fast-import responses on the
    helper&#x2019;s stdin.</p>
<p class="Pp">Supported if the helper has the &quot;import&quot; capability.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>export</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Instructs the remote helper that any subsequent input is
  part of a fast-import stream (generated by <i>git fast-export</i>) containing
  objects which should be pushed to the remote.
<p class="Pp">Especially useful for interoperability with a foreign versioning
    system.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>export-marks</i> and <i>import-marks</i> capabilities, if
    specified, affect this command in so far as they are passed on to <i>git
    fast-export</i>, which then will load/store a table of marks for local
    objects. This can be used to implement for incremental operations.</p>
<p class="Pp">Supported if the helper has the &quot;export&quot; capability.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>connect</i> &lt;service&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Connects to given service. Standard input and standard
  output of helper are connected to specified service (git prefix is included in
  service name so e.g. fetching uses <i>git-upload-pack</i> as service) on
  remote side. Valid replies to this command are empty line (connection
  established), <i>fallback</i> (no smart transport support, fall back to dumb
  transports) and just exiting with error message printed (can&#x2019;t connect,
  don&#x2019;t bother trying to fall back). After line feed terminating the
  positive (empty) response, the output of service starts. After the connection
  ends, the remote helper exits.
<p class="Pp">Supported if the helper has the &quot;connect&quot;
  capability.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>stateless-connect</i> &lt;service&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Experimental; for internal use only. Connects to the
  given remote service for communication using git&#x2019;s wire-protocol
  version 2. Valid replies to this command are empty line (connection
  established), <i>fallback</i> (no smart transport support, fall back to dumb
  transports) and just exiting with error message printed (can&#x2019;t connect,
  don&#x2019;t bother trying to fall back). After line feed terminating the
  positive (empty) response, the output of the service starts. Messages (both
  request and response) must consist of zero or more PKT-LINEs, terminating in a
  flush packet. Response messages will then have a response end packet after the
  flush packet to indicate the end of a response. The client must not expect the
  server to store any state in between request-response pairs. After the
  connection ends, the remote helper exits.
<p class="Pp">Supported if the helper has the &quot;stateless-connect&quot;
    capability.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">If a fatal error occurs, the program writes the error message to
    stderr and exits. The caller should expect that a suitable error message has
    been printed if the child closes the connection without completing a valid
    response for the current command.</p>
<p class="Pp">Additional commands may be supported, as may be determined from
    capabilities reported by the helper.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="REF_LIST_ATTRIBUTES"><a class="permalink" href="#REF_LIST_ATTRIBUTES">REF
  LIST ATTRIBUTES</a></h1>
The <i>list</i> command produces a list of refs in which each ref may be
  followed by a list of attributes. The following ref list attributes are
  defined.
<p class="Pp"><i>unchanged</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This ref is unchanged since the last import or fetch,
  although the helper cannot necessarily determine what value that
  produced.</div>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="REF_LIST_KEYWORDS"><a class="permalink" href="#REF_LIST_KEYWORDS">REF
  LIST KEYWORDS</a></h1>
The <i>list</i> command may produce a list of key-value pairs. The following
  keys are defined.
<p class="Pp"><i>object-format</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The refs are using the given hash algorithm. This keyword
  is only used if the server and client both support the object-format
  extension.</div>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
The following options are defined and (under suitable circumstances) set by Git
  if the remote helper has the <i>option</i> capability.
<p class="Pp"><i>option verbosity</i> &lt;n&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Changes the verbosity of messages displayed by the
  helper. A value of 0 for &lt;n&gt; means that processes operate quietly, and
  the helper produces only error output. 1 is the default level of verbosity,
  and higher values of &lt;n&gt; correspond to the number of -v flags passed on
  the command line.</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>option progress</i> {<i>true</i>|<i>false</i>}</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Enables (or disables) progress messages displayed by the
  transport helper during a command.</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>option depth</i> &lt;depth&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Deepens the history of a shallow repository.</div>
<p class="Pp">'option deepen-since &lt;timestamp&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Deepens the history of a shallow repository based on
  time.</div>
<p class="Pp">'option deepen-not &lt;ref&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Deepens the history of a shallow repository excluding
  ref. Multiple options add up.</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>option deepen-relative {'true</i>|<i>false</i>}</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Deepens the history of a shallow repository relative to
  current boundary. Only valid when used with &quot;option depth&quot;.</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>option followtags</i> {<i>true</i>|<i>false</i>}</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If enabled the helper should automatically fetch
  annotated tag objects if the object the tag points at was transferred during
  the fetch command. If the tag is not fetched by the helper a second fetch
  command will usually be sent to ask for the tag specifically. Some helpers may
  be able to use this option to avoid a second network connection.</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>option dry-run</i> {<i>true</i>|<i>false</i>}: If true, pretend
    the operation completed successfully, but don&#x2019;t actually change any
    repository data. For most helpers this only applies to the <i>push</i>, if
