<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>accessor methods</dt>
  <dd>A <b>method</b> used to indirectly inspect or update an <b>object</b>Xs
      state (its <b>instance</b> <b>variables</b>).</dd>
  <dt>actual arguments</dt>
  <dd>The <b>scalar values</b> that you supply to a <b>function</b> or
      <b>subroutine</b> when you call it. For instance, when you call
      <span class="Li">&quot;power(&quot;puff&quot;)&quot;</span>, the string
      <span class="Li">&quot;puff&quot;</span> is the actual argument. See also
      <b>argument</b> and <b>formal arguments</b>.</dd>
  <dt>address operator</dt>
  <dd>Some languages work directly with the memory addresses of values, but this
      can be like playing with fire. Perl provides a set of asbestos gloves for
      handling all memory management. The closest to an address operator in Perl
      is the backslash operator, but it gives you a <b>hard reference</b>, which
      is much safer than a memory address.</dd>
  <dt>algorithm</dt>
  <dd>A well-defined sequence of steps, explained clearly enough that even a
      computer could do them.</dd>
  <dt>alias</dt>
  <dd>A nickname for something, which behaves in all ways as though youXd used
      the original name instead of the nickname. Temporary aliases are
      implicitly created in the loop variable for
      <span class="Li">&quot;foreach&quot;</span> loops, in the
      <span class="Li">$_</span> variable for
      <span class="Li">&quot;map&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;grep&quot;</span> operators, in
      <span class="Li">$a</span> and <span class="Li">$b</span> during
      <span class="Li">&quot;sort&quot;</span>Xs comparison function, and in
      each element of <span class="Li">@_</span> for the <b>actual arguments</b>
      of a subroutine call. Permanent aliases are explicitly created in
      <b>packages</b> by <b>importing</b> symbols or by assignment to
      <b>typeglobs</b>. Lexically scoped aliases for package variables are
      explicitly created by the <span class="Li">&quot;our&quot;</span>
      declaration.</dd>
  <dt>alphabetic</dt>
  <dd>The sort of characters we put into words. In Unicode, this is all letters
      including all ideographs and certain diacritics, letter numbers like Roman
      numerals, and various combining marks.</dd>
  <dt>alternatives</dt>
  <dd>A list of possible choices from which you may select only one, as in,
      XWould you like door A, B, or C?X Alternatives in regular expressions are
      separated with a single vertical bar:
      <span class="Li">&quot;|&quot;</span>. Alternatives in normal Perl
      expressions are separated with a double vertical bar:
      <span class="Li">&quot;||&quot;</span>. Logical alternatives in
      <b>Boolean</b> expressions are separated with either
      <span class="Li">&quot;||&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;or&quot;</span>.</dd>
  <dt>anonymous</dt>
  <dd>Used to describe a <b>referent</b> that is not directly accessible through
      a named <b>variable</b>. Such a referent must be indirectly accessible
      through at least one <b>hard reference</b>. When the last hard reference
      goes away, the anonymous referent is destroyed without pity.</dd>
  <dt>application</dt>
  <dd>A bigger, fancier sort of <b>program</b> with a fancier name so people
      donXt realize they are using a program.</dd>
  <dt>architecture</dt>
  <dd>The kind of computer youXre working on, where one Xkind of computerX means
      all those computers sharing a compatible machine language. Since Perl
      programs are (typically) simple text files, not executable images, a Perl
      program is much less sensitive to the architecture itXs running on than
      programs in other languages, such as C, that are <b>compiled</b> into
      machine code. See also <b>platform</b> and <b>operating system</b>.</dd>
  <dt>argument</dt>
  <dd>A piece of data supplied to a <b>program</b>, <b>subroutine</b>,
      <b>function</b>, or <b>method</b> to tell it what itXs supposed to do.
      Also called a XparameterX.</dd>
  <dt>ARGV</dt>
  <dd>The name of the array containing the <b>argument</b> <b>vector</b> from
      the command line. If you use the empty
      <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;&gt;&quot;</span> operator,
      <span class="Li">&quot;ARGV&quot;</span> is the name of both the
      <b>filehandle</b> used to traverse the arguments and the <b>scalar</b>
      containing the name of the current input file.</dd>
  <dt>arithmetical operator</dt>
  <dd>A <b>symbol</b> such as <span class="Li">&quot;+&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;/&quot;</span> that tells Perl to do the arithmetic
      you were supposed to learn in grade school.</dd>
  <dt>array</dt>
  <dd>An ordered sequence of <b>values</b>, stored such that you can easily
      access any of the values using an <i>integer subscript</i> that specifies
      the valueXs <b>offset</b> in the sequence.</dd>
  <dt>array context</dt>
  <dd>An archaic expression for what is more correctly referred to as <b>list
      context</b>.</dd>
  <dt>Artistic License</dt>
  <dd>The open source license that Larry Wall created for Perl, maximizing
      PerlXs usefulness, availability, and modifiability. The current version is
      2. (&lt;http://www.opensource.org/licenses/artistic-license.php&gt;).</dd>
  <dt>ASCII</dt>
  <dd>The American Standard Code for Information Interchange (a 7-bit character
      set adequate only for poorly representing English text). Often used
      loosely to describe the lowest 128 values of the various ISO-8859-X
      character sets, a bunch of mutually incompatible 8-bit codes best
      described as half ASCII. See also <b>Unicode</b>.</dd>
  <dt>assertion</dt>
  <dd>A component of a <b>regular expression</b> that must be true for the
      pattern to match but does not necessarily match any characters itself.
      Often used specifically to mean a <b>zero-width</b> assertion.</dd>
  <dt>assignment</dt>
  <dd>An <b>operator</b> whose assigned mission in life is to change the value
      of a <b>variable</b>.</dd>
  <dt>assignment operator</dt>
  <dd>Either a regular <b>assignment</b> or a compound <b>operator</b> composed
      of an ordinary assignment and some other operator, that changes the value
      of a variable in place; that is, relative to its old value. For example,
      <span class="Li">&quot;$a += 2&quot;</span> adds <span class="Li">2</span>
      to <span class="Li">$a</span>.</dd>
  <dt>associative array</dt>
  <dd>See <b>hash</b>. Please. The term associative array is the old Perl 4 term
      for a <b>hash</b>. Some languages call it a dictionary.</dd>
  <dt>associativity</dt>
  <dd>Determines whether you do the left <b>operator</b> first or the right
      <b>operator</b> first when you have XA <b>operator</b> B <b>operator</b>
      CX, and the two operators are of the same precedence. Operators like
      <span class="Li">&quot;+&quot;</span> are left associative, while
      operators like <span class="Li">&quot;**&quot;</span> are right
      associative. See Camel chapter 3, XUnary and Binary OperatorsX for a list
      of operators and their associativity.</dd>
  <dt>asynchronous</dt>
  <dd>Said of events or activities whose relative temporal ordering is
      indeterminate because too many things are going on at once. Hence, an
      asynchronous event is one you didnXt know when to expect.</dd>
  <dt>atom</dt>
  <dd>A <b>regular expression</b> component potentially matching a
      <b>substring</b> containing one or more characters and treated as an
      indivisible syntactic unit by any following <b>quantifier</b>. (Contrast
      with an <b>assertion</b> that matches something of <b>zero width</b> and
      may not be quantified.)</dd>
  <dt>atomic operation</dt>
  <dd>When Democritus gave the word XatomX to the indivisible bits of matter, he
      meant literally something that could not be cut: <i>X-</i> (not) +
      <i>-XXXXX</i> (cuttable). An atomic operation is an action that canXt be
      interrupted, not one forbidden in a nuclear-free zone.</dd>
  <dt>attribute</dt>
  <dd>A new feature that allows the declaration of <b>variables</b> and
      <b>subroutines</b> with modifiers, as in <span class="Li">&quot;sub foo :
      locked</span> <span class="Li">method&quot;</span>. Also another name for
      an <b>instance variable</b> of an <b>object</b>.</dd>
  <dt>autogeneration</dt>
  <dd>A feature of <b>operator overloading</b> of <b>objects</b>, whereby the
      behavior of certain <b>operators</b> can be reasonably deduced using more
      fundamental operators. This assumes that the overloaded operators will
      often have the same relationships as the regular operators. See Camel
      chapter 13, XOverloadingX.</dd>
  <dt>autoincrement</dt>
  <dd>To add one to something automatically, hence the name of the
      <span class="Li">&quot;++&quot;</span> operator. To instead subtract one
      from something automatically is known as an XautodecrementX.</dd>
  <dt>autoload</dt>
  <dd>To load on demand. (Also called XlazyX loading.) Specifically, to call an
      <span class="Li">&quot;AUTOLOAD&quot;</span> subroutine on behalf of an
      undefined subroutine.</dd>
  <dt>autosplit</dt>
  <dd>To split a string automatically, as the <i>Xa</i> <b>switch</b> does when
      running under <i>Xp</i> or <i>Xn</i> in order to emulate <b>awk</b>. (See
      also the <span class="Li">&quot;AutoSplit&quot;</span> module, which has
      nothing to do with the <span class="Li">&quot;Xa&quot;</span> switch but a
      lot to do with autoloading.)</dd>
  <dt>autovivification</dt>
  <dd>A Graeco-Roman word meaning Xto bring oneself to lifeX. In Perl, storage
      locations (<b>lvalues</b>) spontaneously generate themselves as needed,
      including the creation of any <b>hard reference</b> values to point to the
      next level of storage. The assignment
      <span class="Li">&quot;$a[5][5][5][5][5] =
      &quot;quintet&quot;&quot;</span> potentially creates five scalar storage
      locations, plus four references (in the first four scalar locations)
      pointing to four new anonymous arrays (to hold the last four scalar
      locations). But the point of autovivification is that you donXt have to
      worry about it.</dd>
  <dt>AV</dt>
  <dd>Short for Xarray valueX, which refers to one of PerlXs internal data types
      that holds an <b>array</b>. The <span class="Li">&quot;AV&quot;</span>
      type is a subclass of <b>SV</b>.</dd>
  <dt>awk</dt>
  <dd>Descriptive editing termXshort for XawkwardX. Also coincidentally refers
      to a venerable text-processing language from which Perl derived some of
      its high-level ideas.</dd>

<h2 class="Ss" id="B"><a class="permalink" href="#B">B</a></h2>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>backreference</dt>
  <dd>A substring <b>captured</b> by a subpattern within unadorned parentheses
      in a <b>regex</b>. Backslashed decimal numbers
      (<span class="Li">&quot;\1&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;\2&quot;</span>, etc.) later in the same pattern
      refer back to the corresponding subpattern in the current match. Outside
      the pattern, the numbered variables (<span class="Li">$1</span>,
      <span class="Li">$2</span>, etc.) continue to refer to these same values,
      as long as the pattern was the last successful match of the current
      <b>dynamic scope</b>.</dd>
  <dt>backtracking</dt>
  <dd>The practice of saying, XIf I had to do it all over, IXd do it
      differently,X and then actually going back and doing it all over
      differently. Mathematically speaking, itXs returning from an unsuccessful
      recursion on a tree of possibilities. Perl backtracks when it attempts to
      match patterns with a <b>regular expression</b>, and its earlier attempts
      donXt pan out. See the section XThe Little Engine That /Couldn(nXt)X in
      Camel chapter 5, XPattern MatchingX.</dd>
  <dt>backward compatibility</dt>
  <dd>Means you can still run your old program because we didnXt break any of
      the features or bugs it was relying on.</dd>
  <dt>bareword</dt>
  <dd>A word sufficiently ambiguous to be deemed illegal under
      <span class="Li">&quot;use strict 'subs'&quot;</span>. In the absence of
      that stricture, a bareword is treated as if quotes were around it.</dd>
  <dt>base class</dt>
  <dd>A generic <b>object</b> type; that is, a <b>class</b> from which other,
      more specific classes are derived genetically by <b>inheritance</b>. Also
      called a XsuperclassX by people who respect their ancestors.</dd>
  <dt>big-endian</dt>
  <dd>From Swift: someone who eats eggs big end first. Also used of computers
      that store the most significant <b>byte</b> of a word at a lower byte
      address than the least significant byte. Often considered superior to
      little-endian machines. See also <b>little-endian</b>.</dd>
  <dt>binary</dt>
  <dd>Having to do with numbers represented in base 2. That means thereXs
      basically two numbers: 0 and 1. Also used to describe a file of XnontextX,
      presumably because such a file makes full use of all the binary bits in
      its bytes. With the advent of <b>Unicode</b>, this distinction, already
      suspect, loses even more of its meaning.</dd>
  <dt>binary operator</dt>
  <dd>An <b>operator</b> that takes two <b>operands</b>.</dd>
  <dt>bind</dt>
  <dd>To assign a specific <b>network address</b> to a <b>socket</b>.</dd>
  <dt>bit</dt>
  <dd>An integer in the range from 0 to 1, inclusive. The smallest possible unit
      of information storage. An eighth of a <b>byte</b> or of a dollar. (The
      term XPieces of EightX comes from being able to split the old Spanish
      dollar into 8 bits, each of which still counted for money. ThatXs why a
      25- cent piece today is still Xtwo bitsX.)</dd>
  <dt>bit shift</dt>
  <dd>The movement of bits left or right in a computer word, which has the
      effect of multiplying or dividing by a power of 2.</dd>
  <dt>bit string</dt>
  <dd>A sequence of <b>bits</b> that is actually being thought of as a sequence
      of bits, for once.</dd>
  <dt>bless</dt>
  <dd>In corporate life, to grant official approval to a thing, as in, XThe VP
      of Engineering has blessed our WebCruncher project.X Similarly, in Perl,
      to grant official approval to a <b>referent</b> so that it can function as
      an <b>object</b>, such as a WebCruncher object. See the
      <span class="Li">&quot;bless&quot;</span> function in Camel chapter 27,
      XFunctionsX.</dd>
  <dt>block</dt>
  <dd>What a <b>process</b> does when it has to wait for something: XMy process
      blocked waiting for the disk.X As an unrelated noun, it refers to a large
      chunk of data, of a size that the <b>operating system</b> likes to deal
      with (normally a power of 2 such as 512 or 8192). Typically refers to a
      chunk of data thatXs coming from or going to a disk file.</dd>
  <dt>BLOCK</dt>
  <dd>A syntactic construct consisting of a sequence of Perl <b>statements</b>
      that is delimited by braces. The <span class="Li">&quot;if&quot;</span>
      and <span class="Li">&quot;while&quot;</span> statements are defined in
      terms of <i></i><i>&quot;BLOCK&quot;</i><i></i>s, for instance. Sometimes
      we also say XblockX to mean a lexical scope; that is, a sequence of
      statements that acts like a <i></i><i>&quot;BLOCK&quot;</i><i></i>, such
      as within an <span class="Li">&quot;eval&quot;</span> or a file, even
      though the statements arenXt delimited by braces.</dd>
  <dt>block buffering</dt>
  <dd>A method of making input and output efficient by passing one <b>block</b>
      at a time. By default, Perl does block buffering to disk files. See
      <b>buffer</b> and <b>command buffering</b>.</dd>
  <dt>Boolean</dt>
  <dd>A value that is either <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>.</dd>
  <dt>Boolean context</dt>
  <dd>A special kind of <b>scalar</b> <b>context</b> used in conditionals to
      decide whether the <b>scalar value</b> returned by an expression is
      <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>. Does not evaluate as either a string or a
      number. See <b>context</b>.</dd>
  <dt>breakpoint</dt>
  <dd>A spot in your program where youXve told the debugger to stop
      <b>execution</b> so you can poke around and see whether anything is wrong
      yet.</dd>
  <dt>broadcast</dt>
  <dd>To send a <b>datagram</b> to multiple destinations simultaneously.</dd>
  <dt>BSD</dt>
  <dd>A psychoactive drug, popular in the X80s, probably developed at UC
      Berkeley or thereabouts. Similar in many ways to the prescription-only
      medication called XSystem VX, but infinitely more useful. (Or, at least,
      more fun.) The full chemical name is XBerkeley Standard
    DistributionX.</dd>
  <dt>bucket</dt>
  <dd>A location in a <b>hash table</b> containing (potentially) multiple
      entries whose keys XhashX to the same hash value according to its hash
      function. (As internal policy, you donXt have to worry about it unless
      youXre into internals, or policy.)</dd>
  <dt>buffer</dt>
  <dd>A temporary holding location for data. Data that are <b>Block
      buffering</b> means that the data is passed on to its destination whenever
      the buffer is full. <b>Line buffering</b> means that itXs passed on
      whenever a complete line is received. <b>Command buffering</b> means that
      itXs passed every time you do a <span class="Li">&quot;print&quot;</span>
      command (or equivalent). If your output is unbuffered, the system
      processes it one byte at a time without the use of a holding area. This
      can be rather inefficient.</dd>
  <dt>built-in</dt>
  <dd>A <b>function</b> that is predefined in the language. Even when hidden by
      <b>overriding</b>, you can always get at a built- in function by
      <b>qualifying</b> its name with the
      <span class="Li">&quot;CORE::&quot;</span> pseudopackage.</dd>
  <dt>bundle</dt>
  <dd>A group of related modules on <b>CPAN</b>. (Also sometimes refers to a
      group of command-line switches grouped into one <b>switch</b>
      <b>cluster</b>.)</dd>
  <dt>byte</dt>
  <dd>A piece of data worth eight <b>bits</b> in most places.</dd>
  <dt>bytecode</dt>
  <dd>A pidgin-like lingo spoken among Xdroids when they donXt wish to reveal
      their orientation (see <b>endian</b>). Named after some similar languages
      spoken (for similar reasons) between compilers and interpreters in the
      late 20XX century. These languages are characterized by representing
      everything as a nonarchitecture-dependent sequence of bytes.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>C</dt>
  <dd>A language beloved by many for its inside-out <b>type</b> definitions,
      inscrutable <b>precedence</b> rules, and heavy <b>overloading</b> of the
      function-call mechanism. (Well, actually, people first switched to C
      because they found lowercase identifiers easier to read than upper.) Perl
      is written in C, so itXs not surprising that Perl borrowed a few ideas

  <dt>cache</dt>
  <dd>A data repository. Instead of computing expensive answers several times,
      compute it once and save the result.</dd>
  <dt>callback</dt>
  <dd>A <b>handler</b> that you register with some other part of your program in

  <dt>call by reference</dt>
  <dd>An <b>argument</b>-passing mechanism in which the <b>formal arguments</b>

  <dt>capturing</dt>
  <dd>The use of parentheses around a <b>subpattern</b> in a <b>regular

  <dt>cargo cult</dt>
  <dd>Copying and pasting code without understanding it, while superstitiously

      dealing with the detritus of explorers and colonizers of technologically
      advanced cultures. See <i>The Gods Must Be Crazy</i>.</dd>
  <dt>case</dt>
  <dd>A property of certain characters. Originally, typesetter stored capital
      letters in the upper of two cases and small letters in the lower one.
      Unicode recognizes three cases: <b>lowercase</b> (<b>character
      property</b> <span class="Li">&quot;\p{lower}&quot;</span>),
      <b>titlecase</b> (<span class="Li">&quot;\p{title}&quot;</span>), and
      <b>uppercase</b> (<span class="Li">&quot;\p{upper}&quot;</span>). A fourth

  <dt>casefolding</dt>
  <dd>Comparing or matching a string case-insensitively. In Perl, it is
      implemented with the <span class="Li">&quot;/i&quot;</span> pattern
      modifier, the <span class="Li">&quot;fc&quot;</span> function, and the

    escape.</dd>
  <dt>casemapping</dt>
  <dd>The process of converting a string to one of the four Unicode

  <dt>character</dt>
  <dd>The smallest individual element of a string. Computers store characters as

      <b>codepoint</b>.</dd>
  <dt>character class</dt>
  <dd>A square-bracketed list of characters used in a <b>regular expression</b>

      <b>objects</b>). See also <b>inheritance</b>.</dd>
  <dt>class method</dt>
  <dd>A <b>method</b> whose <b>invocant</b> is a <b>package</b> name, not an

  <dt>client</dt>
  <dd>In networking, a <b>process</b> that initiates contact with a

  <dt>closure</dt>
  <dd>An <b>anonymous</b> subroutine that, when a reference to it is generated
      at runtime, keeps track of the identities of externally visible <b>lexical
      variables</b>, even after those lexical variables have supposedly gone out
      of <b>scope</b>. TheyXre called XclosuresX because this sort of behavior
      gives mathematicians a sense of closure.</dd>

  <dd>The integer a computer uses to represent a given character. ASCII
      codepoints are in the range 0 to 127; Unicode codepoints are in the range
      0 to 0x1F_FFFF; and Perl codepoints are in the range 0 to 2XXX1 or 0 to

      called <b>ordinals</b>.</dd>
  <dt>code subpattern</dt>
  <dd>A <b>regular expression</b> subpattern whose real purpose is to execute

      <span class="Li">&quot;(??{...})&quot;</span> subpatterns.</dd>
  <dt>collating sequence</dt>
  <dd>The order into which <b>characters</b> sort. This is used by <b>string</b>
      comparison routines to decide, for example, where in this glossary to put
      Xcollating sequenceX.</dd>
  <dt>co-maintainer</dt>
  <dd>A person with permissions to index a <b>namespace</b> in <b>PAUSE</b>.
      Anyone can upload any namespace, but only primary and co-maintainers get
      their contributions indexed.</dd>
  <dt>combining character</dt>
  <dd>Any character with the General Category of Combining Mark
      (<span class="Li">&quot;\p{GC=M}&quot;</span>), which may be spacing or
      nonspacing. Some are even invisible. A sequence of combining characters
      following a grapheme base character together make up a single user-visible
      character called a <b>grapheme</b>. Most but not all diacritics are
      combining characters, and vice versa.</dd>
  <dt>command</dt>
  <dd>In <b>shell</b> programming, the syntactic combination of a program name
      and its arguments. More loosely, anything you type to a shell (a command
      interpreter) that starts it doing something. Even more loosely, a Perl
      <b>statement</b>, which might start with a <b>label</b> and typically ends
      with a semicolon.</dd>
  <dt>command buffering</dt>
  <dd>A mechanism in Perl that lets you store up the output of each Perl
      <b>command</b> and then flush it out as a single request to the
      <b>operating system</b>. ItXs enabled by setting the
      <span class="Li">$|</span> (<span class="Li">$AUTOFLUSH</span>) variable
      to a true value. ItXs used when you donXt want data sitting around, not
      going where itXs supposed to, which may happen because the default on a
      <b>file</b> or <b>pipe</b> is to use <b>block buffering</b>.</dd>
  <dt>command-line arguments</dt>
  <dd>The <b>values</b> you supply along with a program name when you tell a
      <b>shell</b> to execute a <b>command</b>. These values are passed to a
      Perl program through <span class="Li">@ARGV</span>.</dd>
  <dt>command name</dt>
  <dd>The name of the program currently executing, as typed on the command line.
      In C, the <b>command</b> name is passed to the program as the first
      command-line argument. In Perl, it comes in separately as
      <span class="Li">$0</span>.</dd>
  <dt>comment</dt>
  <dd>A remark that doesnXt affect the meaning of the program. In Perl, a
      comment is introduced by a <span class="Li">&quot;#&quot;</span> character
      and continues to the end of the line.</dd>
  <dt>compilation unit</dt>
  <dd>The <b>file</b> (or <b>string</b>, in the case of
      <span class="Li">&quot;eval&quot;</span>) that is currently being
      <b>compiled</b>.</dd>
  <dt>compile</dt>
  <dd>The process of turning source code into a machine-usable form. See
      <b>compile</b> <b>phase</b>.</dd>
  <dt>compile phase</dt>
  <dd>Any time before Perl starts running your main program. See also <b>run
      phase</b>. Compile phase is mostly spent in <b>compile</b> <b>time</b>,
      but may also be spent in <b>runtime</b> when
      <span class="Li">&quot;BEGIN&quot;</span> blocks,
      <span class="Li">&quot;use&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;no&quot;</span> declarations, or constant
      subexpressions are being evaluated. The startup and import code of any
      <span class="Li">&quot;use&quot;</span> declaration is also run during
      compile phase.</dd>
  <dt>compiler</dt>
  <dd>Strictly speaking, a program that munches up another program and spits out
      yet another file containing the program in a Xmore executableX form,
      typically containing native machine instructions. The <i>perl</i> program
      is not a compiler by this definition, but it does contain a kind of
      compiler that takes a program and turns it into a more executable form
      (<b>syntax trees</b>) within the <i>perl</i> process itself, which the
      <b>interpreter</b> then interprets. There are, however, extension
      <b>modules</b> to get Perl to act more like a XrealX compiler. See Camel
      chapter 16, XCompilingX.</dd>
  <dt>compile time</dt>
  <dd>The time when Perl is trying to make sense of your code, as opposed to
      when it thinks it knows what your code means and is merely trying to do
      what it thinks your code says to do, which is <b>runtime</b>.</dd>
  <dt>composer</dt>
  <dd>A XconstructorX for a <b>referent</b> that isnXt really an <b>object</b>,
      like an anonymous array or a hash (or a sonata, for that matter). For
      example, a pair of braces acts as a composer for a hash, and a pair of
      brackets acts as a composer for an array. See the section XCreating
      ReferencesX in Camel chapter 8, XReferencesX.</dd>
  <dt>concatenation</dt>
  <dd>The process of gluing one catXs nose to another catXs tail. Also a similar
      operation on two <b>strings</b>.</dd>
  <dt>conditional</dt>
  <dd>Something XiffyX. See <b>Boolean context</b>.</dd>
  <dt>connection</dt>
  <dd>In telephony, the temporary electrical circuit between the callerXs and
      the calleeXs phone. In networking, the same kind of temporary circuit
      between a <b>client</b> and a <b>server</b>.</dd>
  <dt>construct</dt>
  <dd>As a noun, a piece of syntax made up of smaller pieces. As a transitive
      verb, to create an <b>object</b> using a <b>constructor</b>.</dd>
  <dt>constructor</dt>
  <dd>Any <b>class method</b>, <b>instance</b>, or <b>subroutine</b> that
      composes, initializes, blesses, and returns an <b>object</b>. Sometimes we
      use the term loosely to mean a <b>composer</b>.</dd>
  <dt>context</dt>
  <dd>The surroundings or environment. The context given by the surrounding code
      determines what kind of data a particular <b>expression</b> is expected to
      return. The three primary contexts are <b>list context</b>, <b>scalar</b>,
      and <b>void context</b>. Scalar context is sometimes subdivided into
      <b>Boolean context</b>, <b>numeric context</b>, <b>string context</b>, and
      <b>void</b> <b>context</b>. ThereXs also a XdonXt careX context (which is
      dealt with in Camel chapter 2, XBits and PiecesX, if you care).</dd>
  <dt>continuation</dt>
  <dd>The treatment of more than one physical <b>line</b> as a single logical
      line. <b>Makefile</b> lines are continued by putting a backslash before
      the <b>newline</b>. Mail headers, as defined by RFC 822, are continued by
      putting a space or tab <i>after</i> the newline. In general, lines in Perl
      do not need any form of continuation mark, because <b>whitespace</b>
      (including newlines) is gleefully ignored. Usually.</dd>
  <dt>core dump</dt>
  <dd>The corpse of a <b>process</b>, in the form of a file left in the
      <b>working directory</b> of the process, usually as a result of certain
      kinds of fatal errors.</dd>
  <dt>CPAN</dt>
  <dd>The Comprehensive Perl Archive Network. (See the Camel Preface and Camel
      chapter 19, XCPANX for details.)</dd>
  <dt>C preprocessor</dt>
  <dd>The typical C compilerXs first pass, which processes lines beginning with
      <span class="Li">&quot;#&quot;</span> for conditional compilation and
      macro definition, and does various manipulations of the program text based
      on the current definitions. Also known as <i>cpp</i>(1).</dd>
  <dt>cracker</dt>
  <dd>Someone who breaks security on computer systems. A cracker may be a true
      <b>hacker</b> or only a <b>script kiddie</b>.</dd>
  <dt>currently selected output channel</dt>
  <dd>The last <b>filehandle</b> that was designated with
      <span class="Li">&quot;select(FILEHANDLE)&quot;</span>;
      <span class="Li">&quot;STDOUT&quot;</span>, if no filehandle has been
      selected.</dd>
  <dt>current package</dt>
  <dd>The <b>package</b> in which the current statement is <b>compiled</b>. Scan
      backward in the text of your program through the current <b>lexical
      scope</b> or any enclosing lexical scopes until you find a package
      declaration. ThatXs your current package name.</dd>
  <dt>current working directory</dt>
  <dd>See <b>working directory</b>.</dd>
  <dt>CV</dt>
  <dd>In academia, a curriculum vitae, a fancy kind of resume. In Perl, an

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>dangling statement</dt>
  <dd>A bare, single <b>statement</b>, without any braces, hanging off an

      <span class="Li">&quot;while&quot;</span> conditional. C allows them. Perl
      doesnXt.</dd>
  <dt>datagram</dt>
  <dd>A packet of data, such as a <b>UDP</b> message, that (from the viewpoint
      of the programs involved) can be sent independently over the network. (In
      fact, all packets are sent independently at the <b>IP</b> level, but
      <b>stream</b> protocols such as <b>TCP</b> hide this from your
    program.)</dd>
  <dt>data structure</dt>
  <dd>How your various pieces of data relate to each other and what shape they
      make when you put them all together, as in a rectangular table or a
      triangular tree.</dd>
  <dt>data type</dt>
  <dd>A set of possible values, together with all the operations that know how
      to deal with those values. For example, a numeric data type has a certain
      set of numbers that you can work with, as well as various mathematical
      operations that you can do on the numbers, but would make little sense on,
      say, a string such as <span class="Li">&quot;Kilroy&quot;</span>. Strings
      have their own operations, such as <b>concatenation</b>. Compound types
      made of a number of smaller pieces generally have operations to compose
      and decompose them, and perhaps to rearrange them. <b>Objects</b> that
      model things in the real world often have operations that correspond to
      real activities. For instance, if you model an elevator, your elevator
      object might have an <span class="Li">&quot;open_door&quot;</span>
      <b>method</b>.</dd>
  <dt>DBM</dt>
  <dd>Stands for XDatabase ManagementX routines, a set of routines that emulate
      an <b>associative array</b> using disk files. The routines use a dynamic
      hashing scheme to locate any entry with only two disk accesses. DBM files
      allow a Perl program to keep a persistent <b>hash</b> across multiple
      invocations. You can <span class="Li">&quot;tie&quot;</span> your hash
      variables to various DBM implementations.</dd>
  <dt>declaration</dt>
  <dd>An <b>assertion</b> that states something exists and perhaps describes
      what itXs like, without giving any commitment as to how or where youXll
      use it. A declaration is like the part of your recipe that says, Xtwo cups
      flour, one large egg, four or five tadpolesXX See <b>statement</b> for its
      opposite. Note that some declarations also function as statements.
      Subroutine declarations also act as definitions if a body is
    supplied.</dd>
  <dt>declarator</dt>
  <dd>Something that tells your program what sort of variable youXd like. Perl
      doesnXt require you to declare variables, but you can use
      <span class="Li">&quot;my&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;our&quot;</span>, or
      <span class="Li">&quot;state&quot;</span> to denote that you want
      something other than the default.</dd>
  <dt>decrement</dt>
  <dd>To subtract a value from a variable, as in Xdecrement
      <span class="Li">$x</span>X (meaning to remove 1 from its value) or
      Xdecrement <span class="Li">$x</span> by 3X.</dd>
  <dt>default</dt>
  <dd>A <b>value</b> chosen for you if you donXt supply a value of your
    own.</dd>
  <dt>defined</dt>
  <dd>Having a meaning. Perl thinks that some of the things people try to do are
      devoid of meaning; in particular, making use of variables that have never
      been given a <b>value</b> and performing certain operations on data that
      isnXt there. For example, if you try to read data past the end of a file,
      Perl will hand you back an undefined value. See also <b>false</b> and the
      <span class="Li">&quot;defined&quot;</span> entry in Camel chapter 27,
      XFunctionsX.</dd>
  <dt>delimiter</dt>
  <dd>A <b>character</b> or <b>string</b> that sets bounds to an arbitrarily
      sized textual object, not to be confused with a <b>separator</b> or
      <b>terminator</b>. XTo delimitX really just means Xto surroundX or Xto
      encloseX (like these parentheses are doing).</dd>
  <dt>dereference</dt>
  <dd>A fancy computer science term meaning Xto follow a <b>reference</b> to
      what it points toX. The XdeX part of it refers to the fact that youXre
      taking away one level of <b>indirection</b>.</dd>
  <dt>derived class</dt>
  <dd>A <b>class</b> that defines some of its <b>methods</b> in terms of a more
      generic class, called a <b>base class</b>. Note that classes arenXt
      classified exclusively into base classes or derived classes: a class can
      function as both a derived class and a base class simultaneously, which is
      kind of classy.</dd>
  <dt>descriptor</dt>
  <dd>See <b>file descriptor</b>.</dd>
  <dt>destroy</dt>
  <dd>To deallocate the memory of a <b>referent</b> (first triggering its
      <span class="Li">&quot;DESTROY&quot;</span> method, if it has one).</dd>
  <dt>destructor</dt>
  <dd>A special <b>method</b> that is called when an <b>object</b> is thinking
      about <b>destroying</b> itself. A Perl programXs
      <span class="Li">&quot;DESTROY&quot;</span> method doesnXt do the actual
      destruction; Perl just <b>triggers</b> the method in case the <b>class</b>
      wants to do any associated cleanup.</dd>
  <dt>device</dt>
  <dd>A whiz-bang hardware gizmo (like a disk or tape drive or a modem or a
      joystick or a mouse) attached to your computer, which the <b>operating
      system</b> tries to make look like a <b>file</b> (or a bunch of files).
      Under Unix, these fake files tend to live in the <i>/dev</i>
    directory.</dd>
  <dt>directive</dt>
  <dd>A <b>pod</b> directive. See Camel chapter 23, XPlain Old
    DocumentationX.</dd>
  <dt>directory</dt>
  <dd>A special file that contains other files. Some <b>operating systems</b>
      call these XfoldersX, XdrawersX, XcataloguesX, or XcatalogsX.</dd>
  <dt>directory handle</dt>
  <dd>A name that represents a particular instance of opening a directory to
      read it, until you close it. See the
      <span class="Li">&quot;opendir&quot;</span> function.</dd>
  <dt>discipline</dt>
  <dd>Some people need this and some people avoid it. For Perl, itXs an old way
      to say <b>I/O layer</b>.</dd>
  <dt>dispatch</dt>
  <dd>To send something to its correct destination. Often used metaphorically to
      indicate a transfer of programmatic control to a destination selected
      algorithmically, often by lookup in a table of function <b>references</b>
      or, in the case of object <b>methods</b>, by traversing the inheritance
      tree looking for the most specific definition for the method.</dd>
  <dt>distribution</dt>
  <dd>A standard, bundled release of a system of software. The default usage
      implies source code is included. If that is not the case, it will be
      called a Xbinary-onlyX distribution.</dd>
  <dt>dual-lived</dt>
  <dd>Some modules live both in the <b>Standard Library</b> and on <b>CPAN</b>.
      These modules might be developed on two tracks as people modify either
      version. The trend currently is to untangle these situations.</dd>
  <dt>dweomer</dt>
  <dd>An enchantment, illusion, phantasm, or jugglery. Said when PerlXs magical
      <b>dwimmer</b> effects donXt do what you expect, but rather seem to be the
      product of arcane <i>dweomercraft</i>, sorcery, or wonder working. [From
      Middle English.]</dd>
  <dt>dwimmer</dt>
  <dd>DWIM is an acronym for XDo What I MeanX, the principle that something
      should just do what you want it to do without an undue amount of fuss. A
      bit of code that does XdwimmingX is a XdwimmerX. Dwimming can require a
      great deal of behind-the-scenes magic, which (if it doesnXt stay properly
      behind the scenes) is called a <b>dweomer</b> instead.</dd>
  <dt>dynamic scoping</dt>
  <dd>Dynamic scoping works over a <b>dynamic</b> <b>scope</b>, making variables
      visible throughout the rest of the <b>block</b> in which they are first
      used and in any <b>subroutines</b> that are called by the rest of the
      block. Dynamically scoped variables can have their values temporarily
      changed (and implicitly restored later) by a
      <span class="Li">&quot;local&quot;</span> operator. (Compare <b>lexical
      scoping</b>.) Used more loosely to mean how a subroutine that is in the
      middle of calling another subroutine XcontainsX that subroutine at
      <b>runtime</b>.</dd>

  <dt>fatal error</dt>
  <dd>An uncaught <b>exception</b>, which causes termination of the

      exception message in the <span class="Li">$@</span>
      (<span class="Li">$EVAL_ERROR</span>) variable. You can try to provoke a
      fatal error with the <span class="Li">&quot;die&quot;</span> operator
      (known as throwing or raising an exception), but this may be caught by a

  <dt>file</dt>
  <dd>A named collection of data, usually stored on disk in a <b>directory</b>
      in a <b>filesystem</b>. Roughly like a document, if youXre into office
      metaphors. In modern filesystems, you can actually give a file more than
      one name. Some files have special properties, like directories and
      devices.</dd>
  <dt>file descriptor</dt>
  <dd>The little number the <b>operating</b> <b>system</b> uses to keep track of
      which opened <b>file</b> youXre talking about. Perl hides the file
      descriptor inside a <b>standard I/O</b> stream and then attaches the

  <dt>filehandle</dt>
  <dd>An identifier (not necessarily related to the real name of a file) that

      youXre going to open and close several different files in succession, itXs
      fine to open each of them with the same filehandle, so you donXt have to
      write out separate code to process each file.</dd>
  <dt>filename</dt>
  <dd>One name for a file. This name is listed in a <b>directory</b>. You can
      use it in an <span class="Li">&quot;open&quot;</span> to tell the
      <b>operating system</b> exactly which file you want to open, and associate
      the file with a <b>filehandle</b>, which will carry the subsequent

  <dt>filesystem</dt>
  <dd>A set of <b>directories</b> and <b>files</b> residing on a partition of

  <dt>floating point</dt>
  <dd>A method of storing numbers in Xscientific notationX, such that the

      XfloatsX). Perl does its numeric work with floating-point numbers
      (sometimes called XfloatsX) when it canXt get away with using
      <b>integers</b>. Floating-point numbers are mere approximations of real

  <dt>formal arguments</dt>
  <dd>The generic names by which a <b>subroutine</b> knows its <b>arguments</b>.
      In many languages, formal arguments are always given individual names; in
      Perl, the formal arguments are just the elements of an array. The formal
      arguments to a Perl program are <span class="Li">$ARGV[0]</span>,
      <span class="Li">$ARGV[1]</span>, and so on. Similarly, the formal
      arguments to a Perl subroutine are <span class="Li">$_[0]</span>,
      <span class="Li">$_[1]</span>, and so on. You may give the arguments

  <dt>freeware</dt>
  <dd>Historically, any software that you give away, particularly if you make
      the source code available as well. Now often called <b>open source
      software</b>. Recently there has been a trend to use the term in
      contradistinction to <b>open source software</b>, to refer only to free
      software released under the Free Software FoundationXs GPL (General Public
      License), but this is difficult to justify etymologically.</dd>
  <dt>function</dt>
  <dd>Mathematically, a mapping of each of a set of input values to a particular

  <dd>Looking at your <i>Oxford English</i> <i>Dictionary</i> through a

      donXt change very fast.) Similarly, looking at variables stored in a
      private dictionary (namespace) for each scope, which are visible only from
      their point of declaration down to the end of the lexical scope in which
      they are declared. XSyn. <b>static scoping</b>. XAnt. <b>dynamic

  <dt>lexical variable</dt>
  <dd>A <b>variable</b> subject to <b>lexical scoping</b>, declared by
      <span class="Li">&quot;my&quot;</span>. Often just called a XlexicalX.
      (The <span class="Li">&quot;our&quot;</span> declaration declares a
      lexically scoped name for a global variable, which is not itself a lexical
      variable.)</dd>
  <dt>library</dt>
  <dd>Generally, a collection of procedures. In ancient days, referred to a

  <dt>line buffering</dt>
  <dd>Used by a <b>standard I/O</b> output stream that flushes its <b>buffer</b>

      up line buffering on output that is going to the terminal.</dd>
  <dt>line number</dt>
  <dd>The number of lines read previous to this one, plus 1. Perl keeps a
      separate line number for each source or input file it opens. The current
      source fileXs line number is represented by
      <span class="Li">&quot;__LINE__&quot;</span>. The current input line

  <dt>link</dt>
  <dd>Used as a noun, a name in a <b>directory</b> that represents a
      <b>file</b>. A given file can have multiple links to it. ItXs like having
      the same phone number listed in the phone directory under different names.
      As a verb, to resolve a partially <b>compiled</b> fileXs unresolved
      symbols into a (nearly) executable image. Linking can generally be static
      or dynamic, which has nothing to do with static or dynamic scoping.</dd>
  <dt>LIST</dt>
  <dd>A syntactic construct representing a comma- separated list of expressions,
      evaluated to produce a <b>list value</b>. Each <b>expression</b> in a

  <dt>list</dt>
  <dd>An ordered set of scalar values.</dd>
  <dt>list context</dt>
  <dd>The situation in which an <b>expression</b> is expected by its
      surroundings (the code calling it) to return a list of values rather than
      a single value. Functions that want a

  <dt>list operator</dt>
  <dd>An <b>operator</b> that does something with a list of values, such as

      within a program from any list-generating function to any function or
      construct that provides a <b>list context</b>.</dd>
  <dt>literal</dt>
  <dd>A token in a programming language, such as a number or <b>string</b>, that
      gives you an actual <b>value</b> instead of merely representing possible
      values as a <b>variable</b> does.</dd>
  <dt>little-endian</dt>
  <dd>From Swift: someone who eats eggs little end first. Also used of computers
      that store the least significant <b>byte</b> of a word at a lower byte
      address than the most significant byte. Often considered superior to
      big-endian machines. See also <b>big-endian</b>.</dd>
  <dt>local</dt>
  <dd>Not meaning the same thing everywhere. A global variable in Perl can be
      localized inside a <b>dynamic scope</b> via the

  <dt>loop</dt>
  <dd>A construct that performs something repeatedly, like a roller
    coaster.</dd>
  <dt>loop control statement</dt>
  <dd>Any statement within the body of a loop that can make a loop prematurely
      stop looping or skip an <b>iteration</b>. Generally, you shouldnXt try
      this on roller coasters.</dd>
  <dt>loop label</dt>
  <dd>A kind of key or name attached to a loop (or roller coaster) so that loop

  <dt>lvaluable</dt>
  <dd>Able to serve as an <b>lvalue</b>.</dd>
  <dt>lvalue</dt>
  <dd>Term used by language lawyers for a storage location you can assign a new
      <b>value</b> to, such as a <b>variable</b> or an element of an
      <b>array</b>. The XlX is short for XleftX, as in the left side of an
      assignment, a typical place for lvalues. An <b>lvaluable</b> function or
      expression is one to which a value may be assigned, as in
      <span class="Li">&quot;pos($x) = 10&quot;</span>.</dd>
  <dt>lvalue modifier</dt>
  <dd>An adjectival pseudofunction that warps the meaning of an <b>lvalue</b> in
      some declarative fashion. Currently there are three lvalue modifiers:
      <span class="Li">&quot;my&quot;</span>,

      disk space to hold inactive bits. This can make it seem like you have a
      little more memory than you really do, but itXs not a substitute for real
      memory. The best thing that can be said about virtual memory is that it
      lets your performance degrade gradually rather than suddenly when you run

  <dt>metacharacter</dt>

  <dd>Something you do for someone else to make them happy, like giving them the

      listed by the <span class="Li">&quot;getservent&quot;</span>

  <dt>setgid</dt>
  <dd>Same as <b>setuid</b>, only having to do with giving away <b>group</b>

  <dt>setuid</dt>
  <dd>Said of a program that runs with the privileges of its <b>owner</b> rather
      than (as is usually the case) the privileges of whoever is running it.
      Also describes the bit in the mode word (<b>permission bits</b>) that
      controls the feature. This bit must be explicitly set by the owner to
      enable this feature, and the program must be carefully written not to give
      away more privileges than it ought to.</dd>
  <dt>shared memory</dt>
  <dd>A piece of <b>memory</b> accessible by two different <b>processes</b> who
      otherwise would not see each otherXs memory.</dd>
  <dt>shebang</dt>
  <dd>Irish for the whole McGillicuddy. In Perl culture, a portmanteau of

      sequence that tells the system where to find the interpreter.</dd>
  <dt>shell</dt>
  <dd>A <b>command</b>-line <b>interpreter</b>. The program that interactively
      gives you a prompt, accepts one or more <b>lines</b> of input, and
      executes the programs you mentioned, feeding each of them their proper
      <b>arguments</b> and input data. Shells can also execute scripts
      containing such commands. Under Unix, typical shells include the Bourne
      shell (<i>/bin/sh</i>), the C shell (<i>/bin/csh</i>), and the Korn shell
      (<i>/bin/ksh</i>). Perl is not strictly a shell because itXs not
      interactive (although Perl programs can be interactive).</dd>
  <dt>side effects</dt>
  <dd>Something extra that happens when you evaluate an <b>expression</b>.
      Nowadays it can refer to almost anything. For example, evaluating a simple
      assignment statement typically has the Xside effectX of assigning a value
      to a variable. (And you thought assigning the value was your primary
      intent in the first place!) Likewise, assigning a value to the special
      variable <span class="Li">$|</span> (<span class="Li">$AUTOFLUSH</span>)
      has the side effect of forcing a flush after every
      <span class="Li">&quot;write&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;print&quot;</span> on the currently selected
      filehandle.</dd>
  <dt>sigil</dt>
  <dd>A glyph used in magic. Or, for Perl, the symbol in front of a variable

      <span class="Li">&quot;%&quot;</span>.</dd>
  <dt>signal</dt>
  <dd>A bolt out of the blue; that is, an event triggered by the <b>operating

  <dt>signal handler</dt>
  <dd>A <b>subroutine</b> that, instead of being content to be called in the
      normal fashion, sits around waiting for a bolt out of the blue before it
      will deign to <b>execute</b>. Under Perl, bolts out of the blue are called
      signals, and you send them with the
      <span class="Li">&quot;kill&quot;</span> built-in. See the
      <span class="Li">%SIG</span> hash in Camel chapter 25, XSpecial NamesX and

  <dt>single inheritance</dt>
  <dd>The features you got from your mother, if she told you that you donXt have
      a father. (See also <b>inheritance</b> and <b>multiple inheritance</b>.)
      In computer languages, the idea that <b>classes</b> reproduce asexually so
      that a given class can only have one direct ancestor or <b>base class</b>.
      Perl supplies no such restriction, though you may certainly program Perl
      that way if you like.</dd>

  <dt>socket</dt>
  <dd>An endpoint for network communication among multiple <b>processes</b> that
      works much like a telephone or a post office box. The most important thing
      about a socket is its <b>network address</b> (like a phone number).
      Different kinds of sockets have different kinds of addressesXsome look

  <dt>soft reference</dt>
  <dd>See <b>symbolic reference</b>.</dd>

  <dt>stack</dt>
  <dd>A device you can put things on the top of, and later take them back off in

  <dt>standard</dt>
  <dd>Included in the official Perl distribution, as in a standard module, a

  <dt>standard error</dt>
  <dd>The default output <b>stream</b> for nasty remarks that donXt belong in
      <b>standard output</b>. Represented within a Perl program by the
      output&gt; <b>filehandle</b> <span class="Li">&quot;STDERR&quot;</span>.
      You can use this stream explicitly, but the
      <span class="Li">&quot;die&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;warn&quot;</span> built-ins write to your standard
      error stream automatically (unless trapped or otherwise intercepted).</dd>
  <dt>standard input</dt>
  <dd>The default input <b>stream</b> for your program, which if possible
      shouldnXt care where its data is coming from. Represented within a Perl
      program by the <b>filehandle</b>
      <span class="Li">&quot;STDIN&quot;</span>.</dd>
  <dt>standard I/O</dt>
  <dd>A standard C library for doing <b>buffered</b> input and output to the
      <b>operating system</b>. (The XstandardX of standard I/O is at most
      marginally related to the XstandardX of standard input and output.) In
      general, Perl relies on whatever implementation of standard I/O a given
      operating system supplies, so the buffering characteristics of a Perl
      program on one machine may not exactly match those on another machine.
      Normally this only influences efficiency, not semantics. If your standard
      I/O package is doing block buffering and you want it to <b>flush</b> the
      buffer more often, just set the <span class="Li">$|</span> variable to a
      true value.</dd>
  <dt>Standard Library</dt>
  <dd>Everything that comes with the official <i>perl</i> distribution. Some
      vendor versions of <i>perl</i> change their distributions, leaving out

  <dt>standard output</dt>
  <dd>The default output <b>stream</b> for your program, which if possible

      by the <b>filehandle</b> <span class="Li">&quot;STDOUT&quot;</span>.</dd>
  <dt>statement</dt>
  <dd>A <b>command</b> to the computer about what to do next, like a step in a
      recipe: XAdd marmalade to batter and mix until mixed.X A statement is
      distinguished from a <b>declaration</b>, which doesnXt tell the computer
      to do anything, but just to learn something.</dd>
  <dt>statement modifier</dt>
  <dd>A <b>conditional</b> or <b>loop</b> that you put after the
      <b>statement</b> instead of before, if you know what we mean.</dd>
  <dt>static</dt>
  <dd>Varying slowly compared to something else. (Unfortunately, everything is
      relatively stable compared to something else, except for certain
      elementary particles, and weXre not so sure about them.) In computers,
      where things are supposed to vary rapidly, XstaticX has a derogatory
      connotation, indicating a slightly dysfunctional <b>variable</b>,
      <b>subroutine</b>, or <b>method</b>. In Perl culture, the word is politely
      avoided.

  <dt>stat structure</dt>
  <dd>A special internal spot in which Perl keeps the information about the last

  <dt>status</dt>
  <dd>The <b>value</b> returned to the parent <b>process</b> when one of its
      child processes dies. This value is placed in the special variable
      <span class="Li">$?</span>. Its upper eight <b>bits</b> are the exit
      status of the defunct process, and its lower eight bits identify the
      signal (if any) that the process died from. On Unix systems, this status
      value is the same as the status word returned by <i>wait</i>(2). See

  <dt>stream</dt>
  <dd>A flow of data into or out of a process as a steady sequence of bytes or
      characters, without the appearance of being broken up into packets. This
      is a kind of <b>interface</b>Xthe underlying <b>implementation</b> may
      well break your data up into separate packets for delivery, but this is

  <dt>subpattern</dt>
  <dd>A component of a <b>regular expression</b> pattern.</dd>
  <dt>subroutine</dt>
  <dd>A named or otherwise accessible piece of program that can be invoked from
      elsewhere in the program in order to accomplish some subgoal of the
      program. A subroutine is often parameterized to accomplish different but
      related things depending on its input <b>arguments</b>. If the subroutine
      returns a meaningful <b>value</b>, it is also called a
    <b>function</b>.</dd>

      <b>element</b> in an array.</dd>
  <dt>substitution</dt>

      term to mean <b>variable interpolation</b>.)</dd>
  <dt>substring</dt>
  <dd>A portion of a <b>string</b>, starting at a certain <b>character</b>
      position (<b>offset</b>) and proceeding for a certain number of
      characters.</dd>
  <dt>superclass</dt>
  <dd>See <b>base class</b>.</dd>
  <dt>superuser</dt>
  <dd>The person whom the <b>operating system</b> will let do almost anything.
      Typically your system administrator or someone pretending to be your
      system administrator. On Unix systems, the <b>root</b> user. On Windows
      systems, usually the Administrator user.</dd>
  <dt>SV</dt>
  <dd>Short for Xscalar valueX. But within the Perl interpreter, every
      <b>referent</b> is treated as a member of a class derived from SV, in an
      object-oriented sort of way. Every <b>value</b> inside Perl is passed
      around as a C language <span class="Li">&quot;SV*&quot;</span> pointer.
      The SV <b>struct</b> knows its own Xreferent typeX, and the code is smart
      enough (we hope) not to try to call a <b>hash</b> function on a
      <b>subroutine</b>.</dd>
  <dt>switch</dt>
  <dd>An option you give on a command line to influence the way your program
      works, usually introduced with a minus sign. The word is also used as a
      nickname for a <b>switch statement</b>.</dd>
  <dt>switch cluster</dt>
  <dd>The combination of multiple command- line switches (<i>e.g.</i>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;Xa Xb Xc&quot;</span>) into one switch
      (<i>e.g.</i>, <span class="Li">&quot;Xabc&quot;</span>). Any switch with
      an additional <b>argument</b> must be the last switch in a cluster.</dd>
  <dt>switch statement</dt>
  <dd>A program technique that lets you evaluate an <b>expression</b> and then,
      based on the value of the expression, do a multiway branch to the
      appropriate piece of code for that value. Also called a Xcase structureX,
      named after the similar Pascal construct. Most switch statements in Perl
      are spelled <span class="Li">&quot;given&quot;</span>. See XThe
      <span class="Li">&quot;given&quot;</span> statementX in Camel chapter 4,
      XStatements and DeclarationsX.</dd>
  <dt>symbol</dt>
  <dd>Generally, any <b>token</b> or <b>metasymbol</b>. Often used more
      specifically to mean the sort of name you might find in a <b>symbol</b>
      <b>table</b>.</dd>
  <dt>symbolic debugger</dt>
  <dd>A program that lets you step through the <b>execution</b> of your program,
      stopping or printing things out here and there to see whether anything has
      gone wrong, and, if so, what. The XsymbolicX part just means that you can
      talk to the debugger using the same symbols with which your program is
      written.</dd>
  <dt>symbolic link</dt>
  <dd>An alternate filename that points to the real <b>filename</b>, which in
      turn points to the real <b>file</b>. Whenever the <b>operating system</b>
      is trying to parse a <b>pathname</b> containing a symbolic link, it merely
      substitutes the new name and continues parsing.</dd>
  <dt>symbolic reference</dt>
  <dd>A variable whose value is the name of another variable or subroutine. By
      <b>dereferencing</b> the first variable, you can get at the second one.
      Symbolic references are illegal under <span class="Li">&quot;use strict
      &quot;refs&quot;&quot;</span>.</dd>
  <dt>symbol table</dt>
  <dd>Where a <b>compiler</b> remembers symbols. A program like Perl must
      somehow remember all the names of all the <b>variables</b>,
      <b>filehandles</b>, and <b>subroutines</b> youXve used. It does this by
      placing the names in a symbol table, which is implemented in Perl using a
      <b>hash</b> <b>table</b>. There is a separate symbol table for each
      <b>package</b> to give each package its own <b>namespace</b>.</dd>
  <dt>synchronous</dt>
  <dd>Programming in which the orderly sequence of events can be determined;
      that is, when things happen one after the other, not at the same
    time.</dd>
  <dt>syntactic sugar</dt>
  <dd>An alternative way of writing something more easily; a shortcut.</dd>
  <dt>syntax</dt>
  <dd>From Greek XXXXXXXX, Xwith-arrangementX. How things (particularly symbols)
      are put together with each other.</dd>
  <dt>syntax tree</dt>
  <dd>An internal representation of your program wherein lower-level
      <b>constructs</b> dangle off the higher-level constructs enclosing
    them.</dd>
  <dt>syscall</dt>
  <dd>A <b>function</b> call directly to the <b>operating</b> <b>system</b>.
      Many of the important subroutines and functions you use arenXt direct
      system calls, but are built up in one or more layers above the system call
      level. In general, Perl programmers donXt need to worry about the
      distinction. However, if you do happen to know which Perl functions are
      really syscalls, you can predict which of these will set the
      <span class="Li">$!</span> (<span class="Li">$ERRNO</span>) variable on
      failure. Unfortunately, beginning programmers often confusingly employ the
      term Xsystem callX to mean what happens when you call the Perl
      <span class="Li">&quot;system&quot;</span> function, which actually
      involves many syscalls. To avoid any confusion, we nearly always say
      XsyscallX for something you could call indirectly via PerlXs
      <span class="Li">&quot;syscall&quot;</span> function, and never for
      something you would call with PerlXs
      <span class="Li">&quot;system&quot;</span> function.</dd>

      youXll ordinarily deny access to. See the
      <span class="Li">&quot;umask&quot;</span> function.</dd>
  <dt>unary operator</dt>
  <dd>An operator with only one <b>operand</b>, like
      <span class="Li">&quot;!&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;chdir&quot;</span>. Unary operators are usually
      prefix operators; that is, they precede their operand. The
      <span class="Li">&quot;++&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;XX&quot;</span> operators can be either prefix or
      postfix. (Their position <i>does</i> change their meanings.)</dd>
  <dt>Unicode</dt>
  <dd>A character set comprising all the major character sets of the world, more
      or less. See &lt;http://www.unicode.org&gt;.</dd>
  <dt>Unix</dt>
  <dd>A very large and constantly evolving language with several alternative and
      largely incompatible syntaxes, in which anyone can define anything any way
      they choose, and usually do. Speakers of this language think itXs easy to
      learn because itXs so easily twisted to oneXs own ends, but dialectical
      differences make tribal intercommunication nearly impossible, and
      travelers are often reduced to a pidgin-like subset of the language. To be
      universally understood, a Unix shell programmer must spend years of study
      in the art. Many have abandoned this discipline and now communicate via an
      Esperanto-like language called Perl.
    <p class="Pp">In ancient times, Unix was also used to refer to some code
        that a couple of people at Bell Labs wrote to make use of a PDP-7
        computer that wasnXt doing much of anything else at the time.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>uppercase</dt>
  <dd>In Unicode, not just characters with the General Category of Uppercase
      Letter, but any character with the Uppercase property, including some
      Letter Numbers and Symbols. Not to be confused with <b>titlecase</b>.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>value</dt>
  <dd>An actual piece of data, in contrast to all the variables, references,
      keys, indices, operators, and whatnot that you need to access the
    value.</dd>
  <dt>variable</dt>
  <dd>A named storage location that can hold any of various kinds of
      <b>value</b>, as your program sees fit.</dd>
  <dt>variable interpolation</dt>
  <dd>The <b>interpolation</b> of a scalar or array variable into a string.</dd>
  <dt>variadic</dt>
  <dd>Said of a <b>function</b> that happily receives an indeterminate number of
      <b>actual arguments</b>.</dd>
  <dt>vector</dt>
  <dd>Mathematical jargon for a list of <b>scalar values</b>.</dd>
  <dt>virtual</dt>
  <dd>Providing the appearance of something without the reality, as in: virtual
      memory is not real memory. (See also <b>memory</b>.) The opposite of
      XvirtualX is XtransparentX, which means providing the reality of something
      without the appearance, as in: Perl handles the variable-length UTFX8
      character encoding transparently.</dd>
  <dt>void context</dt>
  <dd>A form of <b>scalar context</b> in which an <b>expression</b> is not
      expected to return any <b>value</b> at all and is evaluated for its
      <b>side effects</b> alone.</dd>
  <dt>v-string</dt>
  <dd>A XversionX or XvectorX <b>string</b> specified with a
      <span class="Li">&quot;v&quot;</span> followed by a series of decimal
      integers in dot notation, for instance,
      <span class="Li">&quot;v1.20.300.4000&quot;</span>. Each number turns into
      a <b>character</b> with the specified ordinal value. (The
      <span class="Li">&quot;v&quot;</span> is optional when there are at least
      three integers.)</dd>

      to the effect that something might be wrong but isnXt worth blowing up
      over. See <span class="Li">&quot;warn&quot;</span> in Camel chapter 27,
      XFunctionsX and the <span class="Li">&quot;warnings&quot;</span> pragma in
      Camel chapter 28, XPragmantic ModulesX.</dd>
  <dt>watch expression</dt>
  <dd>An expression which, when its value changes, causes a breakpoint in the
      Perl debugger.</dd>
  <dt>weak reference</dt>
  <dd>A reference that doesnXt get counted normally. When all the normal
      references to data disappear, the data disappears. These are useful for
      circular references that would never disappear otherwise.</dd>
  <dt>whitespace</dt>
  <dd>A <b>character</b> that moves your cursor but doesnXt otherwise put
      anything on your screen. Typically refers to any of: space, tab, line
      feed, carriage return, or form feed. In Unicode, matches many other
      characters that Unicode considers whitespace, including the X-XX .</dd>
  <dt>word</dt>
  <dd>In normal XcomputereseX, the piece of data of the size most efficiently
      handled by your computer, typically 32 bits or so, give or take a few
      powers of 2. In Perl culture, it more often refers to an alphanumeric
      <b>identifier</b> (including underscores), or to a string of nonwhitespace
      <b>characters</b> bounded by whitespace or string boundaries.</dd>
  <dt>working directory</dt>
  <dd>Your current <b>directory</b>, from which relative pathnames are
      interpreted by the <b>operating system</b>. The operating system knows
      your current directory because you told it with a
      <span class="Li">&quot;chdir&quot;</span>, or because you started out in
      the place where your parent <b>process</b> was when you were born.</dd>
  <dt>wrapper</dt>
  <dd>A program or subroutine that runs some other program or subroutine for
      you, modifying some of its input or output to better suit your
    purposes.</dd>
  <dt>WYSIWYG</dt>
  <dd>What You See Is What You Get. Usually used when something that appears on
      the screen matches how it will eventually look, like PerlXs
      <span class="Li">&quot;format&quot;</span> declarations. Also used to mean
      the opposite of magic because everything works exactly as it appears, as
      in the three- argument form of
    <span class="Li">&quot;open&quot;</span>.</dd>
