<p class="Pp">Pod::Man is a module to convert documentation in the POD format
    (the preferred language for documenting Perl) into *roff input using the man
    macro set. The resulting *roff code is suitable for display on a terminal
    using <b>nroff</b>(1), normally via <b>man</b>(1), or printing using
    <b>troff</b>(1). It is conventionally invoked using the driver script
    <b>pod2man</b>, but it can also be used directly.</p>
<p class="Pp">As a derived class from Pod::Simple, Pod::Man supports the same
    methods and interfaces. See Pod::Simple for all the details.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>new()</b> can take options, in the form of key/value pairs that
    control the behavior of the parser. See below for details.</p>
<p class="Pp">If no options are given, Pod::Man uses the name of the input file
    with any trailing <span class="Li">&quot;.pod&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;.pm&quot;</span>, or
    <span class="Li">&quot;.pl&quot;</span> stripped as the man page title, to
    section 1 unless the file ended in <span class="Li">&quot;.pm&quot;</span>
    in which case it defaults to section 3, to a centered title of &quot;User
    Contributed Perl Documentation&quot;, to a centered footer of the Perl
    version it is run with, and to a left-hand footer of the modification date
    of its input (or the current date if given
    <span class="Li">&quot;STDIN&quot;</span> for input).</p>
<p class="Pp">Pod::Man assumes that your *roff formatters have a fixed-width
    font named <span class="Li">&quot;CW&quot;</span>. If yours is called
    something else (like <span class="Li">&quot;CR&quot;</span>), use the
    <span class="Li">&quot;fixed&quot;</span> option to specify it. This
    generally only matters for troff output for printing. Similarly, you can set
    the fonts used for bold, italic, and bold italic fixed-width output.</p>
<p class="Pp">Besides the obvious pod conversions, Pod::Man also takes care of
    formatting <b>func()</b>, <b>func</b>(3), and simple variable references
    like <span class="Li">$foo</span> or <span class="Li">@bar</span> so you
    don't have to use code escapes for them; complex expressions like
    <span class="Li">$fred{'stuff'}</span> will still need to be escaped,
    though. It also translates dashes that aren't used as hyphens into en
    dashes, makes long dashes--like this--into proper em dashes, fixes
    &quot;paired quotes,&quot; makes C++ look right, puts a little space between
    double underscores, makes ALLCAPS a teeny bit smaller in <b>troff</b>, and
    escapes stuff that *roff treats as special so that you don't have to.</p>
<p class="Pp">The recognized options to <b>new()</b> are as follows. All options
    take a single argument.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="center"><a class="permalink" href="#center">center</a></dt>
  <dd>Sets the centered page header for the
      <span class="Li">&quot;.TH&quot;</span> macro. The default, if this option
      is not specified, is &quot;User Contributed Perl Documentation&quot;.</dd>
  <dt id="date"><a class="permalink" href="#date">date</a></dt>
  <dd>Sets the left-hand footer for the <span class="Li">&quot;.TH&quot;</span>
      macro. If this option is not set, the contents of the environment variable
      POD_MAN_DATE, if set, will be used. Failing that, the value of
      SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH, the modification date of the input file, or the current
      time if <b>stat()</b> can't find that file (which will be the case if the
      input is from <span class="Li">&quot;STDIN&quot;</span>) will be used. If
      obtained from the file modification date or the current time, the date
      will be formatted as <span class="Li">&quot;YYYY-MM-DD&quot;</span> and
      will be based on UTC (so that the output will be reproducible regardless
      of local time zone).</dd>
  <dt id="errors"><a class="permalink" href="#errors">errors</a></dt>
  <dd>How to report errors. <span class="Li">&quot;die&quot;</span> says to
      throw an exception on any POD formatting error.
      <span class="Li">&quot;stderr&quot;</span> says to report errors on
      standard error, but not to throw an exception.
      <span class="Li">&quot;pod&quot;</span> says to include a POD ERRORS
      section in the resulting documentation summarizing the errors.
      <span class="Li">&quot;none&quot;</span> ignores POD errors entirely, as
      much as possible.
    <p class="Pp">The default is <span class="Li">&quot;pod&quot;</span>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="fixed"><a class="permalink" href="#fixed">fixed</a></dt>
  <dd>The fixed-width font to use for verbatim text and code. Defaults to
      <span class="Li">&quot;CW&quot;</span>. Some systems may want
      <span class="Li">&quot;CR&quot;</span> instead. Only matters for
      <b>troff</b> output.</dd>
  <dt id="fixedbold"><a class="permalink" href="#fixedbold">fixedbold</a></dt>
  <dd>Bold version of the fixed-width font. Defaults to
      <span class="Li">&quot;CB&quot;</span>. Only matters for <b>troff</b>
      output.</dd>
  <dt id="fixeditalic"><a class="permalink" href="#fixeditalic">fixeditalic</a></dt>
  <dd>Italic version of the fixed-width font (actually, something of a misnomer,
      since most fixed-width fonts only have an oblique version, not an italic
      version). Defaults to <span class="Li">&quot;CI&quot;</span>. Only matters
      for <b>troff</b> output.</dd>
  <dt id="fixedbolditalic"><a class="permalink" href="#fixedbolditalic">fixedbolditalic</a></dt>
  <dd>Bold italic (probably actually oblique) version of the fixed-width font.
      Pod::Man doesn't assume you have this, and defaults to
      <span class="Li">&quot;CB&quot;</span>. Some systems (such as Solaris)
      have this font available as <span class="Li">&quot;CX&quot;</span>. Only
      matters for <b>troff</b> output.</dd>
  <dt id="lquote"><a class="permalink" href="#lquote">lquote</a></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt id="rquote"><a class="permalink" href="#rquote">rquote</a></dt>
  <dd>Sets the quote marks used to surround C&lt;&gt; text.
      <span class="Li">&quot;lquote&quot;</span> sets the left quote mark and
      <span class="Li">&quot;rquote&quot;</span> sets the right quote mark.
      Either may also be set to the special value
      <span class="Li">&quot;none&quot;</span>, in which case no quote mark is
      added on that side of C&lt;&gt; text (but the font is still changed for
      troff output).
    <p class="Pp">Also see the <span class="Li">&quot;quotes&quot;</span>
        option, which can be used to set both quotes at once. If both
        <span class="Li">&quot;quotes&quot;</span> and one of the other options
        is set, <span class="Li">&quot;lquote&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;rquote&quot;</span> overrides
        <span class="Li">&quot;quotes&quot;</span>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="name"><a class="permalink" href="#name">name</a></dt>
  <dd>Set the name of the manual page for the
      <span class="Li">&quot;.TH&quot;</span> macro. Without this option, the
      manual name is set to the uppercased base name of the file being converted
      unless the manual section is 3, in which case the path is parsed to see if
      it is a Perl module path. If it is, a path like
      <span class="Li">&quot;.../lib/Pod/Man.pm&quot;</span> is converted into a
      name like <span class="Li">&quot;Pod::Man&quot;</span>. This option, if
      given, overrides any automatic determination of the name.
    <p class="Pp">If generating a manual page from standard input, the name will
        be set to <span class="Li">&quot;STDIN&quot;</span> if this option is
        not provided. Providing this option is strongly recommended to set a
        meaningful manual page name.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="nourls"><a class="permalink" href="#nourls">nourls</a></dt>
  <dd>Normally, L&lt;&gt; formatting codes with a URL but anchor text are
      formatted to show both the anchor text and the URL. In other words:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    L&lt;foo|http://example.com/&gt;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">is formatted as:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    foo &lt;http://example.com/&gt;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This option, if set to a true value, suppresses the URL when
        anchor text is given, so this example would be formatted as just
        <span class="Li">&quot;foo&quot;</span>. This can produce less cluttered
        output in cases where the URLs are not particularly important.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="quotes"><a class="permalink" href="#quotes">quotes</a></dt>
  <dd>Sets the quote marks used to surround C&lt;&gt; text. If the value is a
      single character, it is used as both the left and right quote. Otherwise,
      it is split in half, and the first half of the string is used as the left
      quote and the second is used as the right quote.
    <p class="Pp">This may also be set to the special value
        <span class="Li">&quot;none&quot;</span>, in which case no quote marks
        are added around C&lt;&gt; text (but the font is still changed for troff
        output).</p>
    <p class="Pp">Also see the <span class="Li">&quot;lquote&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;rquote&quot;</span> options, which can be used to
        set the left and right quotes independently. If both
        <span class="Li">&quot;quotes&quot;</span> and one of the other options
        is set, <span class="Li">&quot;lquote&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;rquote&quot;</span> overrides
        <span class="Li">&quot;quotes&quot;</span>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="release"><a class="permalink" href="#release">release</a></dt>
  <dd>Set the centered footer for the <span class="Li">&quot;.TH&quot;</span>
      macro. By default, this is set to the version of Perl you run Pod::Man
      under. Setting this to the empty string will cause some *roff
      implementations to use the system default value.
    <p class="Pp">Note that some system <span class="Li">&quot;an&quot;</span>
        macro sets assume that the centered footer will be a modification date
        and will prepend something like &quot;Last modified: &quot;. If this is
        the case for your target system, you may want to set
        <span class="Li">&quot;release&quot;</span> to the last modified date
        and <span class="Li">&quot;date&quot;</span> to the version number.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="section"><a class="permalink" href="#section">section</a></dt>
  <dd>Set the section for the <span class="Li">&quot;.TH&quot;</span> macro. The
      standard section numbering convention is to use 1 for user commands, 2 for
      system calls, 3 for functions, 4 for devices, 5 for file formats, 6 for
      games, 7 for miscellaneous information, and 8 for administrator commands.
      There is a lot of variation here, however; some systems (like Solaris) use
      4 for file formats, 5 for miscellaneous information, and 7 for devices.
      Still others use 1m instead of 8, or some mix of both. About the only
      section numbers that are reliably consistent are 1, 2, and 3.
    <p class="Pp">By default, section 1 will be used unless the file ends in
        <span class="Li">&quot;.pm&quot;</span> in which case section 3 will be
        selected.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="stderr"><a class="permalink" href="#stderr">stderr</a></dt>
  <dd>Send error messages about invalid POD to standard error instead of
      appending a POD ERRORS section to the generated *roff output. This is
      equivalent to setting <span class="Li">&quot;errors&quot;</span> to
      <span class="Li">&quot;stderr&quot;</span> if
      <span class="Li">&quot;errors&quot;</span> is not already set. It is
      supported for backward compatibility.</dd>
  <dt id="utf8"><a class="permalink" href="#utf8">utf8</a></dt>
  <dd>By default, Pod::Man produces the most conservative possible *roff output
      to try to ensure that it will work with as many different *roff
      implementations as possible. Many *roff implementations cannot handle
      non-ASCII characters, so this means all non-ASCII characters are converted
      either to a *roff escape sequence that tries to create a properly accented
      character (at least for troff output) or to
      <span class="Li">&quot;X&quot;</span>.
    <p class="Pp">If this option is set, Pod::Man will instead output UTF-8. If
        your *roff implementation can handle it, this is the best output format
        to use and avoids corruption of documents containing non-ASCII
        characters. However, be warned that *roff source with literal UTF-8
        characters is not supported by many implementations and may even result
        in segfaults and other bad behavior.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Be aware that, when using this option, the input encoding of
        your POD source should be properly declared unless it's US-ASCII.
        Pod::Simple will attempt to guess the encoding and may be successful if
        it's Latin-1 or UTF-8, but it will produce warnings. Use the
        <span class="Li">&quot;=encoding&quot;</span> command to declare the
        encoding. See <b>perlpod</b>(1) for more information.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The standard Pod::Simple method <b>parse_file()</b> takes one
    argument naming the POD file to read from. By default, the output is sent to
    <span class="Li">&quot;STDOUT&quot;</span>, but this can be changed with the
    <b>output_fh()</b> method.</p>
<p class="Pp">The standard Pod::Simple method <b>parse_from_file()</b> takes up
    to two arguments, the first being the input file to read POD from and the
    second being the file to write the formatted output to.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can also call <b>parse_lines()</b> to parse an array of lines
    or <b>parse_string_document()</b> to parse a document already in memory. As
    with <b>parse_file()</b>, <b>parse_lines()</b> and
    <b>parse_string_document()</b> default to sending their output to
    <span class="Li">&quot;STDOUT&quot;</span> unless changed with the
    <b>output_fh()</b> method. Be aware that <b>parse_lines()</b> and
    <b>parse_string_document()</b> both expect raw bytes, not decoded
    characters.</p>
<p class="Pp">To put the output from any parse method into a string instead of a
    file handle, call the <b>output_string()</b> method instead of
    <b>output_fh()</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">See Pod::Simple for more specific details on the methods available

<p class="Pp">Encoding handling assumes that PerlIO is available and does not
    work properly if it isn't. The <span class="Li">&quot;utf8&quot;</span>
    option is therefore not supported unless Perl is built with PerlIO
  support.</p>
<p class="Pp">There is currently no way to turn off the guesswork that tries to
    format unmarked text appropriately, and sometimes it isn't wanted
    (particularly when using POD to document something other than Perl). Most of
    the work toward fixing this has now been done, however, and all that's still
    needed is a user interface.</p>
<p class="Pp">The NAME section should be recognized specially and index entries
    emitted for everything in that section. This would have to be deferred until
    the next section, since extraneous things in NAME tends to confuse various
    man page processors. Currently, no index entries are emitted for anything in
    NAME.</p>
<p class="Pp">Pod::Man doesn't handle font names longer than two characters.
    Neither do most <b>troff</b> implementations, but GNU troff does as an
    extension. It would be nice to support as an option for those who want to
    use it.</p>
<p class="Pp">The preamble added to each output file is rather verbose, and most
    of it is only necessary in the presence of non-ASCII characters. It would
    ideally be nice if all of those definitions were only output if needed,
    perhaps on the fly as the characters are used.</p>
<p class="Pp">Pod::Man is excessively slow.</p>

<p class="Pp">If Pod::Man is given the <span class="Li">&quot;utf8&quot;</span>
    option, the encoding of its output file handle will be forced to UTF-8 if
    possible, overriding any existing encoding. This will be done even if the
    file handle is not created by Pod::Man and was passed in from outside. This
    maintains consistency regardless of PERL_UNICODE and other settings.</p>
<p class="Pp">The handling of hyphens and em dashes is somewhat fragile, and one
    may get the wrong one under some circumstances. This should only matter for
    <b>troff</b> output.</p>
<p class="Pp">When and whether to use small caps is somewhat tricky, and
    Pod::Man doesn't necessarily get it right.</p>
<p class="Pp">Converting neutral double quotes to properly matched double quotes
    doesn't work unless there are no formatting codes between the quote marks.
