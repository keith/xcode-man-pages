   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

  .b

  	# BS - start boxed text
  	# ^y = starting y location
  	# ^b = 1
  	# BE - end boxed text (draw box now)
  	Draw four-sided box normally, but don't draw top of
  	box if the box started on an earlier page.
  	# VS - start vertical sidebar
  	# ^Y = starting y location
  	# ^v = 1 (for troff;  for nroff this doesn't matter)
  	# VE - end of vertical sidebar
  	# Special macro to handle page bottom:  finish off current
  	# box/sidebar if in box/sidebar mode, then invoked standard
  	# page bottom macro.
  	Draw three-sided box if this is the box's first page,
  	draw two sides but no top otherwise.

This command is used to create <i>file event handlers</i>. A file event handler
  is a binding between a channel and a script, such that the script is evaluated
  whenever the channel becomes readable or writable. File event handlers are
  most commonly used to allow data to be received from another process on an
  event-driven basis, so that the receiver can continue to interact with the
  user while waiting for the data to arrive. If an application invokes
  <b>gets</b> or <b>read</b> on a blocking channel when there is no input data
  available, the process will block; until the input data arrives, it will not
  be able to service other events, so it will appear to the user to
  &#x201C;freeze up&#x201D;. With <b>fileevent</b>, the process can tell when
  data is present and only invoke <b>gets</b> or <b>read</b> when they will not
  block.
<p class="Pp">The <i>channelId</i> argument to <b>fileevent</b> refers to an
    open channel such as a Tcl standard channel (<b>stdin</b>, <b>stdout</b>, or
    <b>stderr</b>), the return value from an invocation of <b>open</b> or
    <b>socket</b>, or the result of a channel creation command provided by a Tcl
    extension.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the <i>script</i> argument is specified, then <b>fileevent</b>
    creates a new event handler: <i>script</i> will be evaluated whenever the
    channel becomes readable or writable (depending on the second argument to
    <b>fileevent</b>). In this case <b>fileevent</b> returns an empty string.
    The <b>readable</b> and <b>writable</b> event handlers for a file are
    independent, and may be created and deleted separately. However, there may
    be at most one <b>readable</b> and one <b>writable</b> handler for a file at
    a given time in a given interpreter. If <b>fileevent</b> is called when the
    specified handler already exists in the invoking interpreter, the new script
    replaces the old one.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the <i>script</i> argument is not specified, <b>fileevent</b>
    returns the current script for <i>channelId</i>, or an empty string if there
    is none. If the <i>script</i> argument is specified as an empty string then
    the event handler is deleted, so that no script will be invoked. A file
    event handler is also deleted automatically whenever its channel is closed
    or its interpreter is deleted.</p>
<p class="Pp">A channel is considered to be readable if there is unread data
    available on the underlying device. A channel is also considered to be
    readable if there is unread data in an input buffer, except in the special
    case where the most recent attempt to read from the channel was a
    <b>gets</b> call that could not find a complete line in the input buffer.
    This feature allows a file to be read a line at a time in nonblocking mode
    using events. A channel is also considered to be readable if an end of file
    or error condition is present on the underlying file or device. It is
    important for <i>script</i> to check for these conditions and handle them
    appropriately; for example, if there is no special check for end of file, an
    infinite loop may occur where <i>script</i> reads no data, returns, and is
    immediately invoked again.</p>
<p class="Pp">A channel is considered to be writable if at least one byte of
    data can be written to the underlying file or device without blocking, or if
    an error condition is present on the underlying file or device.</p>
<p class="Pp">Event-driven I/O works best for channels that have been placed
    into nonblocking mode with the <b>fconfigure</b> command. In blocking mode,
    a <b>puts</b> command may block if you give it more data than the underlying
    file or device can accept, and a <b>gets</b> or <b>read</b> command will
    block if you attempt to read more data than is ready; no events will be
    processed while the commands block. In nonblocking mode <b>puts</b>,
    <b>read</b>, and <b>gets</b> never block. See the documentation for the
    individual commands for information on how they handle blocking and
    nonblocking channels.</p>
<p class="Pp">The script for a file event is executed at global level (outside
    the context of any Tcl procedure) in the interpreter in which the
    <b>fileevent</b> command was invoked. If an error occurs while executing the
    script then the command registered with <b>interp bgerror</b> is used to
    report the error. In addition, the file event handler is deleted if it ever
    returns an error; this is done in order to prevent infinite loops due to
    buggy handlers.</p>
