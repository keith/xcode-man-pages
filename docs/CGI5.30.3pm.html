<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
CGI.pm is a stable, complete and mature solution for processing and preparing
  HTTP requests and responses. Major features including processing form
  submissions, file uploads, reading and writing cookies, query string
  generation and manipulation, and processing and preparing HTTP headers.
<p class="Pp">CGI.pm performs very well in a vanilla CGI.pm environment and also
    comes with built-in support for mod_perl and mod_perl2 as well as
  FastCGI.</p>
<p class="Pp">It has the benefit of having developed and refined over 20 years
    with input from dozens of contributors and being deployed on thousands of
    websites. CGI.pm was included in the perl distribution from perl v5.4 to
    v5.20, however is has now been removed from the perl core...</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="CGI.pm_HAS_BEEN_REMOVED_FROM_THE_PERL_CORE"><a class="permalink" href="#CGI.pm_HAS_BEEN_REMOVED_FROM_THE_PERL_CORE">CGI.pm
  HAS BEEN REMOVED FROM THE PERL CORE</a></h1>
&lt;http://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git/commitdiff/e9fa5a80&gt;
<p class="Pp">If you upgrade to a new version of perl or if you rely on a system
    or vendor perl and get an updated version of perl through a system update,
    then you will have to install CGI.pm yourself with cpan/cpanm/a vendor
    package/manually. To make this a little easier the CGI::Fast module has been
    split into its own distribution, meaning you do not need access to a
    compiler to install CGI.pm</p>
<p class="Pp">The rationale for this decision is that CGI.pm is no longer
    considered good practice for developing web applications, <b>including</b>
    quick prototyping and small web scripts. There are far better, cleaner,
    quicker, easier, safer, more scalable, more extensible, more modern
    alternatives available at this point in time. These will be documented with
    CGI::Alternatives.</p>
<p class="Pp">For more discussion on the removal of CGI.pm from core please
  see:</p>
<p class="Pp">&lt;http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2013/05/msg202130.html&gt;</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that the v4 releases of CGI.pm will retain back compatibility
    <b>as much</b> <b>as possible</b>, however you may need to make some minor
    changes to your code if you are using deprecated methods or some of the more
    obscure features of the module. If you plan to upgrade to v4.00 and beyond
    you should read the Changes file for more information and <b>test your
    code</b> against CGI.pm before deploying it.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="HTML_Generation_functions_should_no_longer_be_used"><a class="permalink" href="#HTML_Generation_functions_should_no_longer_be_used">HTML
  Generation functions should no longer be used</a></h1>
<b>All</b> HTML generation functions within CGI.pm are no longer being
  maintained. Any issues, bugs, or patches will be rejected unless they relate
  to fundamentally broken page rendering.
<p class="Pp">The rationale for this is that the HTML generation functions of
    CGI.pm are an obfuscation at best and a maintenance nightmare at worst. You
    should be using a template engine for better separation of concerns. See
    CGI::Alternatives for an example of using CGI.pm with the Template::Toolkit
    module.</p>
<p class="Pp">These functions, and perldoc for them, are considered deprecated,
    they are no longer being maintained and no fixes or features for them will
    be accepted. They will, however, continue to exist in CGI.pm without any
    deprecation warnings (&quot;soft&quot; deprecation) so you can continue to
    use them if you really want to. All documentation for these functions has
    been moved to CGI::HTML::Functions.</p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="Programming_style"><a class="permalink" href="#Programming_style">Programming
  style</a></h1>
There are two styles of programming with CGI.pm, an object-oriented (OO) style
  and a function-oriented style. You are recommended to use the OO style as
  CGI.pm will create an internal default object when the functions are called
  procedurally and you will not have to worry about method names clashing with
  perl builtins.
<p class="Pp">In the object-oriented style you create one or more CGI objects
    and then use object methods to create the various elements of the page. Each
    CGI object starts out with the list of named parameters that were passed to
    your CGI script by the server. You can modify the objects, save them to a
    file or database and recreate them. Because each object corresponds to the
    &quot;state&quot; of the CGI script, and because each object's parameter
    list is independent of the others, this allows you to save the state of the
    script and restore it later.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, using the object oriented style:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    #!/usr/bin/env perl

    use strict;
    use warnings;

    use CGI;                             # load CGI routines

    my $q = CGI-&gt;new;                    # create new CGI object
    print $q-&gt;header;                    # create the HTTP header
</pre>
<p class="Pp">In the function-oriented style, there is one default CGI object
    that you rarely deal with directly. Instead you just call functions to
    retrieve CGI parameters, manage cookies, and so on. The following example is
    identical to above, in terms of output, but uses the function-oriented
    interface. The main differences are that we now need to import a set of
    functions into our name space (usually the &quot;standard&quot; functions),
    and we don't need to create the CGI object.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    #!/usr/bin/env perl

    use strict;
    use warnings;

    use CGI qw/:standard/;           # load standard CGI routines
    print header();                  # create the HTTP header
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The examples in this document mainly use the object-oriented
    style. See HOW TO IMPORT FUNCTIONS for important information on
    function-oriented programming in CGI.pm</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Calling__s-1CGI_s0.pm_routines"><a class="permalink" href="#Calling__s-1CGI_s0.pm_routines">Calling
  CGI.pm routines</a></h2>
Most CGI.pm routines accept several arguments, sometimes as many as 20 optional
  ones! To simplify this interface, all routines use a named argument calling
  style that looks like this:
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    print $q-&gt;header(
        -type    =&gt; 'image/gif',
        -expires =&gt; '+3d',
    );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Each argument name is preceded by a dash. Neither case nor order
    matters in the argument list: -type, -Type, and -TYPE are all acceptable. In
    fact, only the first argument needs to begin with a dash. If a dash is
    present in the first argument CGI.pm assumes dashes for the subsequent
  ones.</p>
<p class="Pp">Several routines are commonly called with just one argument. In
    the case of these routines you can provide the single argument without an
    argument name. <b>header()</b> happens to be one of these routines. In this
    case, the single argument is the document type.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    print $q-&gt;header('text/html');
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Other such routines are documented below.</p>
<p class="Pp">Sometimes named arguments expect a scalar, sometimes a reference
    to an array, and sometimes a reference to a hash. Often, you can pass any
    type of argument and the routine will do whatever is most appropriate. For
    example, the <b>param()</b> routine is used to set a CGI parameter to a
    single or a multi-valued value. The two cases are shown below:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    $q-&gt;param(
        -name  =&gt; 'veggie',
        -value =&gt; 'tomato',
    );

    $q-&gt;param(
        -name  =&gt; 'veggie',
        -value =&gt; [ qw/tomato tomahto potato potahto/ ],
    );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Many routines will do something useful with a named argument that
    it doesn't recognize. For example, you can produce non-standard HTTP header
    fields by providing them as named arguments:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    print $q-&gt;header(
        -type            =&gt; 'text/html',
        -cost            =&gt; 'Three smackers',
        -annoyance_level =&gt; 'high',
        -complaints_to   =&gt; 'bit bucket',
    );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This will produce the following nonstandard HTTP header:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    HTTP/1.0 200 OK
    Cost: Three smackers
    Annoyance-level: high
    Complaints-to: bit bucket
    Content-type: text/html
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Notice the way that underscores are translated automatically into
    hyphens.</p>

<p class="Pp">If you provide a file handle to the <b>new()</b> method, it will
    read parameters from the file (or STDIN, or whatever). The file can be in
    any of the forms describing below under debugging (i.e. a series of newline

    created by the <b>save()</b> method (see below). Multiple records can be
    saved and restored.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl purists will be pleased to know that this syntax accepts
    references to file handles, or even references to filehandle globs, which is
    the &quot;official&quot; way to pass a filehandle. You can also initialize
    the CGI object with a FileHandle or IO::File object.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you are using the function-oriented interface and want to
    initialize CGI state from a file handle, the way to do this is with
    <b></b><b>restore_parameters()</b><b></b>. This will (re)initialize the
    default CGI object from the indicated file handle.</p>

<p class="Pp"><b>Warning</b> - calling <b>param()</b> in list context can lead

If POSTed data is not of type application/x-www-form-urlencoded or
  multipart/form-data, then the POSTed data will not be processed, but instead
  be returned as-is in a parameter named POSTDATA. To retrieve it, use code like
  this:
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    my $data = $q-&gt;param('POSTDATA');
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Likewise if PUTed and PATCHed data can be retrieved with code like

<p class="Pp">Many people want to fetch the entire parameter list as a hash in
    which the keys are the names of the CGI parameters, and the values are the
    parameters' values. The <b>Vars()</b> method does this. Called in a scalar
    context, it returns the parameter list as a tied hash reference. Changing a
    key changes the value of the parameter in the underlying CGI parameter list.
    Called in a list context, it returns the parameter list as an ordinary hash.
    This allows you to read the contents of the parameter list, but not to
    change it.</p>
<p class="Pp">When using this, the thing you must watch out for are multivalued
    CGI parameters. Because a hash cannot distinguish between scalar and list
    context, multivalued parameters will be returned as a packed string,
    separated by the &quot;\0&quot; (null) character. You must split this packed
    string in order to get at the individual values. This is the convention
    introduced long ago by Steve Brenner in his cgi-lib.pl module for perl
    version 4, and may be replaced in future versions with array references.</p>

Errors can occur while processing user input, particularly when processing
  uploaded files. When these errors occur, CGI will stop processing and return
  an empty parameter list. You can test for the existence and nature of errors
  using the <i></i><b><i>cgi_error()</i></b><i></i> function. The error messages
  are formatted as HTTP status codes. You can either incorporate the error text
  into a page, or use it as the value of the HTTP status:
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    if ( my $error = $q-&gt;cgi_error ) {
        print $q-&gt;header( -status =&gt; $error );
        print &quot;Error: $error&quot;;
        exit 0;
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">When using the function-oriented interface (see the next section),
    errors may only occur the first time you call
    <i></i><b><i>param()</i></b><i></i>. Be ready for this!</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Using_the_function-oriented_interface"><a class="permalink" href="#Using_the_function-oriented_interface">Using

To use the function-oriented interface, you must specify which CGI.pm routines
  or sets of routines to import into your script's namespace. There is a small
  overhead associated with this importation, but it isn't much.
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>

<p class="Pp">The listed methods will be imported into the current package; you

<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>

<p class="Pp">More frequently, you'll import common sets of functions by
    referring to the groups by name. All function sets are preceded with a
    &quot;:&quot; character as in &quot;:cgi&quot; (for CGI protocol handling
    methods).</p>
<p class="Pp">Here is a list of the function sets you can import:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>:cgi</b></dt>
  <dd>Import all CGI-handling methods, such as <b></b><b>param()</b><b></b>,
      <b></b> <b>path_info()</b><b></b> and the like.</dd>
  <dt><b>:all</b></dt>
  <dd>Import all the available methods. For the full list, see the CGI.pm code,
      where the variable <span class="Li">%EXPORT_TAGS</span> is defined. (N.B.
      the :cgi-lib imports will <b>not</b> be included in the :all import, you
      will have to import :cgi-lib to get those)</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Note that in the interests of execution speed CGI.pm does
    <b>not</b> use the standard Exporter syntax for specifying load symbols.
    This may change in the future.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Pragmas"><a class="permalink" href="#Pragmas">Pragmas</a></h2>
In addition to the function sets, there are a number of pragmas that you can
  import. Pragmas, which are always preceded by a hyphen, change the way that
  CGI.pm functions in various ways. Pragmas, function sets, and individual
  functions can all be imported in the same <b>use()</b> line. For example, the
  following use statement imports the cgi set of functions and enables debugging
  mode (pragma -debug):
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    use strict;
    use warninigs;
    use CGI qw/ :cgi -debug /;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The current list of pragmas is as follows:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>-no_undef_params</dt>
  <dd>This keeps CGI.pm from including undef params in the parameter list.</dd>
  <dt>-utf8</dt>
  <dd>This makes CGI.pm treat all parameters as text strings rather than binary
      strings (see perlunitut for the distinction), assuming UTF-8 for the
      encoding.
    <p class="Pp">CGI.pm does the decoding from the UTF-8 encoded input data,
        restricting this decoding to input text as distinct from binary upload
        data which are left untouched. Therefore, a ':utf8' layer must
        <b>not</b> be used on STDIN.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you do not use this option you can manually select which
        fields are expected to return utf-8 strings and convert them using code
        like this:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    use strict;
    use warnings;

    use CGI;
    use Encode qw/ decode /;

    my $cgi   = CGI-&gt;new;
    my $param = $cgi-&gt;param('foo');
    $param    = decode( 'UTF-8',$param );
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>-putdata_upload / -postdata_upload / -patchdata_upload</dt>
  <dd>Makes <span class="Li">&quot;$cgi-&gt;param('PUTDATA');&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;$cgi-&gt;param('PATCHDATA');&quot;</span>, and
      <span class="Li">&quot;$cgi-&gt;param('POSTDATA');&quot;</span> act like
      file uploads named PUTDATA, PATCHDATA, and POSTDATA. See &quot;Handling
      non-urlencoded arguments&quot; and &quot;Processing a file upload
      field&quot; PUTDATA/POSTDATA/PATCHDATA are also available via
    upload_hook.</dd>
  <dt>-nph</dt>
  <dd>This makes CGI.pm produce a header appropriate for an NPH (no parsed
      header) script. You may need to do other things as well to tell the server
      that the script is NPH. See the discussion of NPH scripts below.</dd>
  <dt>-newstyle_urls</dt>
  <dd>Separate the name=value pairs in CGI parameter query strings with
      semicolons rather than ampersands. For example:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    ?name=fred;age=24;favorite_color=3
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Semicolon-delimited query strings are always accepted, and
        will be emitted by <b>self_url()</b> and <b>query_string()</b>.
        newstyle_urls became the default in version 2.64.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>-oldstyle_urls</dt>
  <dd>Separate the name=value pairs in CGI parameter query strings with
      ampersands rather than semicolons. This is no longer the default.</dd>
  <dt>-no_debug</dt>
  <dd>This turns off the command-line processing features. If you want to run a
      CGI.pm script from the command line, and you don't want it to read CGI
      parameters from the command line or STDIN, then use this pragma:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
   use CGI qw/ -no_debug :standard /;
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>-debug</dt>
  <dd>This turns on full debugging. In addition to reading CGI arguments from
      the command-line processing, CGI.pm will pause and try to read arguments
      from STDIN, producing the message &quot;(offline mode: enter name=value
      pairs on standard input)&quot; features.

<h1 class="Sh" id="GENERATING_DYNAMIC_DOCUMENTS"><a class="permalink" href="#GENERATING_DYNAMIC_DOCUMENTS">GENERATING
  DYNAMIC DOCUMENTS</a></h1>
Most of CGI.pm's functions deal with creating documents on the fly. Generally
  you will produce the HTTP header first, followed by the document itself.
  CGI.pm provides functions for generating HTTP headers of various types.
<p class="Pp">Each of these functions produces a fragment of HTTP which you can
    print out directly so that it is processed by the browser, appended to a
    string, or saved to a file for later use.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Creating_a_standard_http_header"><a class="permalink" href="#Creating_a_standard_http_header">Creating
  a standard http header</a></h2>
Normally the first thing you will do in any CGI script is print out an HTTP
  header. This tells the browser what type of document to expect, and gives
  other optional information, such as the language, expiration date, and whether
  to cache the document. The header can also be manipulated for special
  purposes, such as server push and pay per view pages.
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    use strict;
    use warnings;

    use CGI;

    my $cgi = CGI-&gt;new;

    print $cgi-&gt;header;

        -or-

    print $cgi-&gt;header('image/gif');

        -or-

    print $cgi-&gt;header('text/html','204 No response');

        -or-

    print $cgi-&gt;header(
        -type       =&gt; 'image/gif',
        -nph        =&gt; 1,
        -status     =&gt; '402 Payment required',
        -expires    =&gt; '+3d',
        -cookie     =&gt; $cookie,
        -charset    =&gt; 'utf-8',
        -attachment =&gt; 'foo.gif',
        -Cost       =&gt; '$2.00'
    );
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><b>header()</b> returns the Content-type: header. You can provide
    your own MIME type if you choose, otherwise it defaults to text/html. An
    optional second parameter specifies the status code and a human-readable
    message. For example, you can specify 204, &quot;No response&quot; to create
    a script that tells the browser to do nothing at all. Note that RFC 2616
    expects the human-readable phase to be there as well as the numeric status
    code.</p>
<p class="Pp">The last example shows the named argument style for passing
    arguments to the CGI methods using named parameters. Recognized parameters
    are <b>-type</b>, <b>-status</b>, <b>-expires</b>, and <b>-cookie</b>. Any
    other named parameters will be stripped of their initial hyphens and turned
    into header fields, allowing you to specify any HTTP header you desire.
    Internal underscores will be turned into hyphens:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    print $cgi-&gt;header( -Content_length =&gt; 3002 );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Most browsers will not cache the output from CGI scripts. Every
    time the browser reloads the page, the script is invoked anew. You can
    change this behavior with the <b>-expires</b> parameter. When you specify an
    absolute or relative expiration interval with this parameter, some browsers
    and proxy servers will cache the script's output until the indicated
    expiration date. The following forms are all valid for the -expires
  field:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>

    Thursday, 25-Apr-2018 00:40:33 GMT    at the indicated time &amp; date
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The <b>-cookie</b> parameter generates a header that tells the
    browser to provide a &quot;magic cookie&quot; during all subsequent
    transactions with your script. Some cookies have a special format that
    includes interesting attributes such as expiration time. Use the
    <b>cookie()</b> method to create and retrieve session cookies.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>-nph</b> parameter, if set to a true value, will issue the
    correct headers to work with a NPH (no-parse-header) script. This is
    important to use with certain servers that expect all their scripts to be
    NPH.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>-charset</b> parameter can be used to control the character
    set sent to the browser. If not provided, defaults to ISO-8859-1. As a side
    effect, this sets the <b>charset()</b> method as well. <b>Note</b> that the
    default being ISO-8859-1 may not make sense for all content types, e.g.:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    Content-Type: image/gif; charset=ISO-8859-1
</pre>
<p class="Pp">In the above case you need to pass -charset =&gt; '' to prevent
    the default being used.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>-attachment</b> parameter can be used to turn the page into
    an attachment. Instead of displaying the page, some browsers will prompt the
    user to save it to disk. The value of the argument is the suggested name for
    the saved file. In order for this to work, you may have to set the
    <b>-type</b> to &quot;application/octet-stream&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>-p3p</b> parameter will add a P3P tag to the outgoing
    header. The parameter can be an arrayref or a space-delimited string of P3P
    tags. For example:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    print $cgi-&gt;header( -p3p =&gt; [ qw/ CAO DSP LAW CURa / ] );
    print $cgi-&gt;header( -p3p =&gt; 'CAO DSP LAW CURa' );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">In either case, the outgoing header will be formatted as:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    P3P: policyref=&quot;/w3c/p3p.xml&quot; cp=&quot;CAO DSP LAW CURa&quot;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">CGI.pm will accept valid multi-line headers when each line is
    separated with a CRLF value (&quot;\r\n&quot; on most platforms) followed by
    at least one space. For example:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    print $cgi-&gt;header( -ingredients =&gt; &quot;ham\r\n\seggs\r\n\sbacon&quot; );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Invalid multi-line header input will trigger in an exception. When
    multi-line headers are received, CGI.pm will always output them back as a
    single line, according to the folding rules of RFC 2616: the newlines will
    be removed, while the white space remains.</p>

<p class="Pp">Sometimes you don't want to produce a document yourself, but
    simply redirect the browser elsewhere, perhaps choosing a URL based on the
    time of day or the identity of the user.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>redirect()</b> method redirects the browser to a different
    URL. If you use redirection like this, you should <b>not</b> print out a
    header as well.</p>
<p class="Pp">You are advised to use full URLs (absolute with respect to current
    URL or even including the http: or ftp: part) in redirection requests as
    relative URLs are resolved by the user agent of the client so may not do
    what you want or expect them to do.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can also use named arguments:</p>

        -nph    =&gt; 1,
        -status =&gt; '301 Moved Permanently'
    );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">All names arguments recognized by <b>header()</b> are also
    recognized by <b>redirect()</b>. However, most HTTP headers, including those
    generated by -cookie and -target, are ignored by the browser.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>-nph</b> parameter, if set to a true value, will issue the
    correct headers to work with a NPH (no-parse-header) script. This is
    important to use with certain servers, such as Microsoft IIS, which expect
    all their scripts to be NPH.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>-status</b> parameter will set the status of the redirect.
    HTTP defines several different possible redirection status codes, and the
    default if not specified is 302, which means &quot;moved temporarily.&quot;
    You may change the status to another status code if you wish.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Processing_a_file_upload_field"><a class="permalink" href="#Processing_a_file_upload_field">Processing
  a file upload field</a></h2>
<i>Basics</i>
<p class="Pp">When the form is processed, you can retrieve an IO::File
    compatible handle for a file upload field like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    use autodie;

    # undef may be returned if it's not a valid file handle
    if ( my $io_handle = $q-&gt;upload('field_name') ) {
        open ( my $out_file,'&gt;&gt;','/usr/local/web/users/feedback' );
        while ( my $bytesread = $io_handle-&gt;read($buffer,1024) ) {
            print $out_file $buffer;
        }
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">In a list context, <b>upload()</b> will return an array of
    filehandles. This makes it possible to process forms that use the same name
    for multiple upload fields.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you want the entered file name for the file, you can just call
    <b>param()</b>:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    my $filename = $q-&gt;param('field_name');
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Different browsers will return slightly different things for the
    name. Some browsers return the filename only. Others return the full path to
    the file, using the path conventions of the user's machine. Regardless, the
    name returned is always the name of the file on the <i>user's</i> machine,
    and is unrelated to the name of the temporary file that CGI.pm creates
    during upload spooling (see below).</p>
<p class="Pp">When a file is uploaded the browser usually sends along some
    information along with it in the format of headers. The information usually
    includes the MIME content type. To retrieve this information, call
    <b>uploadInfo()</b>. It returns a reference to a hash containing all the
    document headers.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    my $filehandle = $q-&gt;upload( 'uploaded_file' );
    my $type       = $q-&gt;uploadInfo( $filehandle )-&gt;{'Content-Type'};
    if ( $type ne 'text/html' ) {
        die &quot;HTML FILES ONLY!&quot;;
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Note that you must use -&gt;upload or -&gt;param to get the
    file-handle to pass into uploadInfo as internally this is represented as a
    File::Temp object (which is what will be returned by -&gt;upload or
    -&gt;param). When using -&gt;Vars you will get the literal filename rather
    than the File::Temp object, which will not return anything when passed to
    uploadInfo. So don't use -&gt;Vars.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you are using a machine that recognizes &quot;text&quot; and
    &quot;binary&quot; data modes, be sure to understand when and how to use
    them (see the Camel book). Otherwise you may find that binary files are
    corrupted during file uploads.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Accessing the temp files directly</i></p>
<p class="Pp">When processing an uploaded file, CGI.pm creates a temporary file
    on your hard disk and passes you a file handle to that file. After you are
    finished with the file handle, CGI.pm unlinks (deletes) the temporary file.
    If you need to you can access the temporary file directly. You can access
    the temp file for a file upload by passing the file name to the
    <b>tmpFileName()</b> method:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    my $filehandle  = $q-&gt;upload( 'uploaded_file' );
    my $tmpfilename = $q-&gt;tmpFileName( $filehandle );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">As with -&gt;uploadInfo, using the reference returned by
    -&gt;upload or -&gt;param is preferred, although unlike -&gt;uploadInfo,
    plain filenames also work if possible for backwards compatibility.</p>
<p class="Pp">The temporary file will be deleted automatically when your program
    exits unless you manually rename it or set
    <span class="Li">$CGI::UNLINK_TMP_FILES</span> to 0. On some operating
    systems (such as Windows NT), you will need to close the temporary file's
    filehandle before your program exits. Otherwise the attempt to delete the
    temporary file will fail.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Changes in temporary file handling (v4.05+)</i></p>
<p class="Pp">CGI.pm had its temporary file handling significantly refactored,
    this logic is now all deferred to File::Temp (which is wrapped in a
    compatibility object, CGI::File::Temp - <b>DO NOT USE THIS PACKAGE
    DIRECTLY</b>). As a consequence the PRIVATE_TEMPFILES variable has been
    removed along with deprecation of the private_tempfiles routine and
    <b>complete</b> removal of the CGITempFile package. The
    <span class="Li">$CGITempFile::TMPDIRECTORY</span> is no longer used to set
    the temp directory, refer to the perldoc for File::Temp if you want to
    override the default settings in that package (the TMPDIR env variable is
    still available on some platforms). For Windows platforms the temporary
    directory order remains as before: TEMP &gt; TMP &gt; WINDIR ( &gt; TMPDIR )
    so if you have any of these in use in existing scripts they should still
    work.</p>
<p class="Pp">The Fh package still exists but does nothing, the CGI::File::Temp
    class is a subclass of both File::Temp and the empty Fh package, so if you
    have any code that checks that the filehandle isa Fh this should still
  work.</p>
<p class="Pp">When you get the internal file handle you will receive a
    File::Temp object, this should be transparent as File::Temp isa IO::Handle
    and isa IO::Seekable meaning it behaves as previously. If you are doing
    anything out of the ordinary with regards to temp files you should test your
    code before deploying this update and refer to the File::Temp documentation
    for more information.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Handling interrupted file uploads</i></p>
<p class="Pp">There are occasionally problems involving parsing the uploaded
    file. This usually happens when the user presses &quot;Stop&quot; before the
    upload is finished. In this case, CGI.pm will return undef for the name of
    the uploaded file and set <i></i><b><i>cgi_error()</i></b><i></i> to the
    string &quot;400 Bad request (malformed multipart POST)&quot;. This error
    message is designed so that you can incorporate it into a status code to be
    sent to the browser. Example:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    my $file = $q-&gt;upload( 'uploaded_file' );
    if ( !$file &amp;&amp; $q-&gt;cgi_error ) {
        print $q-&gt;header( -status =&gt; $q-&gt;cgi_error );
        exit 0;
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><i>Progress bars for file uploads and avoiding temp files</i></p>
<p class="Pp">CGI.pm gives you low-level access to file upload management
    through a file upload hook. You can use this feature to completely turn off
    the temp file storage of file uploads, or potentially write your own file
    upload progress meter.</p>
<p class="Pp">This is much like the UPLOAD_HOOK facility available in
    Apache::Request, with the exception that the first argument to the callback
    is an Apache::Upload object, here it's the remote filename.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    my $q = CGI-&gt;new( \&amp;hook [,$data [,$use_tempfile]] );

    sub hook {
        my ( $filename, $buffer, $bytes_read, $data ) = @_;
        print &quot;Read $bytes_read bytes of $filename\n&quot;;
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">$data</span> field is optional; it lets you
    pass configuration information (e.g. a database handle) to your hook
    callback.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">$use_tempfile</span> field is a flag that
    lets you turn on and off CGI.pm's use of a temporary disk-based file during
    file upload. If you set this to a FALSE value (default true) then
    <span class="Li">$q</span>-&gt;param('uploaded_file') will no longer work,
    and the only way to get at the uploaded data is via the hook you
  provide.</p>
<p class="Pp">If using the function-oriented interface, call the
    <b>CGI::upload_hook()</b> method before calling <b>param()</b> or any other
    CGI functions:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    CGI::upload_hook( \&amp;hook [,$data [,$use_tempfile]] );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This method is not exported by default. You will have to import it
    explicitly if you wish to use it without the CGI:: prefix.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Troubleshooting file uploads on Windows</i></p>
<p class="Pp">If you are using CGI.pm on a Windows platform and find that binary
    files get slightly larger when uploaded but that text files remain the same,
    then you have forgotten to activate binary mode on the output filehandle. Be
    sure to call <b>binmode()</b> on any handle that you create to write the
    uploaded file to disk.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Older ways to process file uploads</i></p>
<p class="Pp">This section is here for completeness. if you are building a new
    application with CGI.pm, you can skip it.</p>
<p class="Pp">The original way to process file uploads with CGI.pm was to use
    <b>param()</b>. The value it returns has a dual nature as both a file name
    and a lightweight filehandle. This dual nature is problematic if you
    following the recommended practice of having <span class="Li">&quot;use
    strict&quot;</span> in your code. perl will complain when you try to use a
    string as a filehandle. More seriously, it is possible for the remote user
    to type garbage into the upload field, in which case what you get from
    <b>param()</b> is not a filehandle at all, but a string.</p>
<p class="Pp">To solve this problem the <b>upload()</b> method was added, which
    always returns a lightweight filehandle. This generally works well, but will
    have trouble interoperating with some other modules because the file handle
    is not derived from IO::File. So that brings us to current recommendation
    given above, which is to call the <b>handle()</b> method on the file handle
    returned by <b>upload()</b>. That upgrades the handle to an IO::File. It's a
    big win for compatibility for a small penalty of loading IO::File the first
    time you call it.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="HTTP_COOKIES"><a class="permalink" href="#HTTP_COOKIES">HTTP
  COOKIES</a></h1>
CGI.pm has several methods that support cookies.
<p class="Pp">A cookie is a name=value pair much like the named parameters in a
    CGI query string. CGI scripts create one or more cookies and send them to
    the browser in the HTTP header. The browser maintains a list of cookies that
    belong to a particular Web server, and returns them to the CGI script during
    subsequent interactions.</p>
<p class="Pp">In addition to the required name=value pair, each cookie has
    several optional attributes:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>1. an expiration time</dt>
  <dd>This is a time/date string (in a special GMT format) that indicates when a
      cookie expires. The cookie will be saved and returned to your script until
      this expiration date is reached if the user exits the browser and restarts
      it. If an expiration date isn't specified, the cookie will remain active
      until the user quits the browser.</dd>
  <dt>2. a domain</dt>
  <dd>This is a partial or complete domain name for which the cookie is valid.
      The browser will return the cookie to any host that matches the partial
      domain name. For example, if you specify a domain name of
      &quot;.capricorn.com&quot;, then the browser will return the cookie to Web
      servers running on any of the machines &quot;www.capricorn.com&quot;,
      &quot;www2.capricorn.com&quot;, &quot;feckless.capricorn.com&quot;, etc.
      Domain names must contain at least two periods to prevent attempts to
      match on top level domains like &quot;.edu&quot;. If no domain is
      specified, then the browser will only return the cookie to servers on the
      host the cookie originated from.</dd>
  <dt>3. a path</dt>
  <dd>If you provide a cookie path attribute, the browser will check it against
      your script's URL before returning the cookie. For example, if you specify
      the path &quot;/cgi-bin&quot;, then the cookie will be returned to each of
      the scripts &quot;/cgi-bin/tally.pl&quot;, &quot;/cgi-bin/order.pl&quot;,
      and &quot;/cgi-bin/customer_service/complain.pl&quot;, but not to the
      script &quot;/cgi-private/site_admin.pl&quot;. By default, path is set to
      &quot;/&quot;, which causes the cookie to be sent to any CGI script on
      your site.</dd>
  <dt>4. a &quot;secure&quot; flag</dt>
  <dd>If the &quot;secure&quot; attribute is set, the cookie will only be sent
      to your script if the CGI request is occurring on a secure channel, such
      as SSL.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The interface to HTTP cookies is the <b></b><b>cookie()</b><b></b>
    method:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    my $cookie = $q-&gt;cookie(
        -name    =&gt; 'sessionID',
        -value   =&gt; 'xyzzy',
        -expires =&gt; '+1h',
        -path    =&gt; '/cgi-bin/database',
        -domain  =&gt; '.capricorn.org',
        -secure  =&gt; 1
    );

    print $q-&gt;header( -cookie =&gt; $cookie );
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><b></b><b>cookie()</b><b></b> creates a new cookie. Its parameters
    include:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>-name</b></dt>
  <dd>The name of the cookie (required). This can be any string at all. Although
      browsers limit their cookie names to non-whitespace alphanumeric
      characters, CGI.pm removes this restriction by escaping and unescaping
      cookies behind the scenes.</dd>
  <dt><b>-value</b></dt>
  <dd>The value of the cookie. This can be any scalar value, array reference, or
      even hash reference. For example, you can store an entire hash into a
      cookie this way:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    my $cookie = $q-&gt;cookie(
        -name  =&gt; 'family information',
        -value =&gt; \%childrens_ages
    );
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>-path</b></dt>
  <dd>The optional partial path for which this cookie will be valid, as
      described above.</dd>
  <dt><b>-domain</b></dt>
  <dd>The optional partial domain for which this cookie will be valid, as
      described above.</dd>
  <dt><b>-expires</b></dt>
  <dd>The optional expiration date for this cookie. The format is as described
      in the section on the <b></b><b>header()</b><b></b> method:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    &quot;+1h&quot;  one hour from now
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>-secure</b></dt>
  <dd>If set to true, this cookie will only be used within a secure SSL
    session.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The cookie created by <b>cookie()</b> must be incorporated into
    the HTTP header within the string returned by the <b>header()</b>
  method:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    use strict;
    use warnings;

    use CGI;

    my $q      = CGI-&gt;new;
    my $cookie = ...
    print $q-&gt;header( -cookie =&gt; $cookie );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">To create multiple cookies, give <b>header()</b> an array
    reference:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    my $cookie1 = $q-&gt;cookie(
        -name  =&gt; 'riddle_name',
        -value =&gt; &quot;The Sphynx's Question&quot;
    );

    my $cookie2 = $q-&gt;cookie(
        -name  =&gt; 'answers',
        -value =&gt; \%answers
    );

    print $q-&gt;header( -cookie =&gt; [ $cookie1,$cookie2 ] );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">To retrieve a cookie, request it by name by calling
    <b>cookie()</b> method without the <b>-value</b> parameter. This example
    uses the object-oriented form:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    my $riddle  = $q-&gt;cookie('riddle_name');
    my %answers = $q-&gt;cookie('answers');
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Cookies created with a single scalar value, such as the
    &quot;riddle_name&quot; cookie, will be returned in that form. Cookies with
    array and hash values can also be retrieved.</p>
<p class="Pp">The cookie and CGI namespaces are separate. If you have a
    parameter named 'answers' and a cookie named 'answers', the values retrieved
    by <b>param()</b> and <b>cookie()</b> are independent of each other.
    However, it's simple to turn a CGI parameter into a cookie, and
  vice-versa:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    # turn a CGI parameter into a cookie
    my $c = cookie( -name =&gt; 'answers',-value =&gt; [$q-&gt;param('answers')] );
    # vice-versa
    $q-&gt;param( -name =&gt; 'answers',-value =&gt; [ $q-&gt;cookie('answers')] );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If you call <b>cookie()</b> without any parameters, it will return
    a list of the names of all cookies passed to your script:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    my @cookies = $q-&gt;cookie();
</pre>

    <p class="Pp">Note that the capitalization changed between version 2.43 and
        2.44 in order to avoid conflict with perl's <b>accept()</b>
      function.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b></b><b>raw_cookie()</b><b></b></dt>
  <dd>Returns the HTTP_COOKIE variable. Cookies have a special format, and this
      method call just returns the raw form (?cookie dough). See <b>cookie()</b>
      for ways of setting and retrieving cooked cookies.
    <p class="Pp">Called with no parameters, <b>raw_cookie()</b> returns the
        packed cookie structure. You can separate it into individual cookies by
        splitting on the character sequence &quot;; &quot;. Called with the name
        of a cookie, retrieves the <b>unescaped</b> form of the cookie. You can
        use the regular <b>cookie()</b> method to get the names, or use the
        <b>raw_fetch()</b> method from the CGI::Cookie module.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b></b><b>env_query_string()</b><b></b></dt>
  <dd>Returns the QUERY_STRING variable, note that this is the original value as
      set in the environment by the webserver and (possibly) not the same value
      as returned by <b>query_string()</b>, which represents the object
    state</dd>
  <dt><b></b><b>user_agent()</b><b></b></dt>
  <dd>Returns the HTTP_USER_AGENT variable. If you give this method a single
      argument, it will attempt to pattern match on it, allowing you to do
      something like user_agent(Mozilla);</dd>
  <dt><b></b><b>path_info()</b><b></b></dt>
  <dd>Returns additional path information from the script URL. E.G. fetching
      /cgi-bin/your_script/additional/stuff will result in <b>path_info()</b>
      returning &quot;/additional/stuff&quot;.
    <p class="Pp">NOTE: The Microsoft Internet Information Server is broken with
        respect to additional path information. If you use the perl DLL library,
        the IIS server will attempt to execute the additional path information
        as a perl script. If you use the ordinary file associations mapping, the
        path information will be present in the environment, but incorrect. The
        best thing to do is to avoid using additional path information in CGI
        scripts destined for use with IIS. A best attempt has been made to make
        CGI.pm do the right thing.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="USING_NPH_SCRIPTS"><a class="permalink" href="#USING_NPH_SCRIPTS">USING
  NPH SCRIPTS</a></h1>
NPH, or &quot;no-parsed-header&quot;, scripts bypass the server completely by
  sending the complete HTTP header directly to the browser. This has slight
  performance benefits, but is of most use for taking advantage of HTTP
  extensions that are not directly supported by your server, such as server push
  and PICS headers.
<p class="Pp">Servers use a variety of conventions for designating CGI scripts
    as NPH. Many Unix servers look at the beginning of the script's name for the
    prefix &quot;nph-&quot;. The Macintosh WebSTAR server and Microsoft's
    Internet Information Server, in contrast, try to decide whether a program is
    an NPH script by examining the first line of script output.</p>
<p class="Pp">CGI.pm supports NPH scripts with a special NPH mode. When in this
    mode, CGI.pm will output the necessary extra header information when the
    <b>header()</b> and <b>redirect()</b> methods are called.</p>
<p class="Pp">The Microsoft Internet Information Server requires NPH mode. As of
    version 2.30, CGI.pm will automatically detect when the script is running
    under IIS and put itself into this mode. You do not need to do this
    manually, although it won't hurt anything if you do.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>In the <b>use</b> statement</dt>

<h1 class="Sh" id="SERVER_PUSH"><a class="permalink" href="#SERVER_PUSH">SERVER
  PUSH</a></h1>
CGI.pm provides four simple functions for producing multipart documents of the
  type needed to implement server push. These functions were graciously provided
  by Ed Jordan &lt;ed@fidalgo.net&gt;. To import these into your namespace, you
  must import the &quot;:push&quot; set. You are also advised to put the script
  into NPH mode and to set $| to 1 to avoid buffering problems.
<p class="Pp">Here is a simple script that demonstrates server push:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    #!/usr/bin/env perl

    use strict;
    use warnings;

    use CGI qw/:push -nph/;

    $| = 1;
    print multipart_init( -boundary=&gt;'----here we go!' );
    for (0 .. 4) {
        print multipart_start( -type=&gt;'text/plain' ),
            &quot;The current time is &quot;,scalar( localtime ),&quot;\n&quot;;
        if ($_ &lt; 4) {
            print multipart_end();
        } else {
            print multipart_final();
        }
        sleep 1;
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This script initializes server push by calling
    <b></b><b>multipart_init()</b><b></b>. It then enters a loop in which it
    begins a new multipart section by calling
    <b></b><b>multipart_start()</b><b></b>, prints the current local time, and
    ends a multipart section with <b></b><b>multipart_end()</b><b></b>. It then
    sleeps a second, and begins again. On the final iteration, it ends the
    multipart section with <b></b><b>multipart_final()</b><b></b> rather than
    with <b></b><b>multipart_end()</b><b></b>.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>multipart_init()</b></dt>
  <dd><span class="Li"></span>
    <pre>
    multipart_init( -boundary =&gt; $boundary, -charset =&gt; $charset );
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Initialize the multipart system. The -boundary argument
        specifies what MIME boundary string to use to separate parts of the
        document. If not provided, CGI.pm chooses a reasonable boundary for
      you.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The -charset provides the character set, if not provided this

    <p class="Pp">End a part. You must remember to call <b>multipart_end()</b>
        once for each <b>multipart_start()</b>, except at the end of the last
        part of the multipart document when <b>multipart_final()</b> should be
        called instead of <b>multipart_end()</b>.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="AVOIDING_DENIAL_OF_SERVICE_ATTACKS"><a class="permalink" href="#AVOIDING_DENIAL_OF_SERVICE_ATTACKS">AVOIDING
  DENIAL OF SERVICE ATTACKS</a></h1>
A potential problem with CGI.pm is that, by default, it attempts to process form
  POSTings no matter how large they are. A wily hacker could attack your site by
  sending a CGI script a huge POST of many gigabytes. CGI.pm will attempt to
  read the entire POST into a variable, growing hugely in size until it runs out
  of memory. While the script attempts to allocate the memory the system may
  slow down dramatically. This is a form of denial of service attack.
<p class="Pp">Another possible attack is for the remote user to force CGI.pm to
    accept a huge file upload. CGI.pm will accept the upload and store it in a
    temporary directory even if your script doesn't expect to receive an
    uploaded file. CGI.pm will delete the file automatically when it terminates,
    but in the meantime the remote user may have filled up the server's disk
    space, causing problems for other programs.</p>
<p class="Pp">The best way to avoid denial of service attacks is to limit the
    amount of memory, CPU time and disk space that CGI scripts can use. Some Web
    servers come with built-in facilities to accomplish this. In other cases,
    you can use the shell <i>limit</i> or <i>ulimit</i> commands to put ceilings
    on CGI resource usage.</p>
<p class="Pp">CGI.pm also has some simple built-in protections against denial of
    service attacks, but you must activate them before you can use them. These
    take the form of two global variables in the CGI name space:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b></b><b>$CGI::POST_MAX</b><b></b></dt>
  <dd>If set to a non-negative integer, this variable puts a ceiling on the size
      of POSTings, in bytes. If CGI.pm detects a POST that is greater than the
      ceiling, it will immediately exit with an error message. This value will
      affect both ordinary POSTs and multipart POSTs, meaning that it limits the
      maximum size of file uploads as well. You should set this to a reasonably
      high value, such as 10 megabytes.</dd>
  <dt><b></b><b>$CGI::DISABLE_UPLOADS</b><b></b></dt>
  <dd>If set to a non-zero value, this will disable file uploads completely.
      Other fill-out form values will work as usual.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">To use these variables, set the variable at the top of the script,
    right after the &quot;use&quot; statement:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    #!/usr/bin/env perl

    use strict;
    use warnings;

    use CGI;

    $CGI::POST_MAX = 1024 * 1024 * 10;  # max 10MB posts
    $CGI::DISABLE_UPLOADS = 1;          # no uploads
</pre>
<p class="Pp">An attempt to send a POST larger than
    <span class="Li">$POST_MAX</span> bytes will cause
    <i></i><b><i>param()</i></b> <i></i> to return an empty CGI parameter list.
    You can test for this event by checking
    <i></i><b><i>cgi_error()</i></b><i></i>, either after you create the CGI
    object or, if you are using the function-oriented interface, call
    &lt;<b>param()</b>&gt; for the first time. If the POST was intercepted, then
    <b>cgi_error()</b> will return the message &quot;413 POST too
  large&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">This error message is actually defined by the HTTP protocol, and
    is designed to be returned to the browser as the CGI script's status code.
    For example:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    my $uploaded_file = $q-&gt;param('upload');
    if ( !$uploaded_file &amp;&amp; $q-&gt;cgi_error() ) {
        print $q-&gt;header( -status =&gt; $q-&gt;cgi_error() );
        exit 0;
   }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">However it isn't clear that any browser currently knows what to do
    with this status code. It might be better just to create a page that warns
    the user of the problem.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="COMPATIBILITY_WITH_CGI_-LIB.PL"><a class="permalink" href="#COMPATIBILITY_WITH_CGI_-LIB.PL">COMPATIBILITY
  WITH CGI-LIB.PL</a></h1>
To make it easier to port existing programs that use cgi-lib.pl the
  compatibility routine &quot;ReadParse&quot; is provided. Porting is simple:
<p class="Pp">OLD VERSION</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    require &quot;cgi-lib.pl&quot;;
    &amp;ReadParse;
    print &quot;The value of the antique is $in{antique}.\n&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">NEW VERSION</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    use CGI;
    CGI::ReadParse();
    print &quot;The value of the antique is $in{antique}.\n&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">CGI.pm's <b>ReadParse()</b> routine creates a tied variable named
    <span class="Li">%in</span>, which can be accessed to obtain the query
    variables. Like ReadParse, you can also provide your own variable.
    Infrequently used features of ReadParse, such as the creation of
    <span class="Li">@in</span> and <span class="Li">$in</span> variables, are
    not supported.</p>
<p class="Pp">Once you use ReadParse, you can retrieve the query object itself
    this way:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    my $q = $in{CGI};
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This allows you to start using the more interesting features of
    CGI.pm without rewriting your old scripts from scratch.</p>
<p class="Pp">An even simpler way to mix cgi-lib calls with CGI.pm calls is to
    import both the <span class="Li">&quot;:cgi-lib&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;:standard&quot;</span> method:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    use CGI qw(:cgi-lib :standard);
    &amp;ReadParse;
    print &quot;The price of your purchase is $in{price}.\n&quot;;
