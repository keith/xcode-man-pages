<h1 class="Sh" id="SHELL_BUILTIN_COMMANDS"><a class="permalink" href="#SHELL_BUILTIN_COMMANDS">SHELL
  BUILTIN COMMANDS</a></h1>
Some shell builtin commands take options as described in individual entries;
  these are often referred to in the list below as `<b>flags</b>' to avoid
  confusion with shell options, which may also have an effect on the behaviour
  of builtin commands. In this introductory section, `<b>option</b>' always has
  the meaning of an option to a command that should be familiar to most command
  line users.
<p class="Pp">Typically, options are single letters preceded by a hyphen
    (<b>-</b>). Options that take an argument accept it either immediately
    following the option letter or after white space, for example `<b>print -C3
    {1..9}</b>' or `<b>print -C 3 {1..9}</b>' are equivalent. Arguments to
    options are not the same as arguments to the command; the documentation
    indicates which is which. Options that do not take an argument may be
    combined in a single word, for example `<b>print -rca -- *</b>' and
    `<b>print -r -c -a -- *</b>' are equivalent.</p>
<p class="Pp">Some shell builtin commands also take options that begin with
    `<b>+</b>' instead of `<b>-</b>'. The list below makes clear which commands
    these are.</p>
<p class="Pp">Options (together with their individual arguments, if any) must
    appear in a group before any non-option arguments; once the first non-option
    argument has been found, option processing is terminated.</p>
<p class="Pp">All builtin commands other than `<b>echo</b>' and precommand
    modifiers, even those that have no options, can be given the argument
    `<b>-</b><b>-</b>' to terminate option processing. This indicates that the
    following words are non-option arguments, but is otherwise ignored. This is
    useful in cases where arguments to the command may begin with `<b>-</b>'.
    For historical reasons, most builtin commands (including `<b>echo</b>') also
    recognize a single `<b>-</b>' in a separate word for this purpose; note that
    this is less standard and use of `<b>-</b><b>-</b>' is recommended.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>-</b> <i>simple command</i></dt>
  <dd>See the section `Precommand Modifiers' in <i>zshmisc</i>(1).</dd>
  <dt><b>.</b> <i>file</i> [ <i>arg</i> ... ]</dt>
  <dd>Read commands from <i>file</i> and execute them in the current shell
      environment.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">If <i>file</i> does not contain a slash, or if <b>PATH_DIRS</b> is
    set, the shell looks in the components of <b>$path</b> to find the directory
    containing <i>file</i>. Files in the current directory are not read unless
    `<b>.</b>' appears somewhere in <b>$path</b>. If a file named
    `<i>file</i><b>.zwc</b>' is found, is newer than <i>file</i>, and is the
    compiled form (created with the <b>zcompile</b> builtin) of <i>file</i>,
    then commands are read from that file instead of <i>file</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">If any arguments <i>arg</i> are given, they become the positional
    parameters; the old positional parameters are restored when the <i>file</i>
    is done executing. However, if no arguments are given, the positional
    parameters remain those of the calling context, and no restoring is
  done.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <i>file</i> was not found the return status is 127; if
    <i>file</i> was found but contained a syntax error the return status is 126;
    else the return status is the exit status of the last command executed.</p>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>:</b> [ <i>arg</i> ... ]</dt>
  <dd>This command does nothing, although normal argument expansions is
      performed which may have effects on shell parameters. A zero exit status
      is returned.</dd>
  <dt><b>alias</b> [ {<b>+</b>|<b>-</b>}<b>gmrsL</b> ] [
    <i>name</i>[<b>=</b><i>value</i>] ... ]</dt>
  <dd>For each <i>name</i> with a corresponding <i>value</i>, define an alias
      with that value. A trailing space in <i>value</i> causes the next word to
      be checked for alias expansion. If the <b>-g</b> flag is present, define a
      global alias; global aliases are expanded even if they do not occur in
      command position.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">If the <b>-s</b> flag is present, define a suffix alias: if the
    command word on a command line is in the form
    `<i>text</i><b>.</b><i>name</i>', where <i>text</i> is any non-empty string,
    it is replaced by the text `<i>value</i> <i>text</i><b>.</b><i>name</i>'.
    Note that <i>name</i> is treated as a literal string, not a pattern. A
    trailing space in <i>value</i> is not special in this case. For example,</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b>alias -s ps='gv --'</b>
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">will cause the command `<b>*.ps</b>' to be expanded to `<b>gv --
    *.ps</b>'. As alias expansion is carried out earlier than globbing, the
    `<b>*.ps</b>' will then be expanded. Suffix aliases constitute a different
    name space from other aliases (so in the above example it is still possible
    to create an alias for the command <b>ps</b>) and the two sets are never
    listed together.</p>
<p class="Pp">For each <i>name</i> with no <i>value</i>, print the value of
    <i>name</i>, if any. With no arguments, print all currently defined aliases
    other than suffix aliases. If the <b>-m</b> flag is given the arguments are
    taken as patterns (they should be quoted to preserve them from being
    interpreted as glob patterns), and the aliases matching these patterns are
    printed. When printing aliases and one of the <b>-g</b>, <b>-r</b> or
    <b>-s</b> flags is present, restrict the printing to global, regular or
    suffix aliases, respectively; a regular alias is one which is neither a
    global nor a suffix alias. Using `<b>+</b>' instead of `<b>-</b>', or ending
    the option list with a single `<b>+</b>', prevents the values of the aliases
    from being printed.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the <b>-L</b> flag is present, then print each alias in a
    manner suitable for putting in a startup script. The exit status is nonzero
    if a <i>name</i> (with no <i>value</i>) is given for which no alias has been
    defined.</p>
<p class="Pp">For more on aliases, include common problems, see the section
    ALIASING in <i>zshmisc</i>(1).</p>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>autoload</b> [ {<b>+</b>|<b>-</b>}<b>RTUXdkmrtWz</b> ] [ <b>-w</b> ] [
    <i>name</i> ... ]</dt>
  <dd>See the section `Autoloading Functions' in <i>zshmisc</i>(1) for full
      details. The <b>fpath</b> parameter will be searched to find the function
      definition when the function is first referenced.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">If <i>name</i> consists of an absolute path, the function is
    defined to load from the file given (searching as usual for dump files in
    the given location). The name of the function is the basename (non-directory
    part) of the file. It is normally an error if the function is not found in
    the given location; however, if the option <b>-d</b> is given, searching for
    the function defaults to <b>$fpath</b>. If a function is loaded by absolute
    path, any functions loaded from it that are marked for <b>autoload</b>
    without an absolute path have the load path of the parent function
    temporarily prepended to <b>$fpath</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the option <b>-r</b> or <b>-R</b> is given, the function is
    searched for immediately and the location is recorded internally for use
    when the function is executed; a relative path is expanded using the value
    of <b>$PWD</b>. This protects against a change to <b>$fpath</b> after the
    call to <b>autoload</b>. With <b>-r</b>, if the function is not found, it is
    silently left unresolved until execution; with <b>-R</b>, an error message
    is printed and command processing aborted immediately the search fails, i.e.
    at the <b>autoload</b> command rather than at function execution..</p>
<p class="Pp">The flag <b>-X</b> may be used only inside a shell function. It
    causes the calling function to be marked for autoloading and then
    immediately loaded and executed, with the current array of positional
    parameters as arguments. This replaces the previous definition of the
    function. If no function definition is found, an error is printed and the
    function remains undefined and marked for autoloading. If an argument is
    given, it is used as a directory (i.e. it does not include the name of the
    function) in which the function is to be found; this may be combined with
    the <b>-d</b> option to allow the function search to default to
    <b>$fpath</b> if it is not in the given location.</p>
<p class="Pp">The flag <b>+X</b> attempts to load each <i>name</i> as an
    autoloaded function, but does <i>not</i> execute it. The exit status is zero
    (success) if the function was not previously defined <i>and</i> a definition
    for it was found. This does <i>not</i> replace any existing definition of
    the function. The exit status is nonzero (failure) if the function was
    already defined or when no definition was found. In the latter case the
    function remains undefined and marked for autoloading. If ksh-style
    autoloading is enabled, the function created will contain the contents of
    the file plus a call to the function itself appended to it, thus giving
    normal ksh autoloading behaviour on the first call to the function. If the
    <b>-m</b> flag is also given each <i>name</i> is treated as a pattern and
    all functions already marked for autoload that match the pattern are
  loaded.</p>
<p class="Pp">With the <b>-t</b> flag, turn on execution tracing; with
    <b>-T</b>, turn on execution tracing only for the current function, turning
    it off on entry to any called functions that do not also have tracing
    enabled.</p>
<p class="Pp">With the <b>-U</b> flag, alias expansion is suppressed when the
    function is loaded.</p>
<p class="Pp">With the <b>-w</b> flag, the <i>name</i>s are taken as names of
    files compiled with the <b>zcompile</b> builtin, and all functions defined
    in them are marked for autoloading.</p>
<p class="Pp">The flags <b>-z</b> and <b>-k</b> mark the function to be
    autoloaded using the zsh or ksh style, as if the option <b>KSH_AUTOLOAD</b>
    were unset or were set, respectively. The flags override the setting of the
    option at the time the function is loaded.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that the <b>autoload</b> command makes no attempt to ensure
    the shell options set during the loading or execution of the file have any
    particular value. For this, the <b>emulate</b> command can be used:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b>emulate zsh -c 'autoload -Uz </b><i>func</i><b>'</b><i></i>
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">arranges that when <i>func</i> is loaded the shell is in native
    <b>zsh</b> emulation, and this emulation is also applied when <i>func</i> is
    run.</p>
<p class="Pp">Some of the functions of <b>autoload</b> are also provided by
    <b>functions</b> <b>-u</b> or <b>functions -U</b>, but <b>autoload</b> is a
    more comprehensive interface.</p>

      not specified. If <i>arg</i> is `<b>-</b>', change to the previous
      directory.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">Otherwise, if <i>arg</i> begins with a slash, attempt to change to
    the directory given by <i>arg</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <i>arg</i> does not begin with a slash, the behaviour depends
    on whether the current directory `<b>.</b>' occurs in the list of
    directories contained in the shell parameter <b>cdpath</b>. If it does not,
    first attempt to change to the directory <i>arg</i> under the current
    directory, and if that fails but <b>cdpath</b> is set and contains at least
    one element attempt to change to the directory <i>arg</i> under each
    component of <b>cdpath</b> in turn until successful. If `<b>.</b>' occurs in
    <b>cdpath</b>, then <b>cdpath</b> is searched strictly in order so that
    `<b>.</b>' is only tried at the appropriate point.</p>
<p class="Pp">The order of testing <b>cdpath</b> is modified if the option
    <b>POSIX_CD</b> is set, as described in the documentation for the
  option.</p>
<p class="Pp">If no directory is found, the option <b>CDABLE_VARS</b> is set,
    and a parameter named <i>arg</i> exists whose value begins with a slash,
    treat its value as the directory. In that case, the parameter is added to
    the named directory hash table.</p>
<p class="Pp">The second form of <b>cd</b> substitutes the string <i>new</i> for
    the string <i>old</i> in the name of the current directory, and tries to
    change to this new directory.</p>
<p class="Pp">The third form of <b>cd</b> extracts an entry from the directory
    stack, and changes to that directory. An argument of the form
    `<b>+</b><i>n</i>' identifies a stack entry by counting from the left of the
    list shown by the <b>dirs</b> command, starting with zero. An argument of
    the form `<b>-</b><i>n</i>' counts from the right. If the <b>PUSHD_MINUS</b>
    option is set, the meanings of `<b>+</b>' and `<b>-</b>' in this context are
    swapped. If the <b>POSIX_CD</b> option is set, this form of <b>cd</b> is not
    recognised and will be interpreted as the first form.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the <b>-q</b> (quiet) option is specified, the hook function
    <b>chpwd</b> and the functions in the array <b>chpwd_functions</b> are not
    called. This is useful for calls to <b>cd</b> that do not change the
    environment seen by an interactive user.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the <b>-s</b> option is specified, <b>cd</b> refuses to change
    the current directory if the given pathname contains symlinks. If the
    <b>-P</b> option is given or the <b>CHASE_LINKS</b> option is set, symbolic
    links are resolved to their true values. If the <b>-L</b> option is given
    symbolic links are retained in the directory (and not resolved) regardless
    of the state of the <b>CHASE_LINKS</b> option.</p>

  <dd>The simple command argument is taken as an external command instead of a
      function or builtin and is executed. If the <b>POSIX_BUILTINS</b> option
      is set, builtins will also be executed but certain special properties of
      them are suppressed. The <b>-p</b> flag causes a default path to be
      searched instead of that in <b>$path</b>. With the <b>-v</b> flag,
      <b>command</b> is similar to <b>whence</b> and with <b>-V</b>, it is

  <dd>Temporarily disable the <i>name</i>d hash table elements or patterns. The

</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">With single argument set up zsh options to emulate the specified
    shell as much as possible. <b>csh</b> will never be fully emulated. If the
    argument is not one of the shells listed above, <b>zsh</b> will be used as a
    default; more precisely, the tests performed on the argument are the same as
    those used to determine the emulation at startup based on the shell name,
    see the section COMPATIBILITY in <i>zsh</i>(1) . In addition to setting
    shell options, the command also restores the pristine state of pattern
    enables, as if all patterns had been enabled using <b>enable -p</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the <b>emulate</b> command occurs inside a function that has
    been marked for execution tracing with <b>functions -t</b> then the
    <b>xtrace</b> option will be turned on regardless of emulation mode or other
    options. Note that code executed inside the function by the <b>.</b>,
    <b>source</b>, or <b>eval</b> commands is not considered to be running
    directly from the function, hence does not provoke this behaviour.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the <b>-R</b> switch is given, all settable options are reset
    to their default value corresponding to the specified emulation mode, except
    for certain options describing the interactive environment; otherwise, only
    those options likely to cause portability problems in scripts and functions
    are altered. If the <b>-L</b> switch is given, the options
    <b>LOCAL_OPTIONS</b>, <b>LOCAL_PATTERNS</b> and <b>LOCAL_TRAPS</b> will be
    set as well, causing the effects of the <b>emulate</b> command and any
    <b>setopt</b>, <b>disable -p</b> or <b>enable -p</b>, and <b>trap</b>
    commands to be local to the immediately surrounding shell function, if any;
    normally these options are turned off in all emulation modes except
    <b>ksh</b>. The <b>-L</b> switch is mutually exclusive with the use of
    <b>-c</b> in <i>flags</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">If there is a single argument and the <b>-l</b> switch is given,
    the options that would be set or unset (the latter indicated with the prefix
    `<b>no</b>') are listed. <b>-l</b> can be combined with <b>-L</b> or
    <b>-R</b> and the list will be modified in the appropriate way. Note the
    list does not depend on the current setting of options, i.e. it includes all
    options that may in principle change, not just those that would actually
    change.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>flags</i> may be any of the invocation-time flags described
    in the section INVOCATION in <i>zsh</i>(1), except that `<b>-o EMACS</b>'
    and `<b>-o VI</b>' may not be used. Flags such as `<b>+r</b>'/`<b>+o
    RESTRICTED</b>' may be prohibited in some circumstances.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <b>-c</b> <i>arg</i> appears in <i>flags</i>, <i>arg</i> is
    evaluated while the requested emulation is temporarily in effect. In this
    case the emulation mode and all options are restored to their previous
    values before <b>emulate</b> returns. The <b>-R</b> switch may precede the
    name of the shell to emulate; note this has a meaning distinct from
    including <b>-R</b> in <i>flags</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Use of <b>-c</b> enables `sticky' emulation mode for functions
    defined within the evaluated expression: the emulation mode is associated
    thereafter with the function so that whenever the function is executed the
    emulation (respecting the <b>-R</b> switch, if present) and all options are
    set (and pattern disables cleared) before entry to the function, and the
    state is restored after exit. If the function is called when the sticky
    emulation is already in effect, either within an `<b>emulate</b>
    <i>shell</i> <b>-c</b>' expression or within another function with the same
    sticky emulation, entry and exit from the function do not cause options to
    be altered (except due to standard processing such as the
    <b>LOCAL_OPTIONS</b> option). This also applies to functions marked for
    autoload within the sticky emulation; the appropriate set of options will be
    applied at the point the function is loaded as well as when it is run.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b>emulate sh -c 'fni() { setopt cshnullglob; }</b>
<b>fno() { fni; }'</b>
<b>fno</b>
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The two functions <b>fni</b> and <b>fno</b> are defined with
    sticky <b>sh</b> emulation. <b>fno</b> is then executed, causing options
    associated with emulations to be set to their values in <b>sh</b>.
    <b>fno</b> then calls <b>fni</b>; because <b>fni</b> is also marked for
    sticky <b>sh</b> emulation, no option changes take place on entry to or exit
    from it. Hence the option <b>cshnullglob</b>, turned off by <b>sh</b>
    emulation, will be turned on within <b>fni</b> and remain on return to
    <b>fno</b>. On exit from <b>fno</b>, the emulation mode and all options will
    be restored to the state they were in before entry to the temporary
    emulation.</p>
<p class="Pp">The documentation above is typically sufficient for the intended
    purpose of executing code designed for other shells in a suitable
    environment. More detailed rules follow.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>1.</dt>
  <dd>The sticky emulation environment provided by `<b>emulate</b> <i>shell</i>
      <b>-c</b>' is identical to that provided by entry to a function marked for
      sticky emulation as a consequence of being defined in such an environment.
      Hence, for example, the sticky emulation is inherited by subfunctions
      defined within functions with sticky emulation.</dd>
  <dt>2.</dt>
  <dd>No change of options takes place on entry to or exit from functions that
      are not marked for sticky emulation, other than those that would normally
      take place, even if those functions are called within sticky
    emulation.</dd>
  <dt>3.</dt>
  <dd>No special handling is provided for functions marked for <b>autoload</b>
      nor for functions present in wordcode created by the <b>zcompile</b>
      command.</dd>
  <dt>4.</dt>
  <dd>The presence or absence of the <b>-R</b> switch to <b>emulate</b>
      corresponds to different sticky emulation modes, so for example
      `<b>emulate sh -c</b>', `<b>emulate -R sh -c</b>' and `<b>emulate csh
      -c</b>' are treated as three distinct sticky emulations.</dd>
  <dt>5.</dt>
  <dd>Difference in shell options supplied in addition to the basic emulation
      also mean the sticky emulations are different, so for example `<b>emulate
      zsh -c</b>' and `<b>emulate zsh -o cbases -c</b>' are treated as distinct
      sticky emulations.</dd>

      <b>-a</b> option causes <b>enable</b> to act on regular or global aliases.
      The <b>-s</b> option causes <b>enable</b> to act on suffix aliases. The
      <b>-f</b> option causes <b>enable</b> to act on shell functions. The
      <b>-r</b> option causes <b>enable</b> to act on reserved words. Without
      arguments all enabled hash table elements from the corresponding hash
      table are printed. With the <b>-m</b> flag the arguments are taken as
      patterns (should be quoted) and all hash table elements from the

<p class="Pp">`<b>fc -p</b>' pushes the current history list onto a stack and

    function to call `<b>fc -P</b>' manually. If no arguments are specified, the
    history list is left empty, <b>$HISTFILE</b> is unset, and <b>$HISTSIZE</b>
    &amp; <b>$SAVEHIST</b> are set to their default values. If one argument is
    given, <b>$HISTFILE</b> is set to that filename, <b>$HISTSIZE</b> &amp;
    <b>$SAVEHIST</b> are left unchanged, and the history file is read in (if it

    specified numeric value. Finally, if a third argument is specified,
    <b>$SAVEHIST</b> is set to a separate value from <b>$HISTSIZE</b>. You are
    free to change these environment values for the new history list however you
    desire in order to manipulate the new history list.</p>
<p class="Pp">`<b>fc -P</b>' pops the history list back to an older list saved
    by `<b>fc -p</b>'. The current list is saved to its <b>$HISTFILE</b> before

    appropriately, of course). The values of <b>$HISTFILE</b>, <b>$HISTSIZE</b>,
    and <b>$SAVEHIST</b> are restored to the values they had when `<b>fc -p</b>'
    was called. Note that this restoration can conflict with making these
    variables &quot;local&quot;, so your best bet is to avoid local declarations
    for these variables in functions that use `<b>fc -p</b>'. The one other
    guaranteed-safe combination is declaring these variables to be local at the
    top of your function and using the automatic option (<b>-a</b>) with `<b>fc

    automatic popping if you need to do so before the function exits.</p>
<p class="Pp">`<b>fc -R</b>' reads the history from the given file, `<b>fc

    only those events that are not already contained within the internal history
    list are added. If the <b>-I</b> option is added to <b>-A</b> or <b>-W</b>,

<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">The <b>-x</b> option indicates that any functions output will have

    also be 0 to suppress all indentation.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>-W</b> option turns on the option <b>WARN_NESTED_VAR</b>
    for the named function or functions only. The option is turned off at the
    start of nested functions (apart from anonoymous functions) unless the
    called function also has the <b>-W</b> attribute.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>-c</b> option causes <i>oldfn</i> to be copied to
    <i>newfn</i>. The copy is efficiently handled internally by reference
    counting. If <i>oldfn</i> was marked for autoload it is first loaded and if
    this fails the copy fails. Either function may subsequently be redefined
    without affecting the other. A typical idiom is that <i>oldfn</i> is the
    name of a library shell function which is then redefined to call
    <b>newfn</b>, thereby installing a modified version of the function.</p>
<p class="Pp">Use of the <b>-M</b> option may not be combined with any of the
    options handled by <b>typeset -f</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>functions -M</b> <i>mathfn</i> defines <i>mathfn</i> as the

    expressions; see the section `Arithmetic Evaluation' in <i>zshmisc</i>(1).
    By default <i>mathfn</i> may take any number of comma-separated arguments.
    If <i>min</i> is given, it must have exactly <i>min</i> args; if <i>min</i>
    and <i>max</i> are both given, it must have at least <i>min</i> and at most
    <i>max</i> args. <i>max</i> may be -1 to indicate that there is no upper
    limit.</p>
<p class="Pp">By default the function is implemented by a shell function of the
    same name; if <i>shellfn</i> is specified it gives the name of the
    corresponding shell function while <i>mathfn</i> remains the name used in
    arithmetical expressions. The name of the function in <b>$0</b> is
    <i>mathfn</i> (not <i>shellfn</i> as would usually be the case), provided
    the option <b>FUNCTION_ARGZERO</b> is in effect. The positional parameters
    in the shell function correspond to the arguments of the mathematical
    function call. The result of the last arithmetical expression evaluated
    inside the shell function (even if it is a form that normally only returns a
    status) gives the result of the mathematical function.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the additional option <b>-s</b> is given to <b>functions
    -M</b>, the argument to the function is a single string: anything between
    the opening and matching closing parenthesis is passed to the function as a
    single argument, even if it includes commas or white space. The minimum and
    maximum argument specifiers must therefore be 1 if given. An empty argument

      or by creating appropriate shell parameters (for the named directory hash
      table). The choice of hash table to work on is determined by the <b>-d</b>

<p class="Pp">For each <i>name</i> with a corresponding <i>value</i>, put

<p class="Pp">If arguments remain unused after formatting, the format string is

<p class="Pp">The command attempts to implement POSIX and its extensions where

  <dt><b>trap</b> [ <i>arg</i> ] [ <i>sig</i> ... ]</dt>
  <dd><i>arg</i> is a series of commands (usually quoted to protect it from
      immediate evaluation by the shell) to be read and executed when the shell
      receives any of the signals specified by one or more <i>sig</i> args. Each
      <i>sig</i> can be given as a number, or as the name of a signal either
      with or without the string <b>SIG</b> in front (e.g. 1, HUP, and SIGHUP
      are all the same signal).</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">If <i>arg</i> is `<b>-</b>', then the specified signals are reset
    to their defaults, or, if no <i>sig</i> args are present, all traps are
    reset.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <i>arg</i> is an empty string, then the specified signals are
    ignored by the shell (and by the commands it invokes).</p>
<p class="Pp">If <i>arg</i> is omitted but one or more <i>sig</i> args are
    provided (i.e. the first argument is a valid signal number or name), the
    effect is the same as if <i>arg</i> had been specified as `<b>-</b>'.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>trap</b> command with no arguments prints a list of
    commands associated with each signal.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <i>sig</i> is <b>ZERR</b> then <i>arg</i> will be executed
    after each command with a nonzero exit status. <b>ERR</b> is an alias for
    <b>ZERR</b> on systems that have no <b>SIGERR</b> signal (this is the usual
    case).</p>
<p class="Pp">If <i>sig</i> is <b>DEBUG</b> then <i>arg</i> will be executed
    before each command if the option <b>DEBUG_BEFORE_CMD</b> is set (as it is
    by default), else after each command. Here, a `command' is what is described
    as a `sublist' in the shell grammar, see the section SIMPLE COMMANDS &amp;
    PIPELINES in <i>zshmisc</i>(1). If <b>DEBUG_BEFORE_CMD</b> is set various
    additional features are available. First, it is possible to skip the next
    command by setting the option <b>ERR_EXIT</b>; see the description of the
    <b>ERR_EXIT</b> option in <i>zshoptions</i>(1). Also, the shell parameter
    <b>ZSH_DEBUG_CMD</b> is set to the string corresponding to the command to be
    executed following the trap. Note that this string is reconstructed from the
    internal format and may not be formatted the same way as the original text.
    The parameter is unset after the trap is executed.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <i>sig</i> is <b>0</b> or <b>EXIT</b> and the <b>trap</b>
    statement is executed inside the body of a function, then the command
    <i>arg</i> is executed after the function completes. The value of <b>$?</b>
    at the start of execution is the exit status of the shell or the return
    status of the function exiting. If <i>sig</i> is <b>0</b> or <b>EXIT</b> and
    the <b>trap</b> statement is not executed inside the body of a function,
    then the command <i>arg</i> is executed when the shell terminates; the trap
    runs before any <b>zshexit</b> hook functions.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>ZERR</b>, <b>DEBUG</b>, and <b>EXIT</b> traps are not executed
    inside other traps. <b>ZERR</b> and <b>DEBUG</b> traps are kept within
    subshells, while other traps are reset.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that traps defined with the <b>trap</b> builtin are slightly
    different from those defined as `<b>TRAP</b><i>NAL</i> () { ... }', as the
    latter have their own function environment (line numbers, local variables,
    etc.) while the former use the environment of the command in which they were
    called. For example,</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">

      tty settings by external programs will be honored by the shell, except for
      changes in the size of the screen; the shell will simply reset the
      settings to their previous values as soon as each command exits or is
      suspended. Thus, <b>stty</b> and similar programs have no effect when the

</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">Except as noted below for control flags that change the behavior,
    a parameter is created for each <i>name</i> that does not already refer to
    one. When inside a function, a new parameter is created for every
    <i>name</i> (even those that already exist), and is unset again when the
    function completes. See `Local Parameters' in <i>zshparam</i>(1). The same
    rules apply to special shell parameters, which retain their special
    attributes when made local.</p>
<p class="Pp">For each <i>name</i><b>=</b><i>value</i> assignment, the parameter
    <i>name</i> is set to <i>value</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the shell option <b>TYPESET_SILENT</b> is not set, for each
    remaining <i>name</i> that refers to a parameter that is already set, the
    name and value of the parameter are printed in the form of an assignment.
    Nothing is printed for newly-created parameters, or when any attribute flags
    listed below are given along with the <i>name</i>. Using `<b>+</b>' instead
    of minus to introduce an attribute turns it off.</p>
<p class="Pp">If no <i>name</i> is present, the names and values of all
    parameters are printed. In this case the attribute flags restrict the
    display to only those parameters that have the specified attributes, and
    using `<b>+</b>' rather than `<b>-</b>' to introduce the flag suppresses
    printing of the values of parameters when there is no parameter name.</p>
<p class="Pp">All forms of the command handle scalar assignment. Array
    assignment is possible if any of the reserved words <b>declare</b>,
    <b>export</b>, <b>float</b>, <b>integer</b>, <b>local</b>, <b>readonly</b>
    or <b>typeset</b> is matched when the line is parsed (N.B. not when it is
    executed). In this case the arguments are parsed as assignments, except that
    the `<b>+=</b>' syntax and the <b>GLOB_ASSIGN</b> option are not supported,
    and scalar values after <b>=</b> are <i>not</i> split further into words,
    even if expanded (regardless of the setting of the <b>KSH_TYPESET</b>
    option; this option is obsolete).</p>
<p class="Pp">Examples of the differences between command and reserved word
    parsing:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b># Reserved word parsing</b>
<b>typeset svar=$(echo one word) avar=(several words)</b>
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The above creates a scalar parameter <b>svar</b> and an array
    parameter <b>avar</b> as if the assignments had been</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b>svar=&quot;one word&quot;</b>
<b>avar=(several words)</b>
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">On the other hand:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b># Normal builtin interface</b>
<b>builtin typeset svar=$(echo two words)</b>
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The <b>builtin</b> keyword causes the above to use the standard
    builtin interface to <b>typeset</b> in which argument parsing is performed
    in the same way as for other commands. This example creates a scalar
    <b>svar</b> containing the value <b>two</b> and another scalar parameter
    <b>words</b> with no value. An array value in this case would either cause
    an error or be treated as an obscure set of glob qualifiers.</p>
<p class="Pp">Arbitrary arguments are allowed if they take the form of
    assignments after command line expansion; however, these only perform scalar
    assignment:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b>var='svar=val'</b>
<b>typeset $var</b>
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The above sets the scalar parameter <b>svar</b> to the value
    <b>val</b>. Parentheses around the value within <b>var</b> would not cause
    array assignment as they will be treated as ordinary characters when
    <b>$var</b> is substituted. Any non-trivial expansion in the name part of
    the assignment causes the argument to be treated in this fashion:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b>typeset {var1,var2,var3}=name</b>
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The above syntax is valid, and has the expected effect of setting
    the three parameters to the same value, but the command line is parsed as a
    set of three normal command line arguments to <b>typeset</b> after
    expansion. Hence it is not possible to assign to multiple arrays by this
    means.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that each interface to any of the commands my be disabled
    separately. For example, `<b>disable -r typeset</b>' disables the reserved
    word interface to <b>typeset</b>, exposing the builtin interface, while
    `<b>disable typeset</b>' disables the builtin. Note that disabling the
    reserved word interface for <b>typeset</b> may cause problems with the
    output of `<b>typeset -p</b>', which assumes the reserved word interface is
    available in order to restore array and associative array values.</p>
<p class="Pp">Unlike parameter assignment statements, <b>typeset</b>'s exit
    status on an assignment that involves a command substitution does not
    reflect the exit status of the command substitution. Therefore, to test for
    an error in a command substitution, separate the declaration of the
    parameter from its initialization:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b># WRONG</b>
<b>typeset var1=$(exit 1) || echo &quot;Trouble with var1&quot;</b>
<b># RIGHT</b>
<b>typeset var1 &amp;&amp; var1=$(exit 1) || echo &quot;Trouble with var1&quot;</b>
<b></b>
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">To initialize a parameter <i>param</i> to a command output and
    mark it readonly, use <b>typeset -r </b><i>param</i> or <b>readonly
    </b><i>param</i> after the parameter assignment statement.</p>
<p class="Pp">If no attribute flags are given, and either no <i>name</i>
    arguments are present or the flag <b>+m</b> is used, then each parameter
    name printed is preceded by a list of the attributes of that parameter
    (<b>array</b>, <b>association</b>, <b>exported</b>, <b>float</b>,
    <b>integer</b>, <b>readonly</b>, or <b>undefined</b> for autoloaded
    parameters not yet loaded). If <b>+m</b> is used with attribute flags, and
    all those flags are introduced with <b>+</b>, the matching parameter names
    are printed but their values are not.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following control flags change the behavior of
  <b>typeset</b>:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>+</b></dt>
  <dd>If `<b>+</b>' appears by itself in a separate word as the last option,
      then the names of all parameters (functions with <b>-f</b>) are printed,
      but the values (function bodies) are not. No <i>name</i> arguments may
      appear, and it is an error for any other options to follow `<b>+</b>'. The
      effect of `<b>+</b>' is as if all attribute flags which precede it were
      given with a `<b>+</b>' prefix. For example, `<b>typeset -U +</b>' is
      equivalent to `<b>typeset +U</b>' and displays the names of all arrays
      having the uniqueness attribute, whereas `<b>typeset -f -U +</b>' displays
      the names of all autoloadable functions. If <b>+</b> is the only option,
      then type information (array, readonly, etc.) is also printed for each
      parameter, in the same manner as `<b>typeset +m &quot;*&quot;</b>'.</dd>
  <dt><b>-g</b></dt>
  <dd>The <b>-g</b> (global) means that any resulting parameter will not be
      restricted to local scope. Note that this does not necessarily mean that
      the parameter will be global, as the flag will apply to any existing
      parameter (even if unset) from an enclosing function. This flag does not
      affect the parameter after creation, hence it has no effect when listing
      existing parameters, nor does the flag <b>+g</b> have any effect except in
      combination with <b>-m</b> (see below).</dd>
  <dt><b>-m</b></dt>
  <dd>If the <b>-m</b> flag is given the <i>name</i> arguments are taken as
      patterns (use quoting to prevent these from being interpreted as file
      patterns). With no attribute flags, all parameters (or functions with the
      <b>-f</b> flag) with matching names are printed (the shell option
      <b>TYPESET_SILENT</b> is not used in this case).</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">If the <b>+g</b> flag is combined with <b>-m</b>, a new local
    parameter is created for every matching parameter that is not already local.
    Otherwise <b>-m</b> applies all other flags or assignments to the existing
    parameters.</p>
<p class="Pp">Except when assignments are made with
    <i>name</i><b>=</b><i>value</i>, using <b>+m</b> forces the matching
    parameters and their attributes to be printed, even inside a function. Note
    that <b>-m</b> is ignored if no patterns are given, so `<b>typeset -m</b>'
    displays attributes but `<b>typeset -a +m</b>' does not.</p>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>-p</b> [ <i>n</i> ]</dt>
  <dd>If the <b>-p</b> option is given, parameters and values are printed in the
      form of a typeset command with an assignment, regardless of other flags
      and options. Note that the <b>-H</b> flag on parameters is respected; no
      value will be shown for these parameters.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp"><b>-p</b> may be followed by an optional integer argument.
    Currently only the value <b>1</b> is supported. In this case arrays and
    associative arrays are printed with newlines between indented elements for
    readability.</p>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>-T</b> [ <i>scalar</i>[<b>=</b><i>value</i>]
    <i>array</i>[<b>=(</b><i>value</i> ...<b>)</b>] [ <i>sep</i> ] ]</dt>
  <dd>This flag has a different meaning when used with <b>-f</b>; see below.
      Otherwise the <b>-T</b> option requires zero, two, or three arguments to
      be present. With no arguments, the list of parameters created in this
      fashion is shown. With two or three arguments, the first two are the name
      of a scalar and of an array parameter (in that order) that will be tied
      together in the manner of <b>$PATH</b> and <b>$path</b>. The optional
      third argument is a single-character separator which will be used to join
      the elements of the array to form the scalar; if absent, a colon is used,
      as with <b>$PATH</b>. Only the first character of the separator is
      significant; any remaining characters are ignored. Multibyte characters
      are not yet supported.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">Only one of the scalar and array parameters may be assigned an
    initial value (the restrictions on assignment forms described above also
    apply).</p>
<p class="Pp">Both the scalar and the array may be manipulated as normal. If one
    is unset, the other will automatically be unset too. There is no way of
    untying the variables without unsetting them, nor of converting the type of
    one of them with another <b>typeset</b> command; <b>+T</b> does not work,
    assigning an array to <i>scalar</i> is an error, and assigning a scalar to
    <i>array</i> sets it to be a single-element array.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that both `<b>typeset -xT ...</b>' and `<b>export -T ...</b>'
    work, but only the scalar will be marked for export. Setting the value using
    the scalar version causes a split on all separators (which cannot be
    quoted). It is possible to apply <b>-T</b> to two previously tied variables
    but with a different separator character, in which case the variables remain
    joined as before but the separator is changed.</p>
<p class="Pp">When an existing scalar is tied to a new array, the value of the
    scalar is preserved but no attribute other than export will be
  preserved.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Attribute flags that transform the final value (<b>-L</b>,
    <b>-R</b>, <b>-Z</b>, <b>-l</b>, <b>-u</b>) are only applied to the expanded
    value at the point of a parameter expansion expression using `<b>$</b>'.
    They are not applied when a parameter is retrieved internally by the shell
    for any purpose.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following attribute flags may be specified:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>-A</b></dt>
  <dd>The names refer to associative array parameters; see `Array Parameters' in
      <i>zshparam</i>(1).</dd>
  <dt><b>-L</b> [ <i>n</i> ]</dt>
  <dd>Left justify and remove leading blanks from the value when the parameter
      is expanded. If <i>n</i> is nonzero, it defines the width of the field. If
      <i>n</i> is zero, the width is determined by the width of the value of the
      first assignment. In the case of numeric parameters, the length of the
      complete value assigned to the parameter is used to determine the width,
      not the value that would be output.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">The width is the count of characters, which may be multibyte
    characters if the <b>MULTIBYTE</b> option is in effect. Note that the screen
    width of the character is not taken into account; if this is required, use
    padding with parameter expansion flags
    <b>${(ml</b><i>...</i><b>)</b><i>...</i><b>}</b> as described in `Parameter
    Expansion Flags' in <i>zshexpn</i>(1).</p>
<p class="Pp">When the parameter is expanded, it is filled on the right with
    blanks or truncated if necessary to fit the field. Note truncation can lead
    to unexpected results with numeric parameters. Leading zeros are removed if
    the <b>-Z</b> flag is also set.</p>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>-R</b> [ <i>n</i> ]</dt>
  <dd>Similar to <b>-L</b>, except that right justification is used; when the
      parameter is expanded, the field is left filled with blanks or truncated
      from the end. May not be combined with the <b>-Z</b> flag.</dd>
  <dt><b>-U</b></dt>
  <dd>For arrays (but not for associative arrays), keep only the first
      occurrence of each duplicated value. This may also be set for tied
      parameters (see <b>-T</b>) or colon-separated special parameters like
      <b>PATH</b> or <b>FIGNORE</b>, etc. Note the flag takes effect on
      assignment, and the type of the variable being assigned to is
      determinative; for variables with shared values it is therefore
      recommended to set the flag for all interfaces, e.g. `<b>typeset -U PATH
      path</b>'.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">This flag has a different meaning when used with <b>-f</b>; see
    below.</p>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>-Z</b> [ <i>n</i> ]</dt>
  <dd>Specially handled if set along with the <b>-L</b> flag. Otherwise, similar
      to <b>-R</b>, except that leading zeros are used for padding instead of
      blanks if the first non-blank character is a digit. Numeric parameters are
      specially handled: they are always eligible for padding with zeroes, and
      the zeroes are inserted at an appropriate place in the output.</dd>
  <dt><b>-a</b></dt>
  <dd>The names refer to array parameters. An array parameter may be created
      this way, but it may be assigned to in the <b>typeset</b> statement only
      if the reserved word form of <b>typeset</b> is enabled (as it is by
      default). When displaying, both normal and associative arrays are
    shown.</dd>
  <dt><b>-f</b></dt>
  <dd>The names refer to functions rather than parameters. No assignments can be
      made, and the only other valid flags are <b>-t</b>, <b>-T</b>, <b>-k</b>,
      <b>-u</b>, <b>-U</b> and <b>-z</b>. The flag <b>-t</b> turns on execution
      tracing for this function; the flag <b>-T</b> does the same, but turns off
      tracing for any named (not anonymous) function called from the present
      one, unless that function also has the <b>-t</b> or <b>-T</b> flag. The
      <b>-u</b> and <b>-U</b> flags cause the function to be marked for
      autoloading; <b>-U</b> also causes alias expansion to be suppressed when
      the function is loaded. See the description of the `<b>autoload</b>'
      builtin for details.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">Note that the builtin <b>functions</b> provides the same basic
    capabilities as <b>typeset -f</b> but gives access to a few extra options;
    <b>autoload</b> gives further additional options for the case <b>typeset
    -fu</b> and <b>typeset -fU</b>.</p>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>-h</b></dt>
  <dd>Hide: only useful for special parameters (those marked `&lt;S&gt;' in the
      table in <i>zshparam</i>(1)), and for local parameters with the same name
      as a special parameter, though harmless for others. A special parameter
      with this attribute will not retain its special effect when made local.
      Thus after `<b>typeset -h</b> <b>PATH</b>', a function containing
      `<b>typeset PATH</b>' will create an ordinary local parameter without the
      usual behaviour of <b>PATH</b>. Alternatively, the local parameter may
      itself be given this attribute; hence inside a function `<b>typeset -h
      PATH</b>' creates an ordinary local parameter and the special <b>PATH</b>
      parameter is not altered in any way. It is also possible to create a local
      parameter using `<b>typeset +h </b><i>special</i>', where the local copy
      of <i>special</i> will retain its special properties regardless of having
      the <b>-h</b> attribute. Global special parameters loaded from shell
      modules (currently those in <b>zsh/mapfile</b> and <b>zsh/parameter</b>)
      are automatically given the <b>-h</b> attribute to avoid name
    clashes.</dd>
  <dt><b>-H</b></dt>
  <dd>Hide value: specifies that <b>typeset</b> will not display the value of
      the parameter when listing parameters; the display for such parameters is
      always as if the `<b>+</b>' flag had been given. Use of the parameter is
      in other respects normal, and the option does not apply if the parameter
      is specified by name, or by pattern with the <b>-m</b> option. This is on
      by default for the parameters in the <b>zsh/parameter</b> and
      <b>zsh/mapfile</b> modules. Note, however, that unlike the <b>-h</b> flag
      this is also useful for non-special parameters.</dd>
  <dt><b>-i</b> [ <i>n</i> ]</dt>
  <dd>Use an internal integer representation. If <i>n</i> is nonzero it defines
      the output arithmetic base, otherwise it is determined by the first
      assignment. Bases from 2 to 36 inclusive are allowed.</dd>
  <dt><b>-E</b> [ <i>n</i> ]</dt>
  <dd>Use an internal double-precision floating point representation. On output
      the variable will be converted to scientific notation. If <i>n</i> is
      nonzero it defines the number of significant figures to display; the
      default is ten.</dd>
  <dt><b>-F</b> [ <i>n</i> ]</dt>
  <dd>Use an internal double-precision floating point representation. On output
      the variable will be converted to fixed-point decimal notation. If
      <i>n</i> is nonzero it defines the number of digits to display after the
      decimal point; the default is ten.</dd>
  <dt><b>-l</b></dt>
  <dd>Convert the result to lower case whenever the parameter is expanded. The
      value is <i>not</i> converted when assigned.</dd>
  <dt><b>-r</b></dt>
  <dd>The given <i>name</i>s are marked readonly. Note that if <i>name</i> is a

<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">If the <b>POSIX_BUILTINS</b> option is set, the readonly attribute

<p class="Pp">It is still possible to change other attributes of the variable
    though, some of which like <b>-U</b> or <b>-Z</b> would affect the value.
    More generally, the readonly attribute should not be relied on as a security
    mechanism.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that in zsh (like in pdksh but unlike most other shells) it
    is still possible to create a local variable of the same name as this is
    considered a different variable (though this variable, too, can be marked

      mask to be printed as a symbolic value. Otherwise, the mask is printed as
      an octal number. Note that in the symbolic form the permissions you
      specify are those which are to be allowed (not denied) to the users
      specified.</dd>
  <dt><b>unalias</b> [ <b>-ams</b> ] <i>name</i> ...</dt>
  <dd>Removes aliases. This command works the same as <b>unhash -a</b>, except
      that the <b>-a</b> option removes all regular or global aliases, or with
      <b>-s</b> all suffix aliases: in this case no <i>name</i> arguments may
      appear. The options <b>-m</b> (remove by pattern) and <b>-s</b> without
      <b>-a</b> (remove listed suffix aliases) behave as for <b>unhash -a</b>.
      Note that the meaning of <b>-a</b> is different between <b>unalias</b> and

  <dt><b>unfunction</b></dt>
  <dd>Same as <b>unhash -f</b>.</dd>
  <dt><b>unhash</b> [ <b>-adfms</b> ] <i>name</i> ...</dt>
  <dd>Remove the element named <i>name</i> from an internal hash table. The
      default is remove elements from the command hash table. The <b>-a</b>
      option causes <b>unhash</b> to remove regular or global aliases; note when
      removing a global aliases that the argument must be quoted to prevent it
      from being expanded before being passed to the command. The <b>-s</b>
      option causes <b>unhash</b> to remove suffix aliases. The <b>-f</b> option
      causes <b>unhash</b> to remove shell functions. The <b>-d</b> options
      causes <b>unhash</b> to remove named directories. If the <b>-m</b> flag is
      given the arguments are taken as patterns (should be quoted) and all
      elements of the corresponding hash table with matching names will be
      removed.</dd>
  <dt><b>unlimit</b> [ <b>-hs</b> ] <i>resource</i> ...</dt>
  <dd>The resource limit for each <i>resource</i> is set to the hard limit. If
      the <b>-h</b> flag is given and the shell has appropriate privileges, the
      hard resource limit for each <i>resource</i> is removed. The resources of
      the shell process are only changed if the <b>-s</b> flag is given.</dd>

  <dt><b>wait</b> [ <i>job</i> ... ]</dt>
  <dd>Wait for the specified jobs or processes. If <i>job</i> is not given then
      all currently active child processes are waited for. Each <i>job</i> can
      be either a job specification or the process ID of a job in the job table.
      The exit status from this command is that of the job waited for. If
      <i>job</i> represents an unknown job or process ID, a warning is printed
      (unless the <b>POSIX_BUILTINS</b> option is set) and the exit status is
      127.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">It is possible to wait for recent processes (specified by process
    ID, not by job) that were running in the background even if the process has
    exited. Typically the process ID will be recorded by capturing the value of
    the variable <b>$!</b> immediately after the process has been started. There
    is a limit on the number of process IDs remembered by the shell; this is
    given by the value of the system configuration parameter <b>CHILD_MAX</b>.
    When this limit is reached, older process IDs are discarded, least recently
    started processes first.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note there is no protection against the process ID wrapping, i.e.
    if the wait is not executed soon enough there is a chance the process waited
    for is the wrong one. A conflict implies both process IDs have been
    generated by the shell, as other processes are not recorded, and that the
    user is potentially interested in both, so this problem is intrinsic to
    process IDs.</p>

  <dd>This builtin command can be used to compile functions or scripts, storing
      the compiled form in a file, and to examine files containing the compiled
      form. This allows faster autoloading of functions and sourcing of scripts
      by avoiding parsing of the text when the files are read.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">The first form (without the <b>-c</b>, <b>-a</b> or <b>-t</b>
    options) creates a compiled file. If only the <i>file</i> argument is given,
    the output file has the name `<i>file</i><b>.zwc</b>' and will be placed in
    the same directory as the <i>file</i>. The shell will load the compiled file
    instead of the normal function file when the function is autoloaded; see the
    section `Autoloading Functions' in <i>zshmisc</i>(1) for a description of
    how autoloaded functions are searched. The extension <b>.zwc</b> stands for
    `zsh word code'.</p>
<p class="Pp">If there is at least one <i>name</i> argument, all the named files
    are compiled into the output <i>file</i> given as the first argument. If
    <i>file</i> does not end in <b>.zwc</b>, this extension is automatically
    appended. Files containing multiple compiled functions are called `digest'
    files, and are intended to be used as elements of the
    <b>FPATH</b>/<b>fpath</b> special array.</p>
<p class="Pp">The second form, with the <b>-c</b> or <b>-a</b> options, writes
    the compiled definitions for all the named functions into <i>file</i>. For
    <b>-c</b>, the names must be functions currently defined in the shell, not
    those marked for autoloading. Undefined functions that are marked for
    autoloading may be written by using the <b>-a</b> option, in which case the
    <b>fpath</b> is searched and the contents of the definition files for those
    functions, if found, are compiled into <i>file</i>. If both <b>-c</b> and
    <b>-a</b> are given, names of both defined functions and functions marked
    for autoloading may be given. In either case, the functions in files written
    with the <b>-c</b> or <b>-a</b> option will be autoloaded as if the
    <b>KSH_AUTOLOAD</b> option were unset.</p>
<p class="Pp">The reason for handling loaded and not-yet-loaded functions with
    different options is that some definition files for autoloading define
    multiple functions, including the function with the same name as the file,
    and, at the end, call that function. In such cases the output of
    `<b>zcompile -c</b>' does not include the additional functions defined in
    the file, and any other initialization code in the file is lost. Using
    `<b>zcompile -a</b>' captures all this extra information.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the <b>-m</b> option is combined with <b>-c</b> or <b>-a</b>,
    the <i>name</i>s are used as patterns and all functions whose names match
    one of these patterns will be written. If no <i>name</i> is given, the
    definitions of all functions currently defined or marked as autoloaded will
    be written.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note the second form cannot be used for compiling functions that
    include redirections as part of the definition rather than within the body
    of the function; for example</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b>fn1() { { ... } &gt;~/logfile }</b>
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">can be compiled but</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b>fn1() { ... } &gt;~/logfile</b>
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">cannot. It is possible to use the first form of <b>zcompile</b> to
    compile autoloadable functions that include the full function definition
    instead of just the body of the function.</p>
<p class="Pp">The third form, with the <b>-t</b> option, examines an existing
    compiled file. Without further arguments, the names of the original files
    compiled into it are listed. The first line of output shows the version of
    the shell which compiled the file and how the file will be used (i.e. by
    reading it directly or by mapping it into memory). With arguments, nothing
    is output and the return status is set to zero if definitions for <i>all</i>
    <i>name</i>s were found in the compiled file, and non-zero if the definition
    for at least one <i>name</i> was not found.</p>
<p class="Pp">Other options:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>-U</b></dt>
  <dd>Aliases are not expanded when compiling the <i>name</i>d files.</dd>
  <dt><b>-R</b></dt>
  <dd>When the compiled file is read, its contents are copied into the shell's
      memory, rather than memory-mapped (see <b>-M</b>). This happens
      automatically on systems that do not support memory mapping.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">When compiling scripts instead of autoloadable functions, it is
    often desirable to use this option; otherwise the whole file, including the
    code to define functions which have already been defined, will remain
    mapped, consequently wasting memory.</p>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>-M</b></dt>
  <dd>The compiled file is mapped into the shell's memory when read. This is
      done in such a way that multiple instances of the shell running on the
      same host will share this mapped file. If neither <b>-R</b> nor <b>-M</b>
      is given, the <b>zcompile</b> builtin decides what to do based on the size
      of the compiled file.</dd>
  <dt><b>-k</b></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>-z</b></dt>
  <dd>These options are used when the compiled file contains functions which are
      to be autoloaded. If <b>-z</b> is given, the function will be autoloaded
      as if the <b>KSH_AUTOLOAD</b> option is <i>not</i> set, even if it is set
      at the time the compiled file is read, while if the <b>-k</b> is given,
      the function will be loaded as if <b>KSH_AUTOLOAD</b> <i>is</i> set. These
      options also take precedence over any <b>-k</b> or <b>-z</b> options
      specified to the <b>autoload</b> builtin. If neither of these options is
      given, the function will be loaded as determined by the setting of the
      <b>KSH_AUTOLOAD</b> option at the time the compiled file is read.
    <p class="Pp">These options may also appear as many times as necessary
        between the listed <i>name</i>s to specify the loading style of all
        following functions, up to the next <b>-k</b> or <b>-z</b>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The created file always contains two versions of the compiled
        format, one for big-endian machines and one for small-endian machines.
        The upshot of this is that the compiled file is machine independent and
        if it is read or mapped, only one half of the file is actually used (and
        mapped).</p>

<p class="Pp">Without arguments the names of all currently loaded binary modules

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>zmodload</b> [ <b>-is</b> ] <i>name</i> ...</dt>

  <dt><b>zmodload</b> <b>-u</b> [ <b>-i</b> ] <i>name</i> ...</dt>
  <dd>In the simplest case, <b>zmodload</b> loads a binary module. The module
      must be in a file with a name consisting of the specified <i>name</i>
      followed by a standard suffix, usually `<b>.so</b>' (`<b>.sl</b>' on
      HPUX). If the module to be loaded is already loaded the duplicate module
      is ignored. If <b>zmodload</b> detects an inconsistency, such as an
      invalid module name or circular dependency list, the current code block is
      aborted. If it is available, the module is loaded if necessary, while if
      it is not available, non-zero status is silently returned. The option
      <b>-i</b> is accepted for compatibility but has no effect.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">The <i>name</i>d module is searched for in the same way a command
    is, using <b>$module_path</b> instead of <b>$path</b>. However, the path
    search is performed even when the module name contains a `<b>/</b>', which
    it usually does. There is no way to prevent the path search.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the module supports features (see below), <b>zmodload</b> tries
    to enable all features when loading a module. If the module was successfully
    loaded but not all features could be enabled, <b>zmodload</b> returns status
    2.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the option <b>-s</b> is given, no error is printed if the
    module was not available (though other errors indicating a problem with the
    module are printed). The return status indicates if the module was loaded.
    This is appropriate if the caller considers the module optional.</p>
<p class="Pp">With <b>-u</b>, <b>zmodload</b> unloads modules. The same
    <i>name</i> must be given that was given when the module was loaded, but it
    is not necessary for the module to exist in the file system. The <b>-i</b>
    option suppresses the error if the module is already unloaded (or was never
    loaded).</p>
<p class="Pp">Each module has a boot and a cleanup function. The module will not

      of <i>feature</i>s is set to the required state. If no <i>feature</i>s are

      to turn the feature on, or <b>-</b> to turn it off; the <b>+</b> is
      assumed if neither character is present. Any feature not explicitly
      mentioned is left in its current state; if the module was not previously
      loaded this means any such features will remain disabled. The return
      status is zero if all features were set, 1 if the module failed to load,
      and 2 if some features could not be set (for example, a parameter couldn't
      be added because there was a different parameter of the same name) but the

<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">The standard features are builtins, conditions, parameters and
    math functions; these are indicated by the prefix `<b>b:</b>', `<b>c:</b>'
    (`<b>C:</b>' for an infix condition), `<b>p:</b>' and `<b>f:</b>',
    respectively, followed by the name that the corresponding feature would have
    in the shell. For example, `<b>b:strftime</b>' indicates a builtin named
    <b>strftime</b> and <b>p:EPOCHSECONDS</b> indicates a parameter named
    <b>EPOCHSECONDS</b>. The module may provide other (`abstract') features of
    its own as indicated by its documentation; these have no prefix.</p>
<p class="Pp">With <b>-l</b> or <b>-L</b>, features provided by the module are
    listed. With <b>-l</b> alone, a list of features together with their states
    is shown, one feature per line. With <b>-L</b> alone, a <b>zmodload -F</b>
    command that would cause enabled features of the module to be turned on is
    shown. With <b>-lL</b>, a <b>zmodload -F</b> command that would cause all
    the features to be set to their current state is shown. If one of these
    combinations is given with the option <b>-P</b> <i>param</i> then the
    parameter <i>param</i> is set to an array of features, either features
    together with their state or (if <b>-L</b> alone is given) enabled
  features.</p>
<p class="Pp">With the option <b>-L</b> the module name may be omitted; then a
    list of all enabled features for all modules providing features is printed
    in the form of <b>zmodload -F</b> commands. If <b>-l</b> is also given, the
    state of both enabled and disabled features is output in that form.</p>
<p class="Pp">A set of features may be provided together with <b>-l</b> or
    <b>-L</b> and a module name; in that case only the state of those features
    is considered. Each feature may be preceded by <b>+</b> or <b>-</b> but the
    character has no effect. If no set of features is provided, all features are
    considered.</p>
<p class="Pp">With <b>-e</b>, the command first tests that the module is loaded;
    if it is not, status 1 is returned. If the module is loaded, the list of
    features given as an argument is examined. Any feature given with no prefix
    is simply tested to see if the module provides it; any feature given with a
    prefix <b>+</b> or <b>-</b> is tested to see if is provided and in the given
    state. If the tests on all features in the list succeed, status 0 is
    returned, else status 1.</p>
<p class="Pp">With <b>-m</b>, each entry in the given list of features is taken
    as a pattern to be matched against the list of features provided by the
    module. An initial <b>+</b> or <b>-</b> must be given explicitly. This may
    not be combined with the <b>-a</b> option as autoloads must be specified
    explicitly.</p>
<p class="Pp">With <b>-a</b>, the given list of features is marked for autoload
    from the specified module, which may not yet be loaded. An optional <b>+</b>
    may appear before the feature name. If the feature is prefixed with
    <b>-</b>, any existing autoload is removed. The options <b>-l</b> and
    <b>-L</b> may be used to list autoloads. Autoloading is specific to
    individual features; when the module is loaded only the requested feature is
    enabled. Autoload requests are preserved if the module is subsequently
    unloaded until an explicit `<b>zmodload -Fa</b> <i>module</i>
    <b>-</b><i>feature</i>' is issued. It is not an error to request an autoload
    for a feature of a module that is already loaded.</p>
<p class="Pp">When the module is loaded each autoload is checked against the
    features actually provided by the module; if the feature is not provided the
    autoload request is deleted. A warning message is output; if the module is
    being loaded to provide a different feature, and that autoload is
    successful, there is no effect on the status of the current command. If the

      to <b>zmodload</b> or implicitly, the shell will attempt to load
      <i>module</i> instead. If <i>module</i> is not given, show the definition
      of <i>modalias</i>. If no arguments are given, list all defined module
      aliases. When listing, if the <b>-L</b> flag was also given, list the
      definition as a <b>zmodload</b> command to recreate the alias.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">The existence of aliases for modules is completely independent of
    whether the name resolved is actually loaded as a module: while the alias
    exists, loading and unloading the module under any alias has exactly the
    same effect as using the resolved name, and does not affect the connection
    between the alias and the resolved name which can be removed either by
    <b>zmodload -R</b> or by redefining the alias. Chains of aliases (i.e. where
    the first resolved name is itself an alias) are valid so long as these are
    not circular. As the aliases take the same format as module names, they may
    include path separators: in this case, there is no requirement for any part
    of the path named to exist as the alias will be resolved first. For example,
    `<b>any/old/alias</b>' is always a valid alias.</p>
<p class="Pp">Dependencies added to aliased modules are actually added to the
    resolved module; these remain if the alias is removed. It is valid to create
    an alias whose name is one of the standard shell modules and which resolves
    to a different module. However, if a module has dependencies, it will not be
    possible to use the module name as an alias as the module will already be
    marked as a loadable module in its own right.</p>
<p class="Pp">Apart from the above, aliases can be used in the <b>zmodload</b>
    command anywhere module names are required. However, aliases will not be
    shown in lists of loaded modules with a bare `<b>zmodload</b>'.</p>

  <dd>For each <i>modalias</i> argument that was previously defined as a module

</dl>
<p class="Pp">Note that <b>zsh</b> makes no distinction between modules that
    were linked into the shell and modules that are loaded dynamically. In both
    cases this builtin command has to be used to make available the builtins and
    other things defined by modules (unless the module is autoloaded on these
    definitions). This is true even for systems that don't support dynamic
    loading of modules.</p>
