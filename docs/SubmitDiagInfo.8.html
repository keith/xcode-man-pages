<code class="Nm">SubmitDiagInfo</code> is a system process which runs
  periodically. If the user has opted-in for automatic reporting of diagnostic
  and usage information, then <code class="Nm">SubmitDiagInfo</code> collects
  and sends to Apple any recent diagnostic information which has not yet been
  sent to Apple. <code class="Nm">SubmitDiagInfo</code> also cleans up any
  diagnostic and usage information which was created more than one month ago and
  is no longer needed.
<p class="Pp">Sending diagnostic and usage reports to Apple helps us improve the
    quality and performance of our products and services. It helps Apple
    identify common usage trends and issues that enable us to allocate our
    resources efficiently, and it helps us provide better support services to
    you and other customers. All of the diagnostic and usage information is
    collected anonymously from your computer in a way that does not personally
    identify you. Reports may include the following information:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<ul class="Bl-dash Bl-compact">
  <li>Details about application or system crashes, freezes, or kernel
    panics.</li>
  <li>Information about events on your computer (e.g. whether a certain
      function, such as waking your computer was successful or not).</li>
  <li>Usage information (e.g. data about how Apple and third party software,
      hardware and services are being used).</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">Automatic reporting of diagnostic information is off by default
    and no information is sent to Apple unless a user has opted-in to automatic
    collection of diagnostic information. A user is offered the opportunity to
    opt-in for automatic collection of additional diagnostic and usage
    information after the user has manually sent a crash, hang or panic report
    to Apple. Users may at any time opt in or out of automatic reporting in the
    Security &amp; Privacy pane of the System Preferences application under the
    &quot;Privacy&quot; tab.</p>
<p class="Pp">All diagnostic and usage information which is eligible for
    automatic reporting is visible in the Console application under the
    &quot;DIAGNOSTIC AND USAGE INFORMATION&quot; heading in the application's
    sidebar. (The information appears here even if a user has not yet opted-in
    for automatic reporting.) For security purposes, some system diagnostic
    information will only be visible to admin users and will only be submitted
    when an admin user is logged in.</p>
<p class="Pp">Users who need technical support should use
    http://www.apple.com/support or other authorized support channels.
    Developers who are ADC members should submit bug reports using
    http://bugreporter.apple.com in order to allow for two way communication
    between Apple and the bug reporter.</p>
