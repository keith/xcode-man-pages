<p class="Pp"><b>Bash</b> is an <b>sh</b>-compatible command language
    interpreter that executes commands read from the standard input or from a
    file. <b>Bash</b> also incorporates useful features from the <i>Korn</i> and
    <i>C</i> shells (<b>ksh</b> and <b>csh</b>).</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Bash</b> is intended to be a conformant implementation of the
    Shell and Utilities portion of the IEEE POSIX specification (IEEE Standard
    1003.1). <b>Bash</b> can be configured to be POSIX-conformant by
  default.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">In addition to the single-character shell options documented in
    the description of the <b>set</b> builtin command, <b>bash</b> interprets
    the following options when it is invoked:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="c"><a class="permalink" href="#c"><b>-c</b><i> string</i></a></dt>
  <dd>If the <b>-c</b> option is present, then commands are read from
      <i>string</i>. If there are arguments after the <i>string</i>, they are
      assigned to the positional parameters, starting with <b>$0</b>.</dd>
  <dt id="i"><a class="permalink" href="#i"><b>-i</b></a></dt>
  <dd>If the <b>-i</b> option is present, the shell is <i>interactive</i>.</dd>
  <dt id="l"><a class="permalink" href="#l"><b>-l</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Make <b>bash</b> act as if it had been invoked as a login shell (see
      <small><b>INVOCATION</b></small> below).</dd>
  <dt id="r"><a class="permalink" href="#r"><b>-r</b></a></dt>
  <dd>If the <b>-r</b> option is present, the shell becomes <i>restricted</i>
      (see <small><b>RESTRICTED SHELL</b></small> below).</dd>
  <dt id="s"><a class="permalink" href="#s"><b>-s</b></a></dt>
  <dd>If the <b>-s</b> option is present, or if no arguments remain after option
      processing, then commands are read from the standard input. This option
      allows the positional parameters to be set when invoking an interactive
      shell.</dd>
  <dt id="D"><a class="permalink" href="#D"><b>-D</b></a></dt>
  <dd>A list of all double-quoted strings preceded by <b>$</b> is printed on the
      standard output. These are the strings that are subject to language
      translation when the current locale is not <b>C</b> or <b>POSIX</b>. This
      implies the <b>-n</b> option; no commands will be executed.</dd>
  <dt><b>[-+]O [<i>shopt_option</i>]</b></dt>
  <dd><i>shopt_option</i> is one of the shell options accepted by the
      <b>shopt</b> builtin (see <small><b>SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</b></small>
      below). If <i>shopt_option</i> is present, <b>-O</b> sets the value of
      that option; <b>+O</b> unsets it. If <i>shopt_option</i> is not supplied,
      the names and values of the shell options accepted by <b>shopt</b> are
      printed on the standard output. If the invocation option is <b>+O</b>, the
      output is displayed in a format that may be reused as input.</dd>
  <dt><b>--</b></dt>
  <dd>A <b>--</b> signals the end of options and disables further option
      processing. Any arguments after the <b>--</b> are treated as filenames and
      arguments. An argument of <b>-</b> is equivalent to <b>--</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp"><b>Bash</b> also interprets a number of multi-character options.
    These options must appear on the command line before the single-character
    options to be recognized.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="ARGUMENTS"><a class="permalink" href="#ARGUMENTS">ARGUMENTS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">If arguments remain after option processing, and neither the
    <b>-c</b> nor the <b>-s</b> option has been supplied, the first argument is
    assumed to be the name of a file containing shell commands. If <b>bash</b>
    is invoked in this fashion, <b>$0</b> is set to the name of the file, and
    the positional parameters are set to the remaining arguments. <b>Bash</b>
    reads and executes commands from this file, then exits. <b>Bash</b>'s exit
    status is the exit status of the last command executed in the script. If no
    commands are executed, the exit status is 0. An attempt is first made to
    open the file in the current directory, and, if no file is found, then the
    shell searches the directories in <small><b>PATH</b></small> for the
  script.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="INVOCATION"><a class="permalink" href="#INVOCATION">INVOCATION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">A <i>login shell</i> is one whose first character of argument zero
    is a <b>-</b>, or one started with the <b>--login</b> option.</p>
<p class="Pp">An <i>interactive</i> shell is one started without non-option
    arguments and without the <b>-c</b> option whose standard input and error
    are both connected to terminals (as determined by <i>isatty</i>(3)), or one
    started with the <b>-i</b> option. <small><b>PS1</b></small> is set and
    <b>$-</b> includes <b>i</b> if <b>bash</b> is interactive, allowing a shell
    script or a startup file to test this state.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following paragraphs describe how <b>bash</b> executes its
    startup files. If any of the files exist but cannot be read, <b>bash</b>
    reports an error. Tildes are expanded in file names as described below under
    <b>Tilde Expansion</b> in the <small><b>EXPANSION</b></small> section.</p>
<p class="Pp">When <b>bash</b> is invoked as an interactive login shell, or as a
    non-interactive shell with the <b>--login</b> option, it first reads and
    executes commands from the file <i>/etc/profile</i>, if that file exists.
    After reading that file, it looks for <i>~/.bash_profile</i>,
    <i>~/.bash_login</i>, and <i>~/.profile</i>, in that order, and reads and
    executes commands from the first one that exists and is readable. The
    <b>--noprofile</b> option may be used when the shell is started to inhibit
    this behavior.</p>
<p class="Pp">When a login shell exits, <b>bash</b> reads and executes commands
    from the file <i>~/.bash_logout</i>, if it exists.</p>
<p class="Pp">When an interactive shell that is not a login shell is started,
    <b>bash</b> reads and executes commands from <i>~/.bashrc</i>, if that file
    exists. This may be inhibited by using the <b>--norc</b> option. The
    <b>--rcfile</b> <i>file</i> option will force <b>bash</b> to read and
    execute commands from <i>file</i> instead of <i>~/.bashrc</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">When <b>bash</b> is started non-interactively, to run a shell
    script, for example, it looks for the variable
    <small><b>BASH_ENV</b></small> in the environment, expands its value if it
    appears there, and uses the expanded value as the name of a file to read and
    execute. <b>Bash</b> behaves as if the following command were executed:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">if [ -n &quot;$BASH_ENV&quot; ]; then .
  &quot;$BASH_ENV&quot;; fi</div>
<p class="Pp">but the value of the <small><b>PATH</b></small> variable is not
    used to search for the file name.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <b>bash</b> is invoked with the name <b>sh</b>, it tries to
    mimic the startup behavior of historical versions of <b>sh</b> as closely as
    possible, while conforming to the POSIX standard as well. When invoked as an
    interactive login shell, or a non-interactive shell with the <b>--login</b>
    option, it first attempts to read and execute commands from
    <i>/etc/profile</i> and <i>~/.profile</i>, in that order. The
    <b>--noprofile</b> option may be used to inhibit this behavior. When invoked
    as an interactive shell with the name <b>sh</b>, <b>bash</b> looks for the
    variable <b>ENV</b>, expands its value if it is defined, and uses the
    expanded value as the name of a file to read and execute. Since a shell
    invoked as <b>sh</b> does not attempt to read and execute commands from any
    other startup files, the <b>--rcfile</b> option has no effect. A
    non-interactive shell invoked with the name <b>sh</b> does not attempt to
    read any other startup files. When invoked as <b>sh</b>, <b>bash</b> enters
    <i>posix</i> mode after the startup files are read.</p>
<p class="Pp">When <b>bash</b> is started in <i>posix</i> mode, as with the
    <b>--posix</b> command line option, it follows the POSIX standard for
    startup files. In this mode, interactive shells expand the
    <small><b>ENV</b></small> variable and commands are read and executed from
    the file whose name is the expanded value. No other startup files are
  read.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Bash</b> attempts to determine when it is being run by the
    remote shell daemon, usually <i>rshd</i>. If <b>bash</b> determines it is
    being run by <i>rshd</i>, it reads and executes commands from
    <i>~/.bashrc</i>, if that file exists and is readable. It will not do this
    if invoked as <b>sh</b>. The <b>--norc</b> option may be used to inhibit
    this behavior, and the <b>--rcfile</b> option may be used to force another
    file to be read, but <i>rshd</i> does not generally invoke the shell with
    those options or allow them to be specified.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the shell is started with the effective user (group) id not
    equal to the real user (group) id, and the <b>-p</b> option is not supplied,
    no startup files are read, shell functions are not inherited from the
    environment, the <small><b>SHELLOPTS</b></small> variable, if it appears in
    the environment, is ignored, and the effective user id is set to the real
    user id. If the <b>-p</b> option is supplied at invocation, the startup
    behavior is the same, but the effective user id is not reset.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Simple_Commands"><a class="permalink" href="#Simple_Commands">Simple
  Commands</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">A <i>simple command</i> is a sequence of optional variable
    assignments followed by <b>blank</b>-separated words and redirections, and
    terminated by a <i>control operator</i>. The first word specifies the
    command to be executed, and is passed as argument zero. The remaining words
    are passed as arguments to the invoked command.</p>
<p class="Pp">The return value of a <i>simple command</i> is its exit status, or
    128+<i>n</i> if the command is terminated by signal <i>n</i>.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Pipelines"><a class="permalink" href="#Pipelines">Pipelines</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">A <i>pipeline</i> is a sequence of one or more commands separated
    by the character <b>|</b>. The format for a pipeline is:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">[<b>time</b> [<b>-p</b>]] [ ! ] <i>command</i> [ <b>|</b>
    <i>command2</i> ... ]</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The standard output of <i>command</i> is connected via a pipe to
    the standard input of <i>command2</i>. This connection is performed before
    any redirections specified by the command (see
    <small><b>REDIRECTION</b></small> below).</p>
<p class="Pp">The return status of a pipeline is the exit status of the last
    command, unless the <b>pipefail</b> option is enabled. If <b>pipefail</b> is
    enabled, the pipeline's return status is the value of the last (rightmost)
    command to exit with a non-zero status, or zero if all commands exit
    successfully. If the reserved word <b>!</b> precedes a pipeline, the exit
    status of that pipeline is the logical negation of the exit status as
    described above. The shell waits for all commands in the pipeline to
    terminate before returning a value.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the <b>time</b> reserved word precedes a pipeline, the elapsed
    as well as user and system time consumed by its execution are reported when
    the pipeline terminates. The <b>-p</b> option changes the output format to
    that specified by POSIX. The <small><b>TIMEFORMAT</b></small> variable may
    be set to a format string that specifies how the timing information should
    be displayed; see the description of <small><b>TIMEFORMAT</b></small> under
    <b>Shell Variables</b> below.</p>
<p class="Pp">Each command in a pipeline is executed as a separate process
    (i.e., in a subshell).</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Lists"><a class="permalink" href="#Lists">Lists</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">A <i>list</i> is a sequence of one or more pipelines separated by
    one of the operators <b>;</b>, <b>&amp;</b>, <b>&amp;&amp;</b>, or
    <b>&#x23AA;&#x23AA;</b>, and optionally terminated by one of <b>;</b>,
    <b>&amp;</b>, or <b>&lt;newline&gt;</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Of these list operators, <b>&amp;&amp;</b> and
    <b>&#x23AA;&#x23AA;</b> have equal precedence, followed by <b>;</b> and
    <b>&amp;,</b> which have equal precedence.</p>
<p class="Pp">A sequence of one or more newlines may appear in a <i>list</i>
    instead of a semicolon to delimit commands.</p>
<p class="Pp">If a command is terminated by the control operator <b>&amp;</b>,
    the shell executes the command in the <i>background</i> in a subshell. The
    shell does not wait for the command to finish, and the return status is 0.
    Commands separated by a <b>;</b> are executed sequentially; the shell waits
    for each command to terminate in turn. The return status is the exit status
    of the last command executed.</p>
<p class="Pp">The control operators <b>&amp;&amp;</b> and
    <b>&#x23AA;&#x23AA;</b> denote AND lists and OR lists, respectively. An AND
    list has the form</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp"><i>command1</i> <b>&amp;&amp;</b> <i>command2</i></p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>command2</i> is executed if, and only if, <i>command1</i>

<p class="Pp">An OR list has the form</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp"><i>command1</i> <b>&#x23AA;&#x23AA;</b> <i>command2</i></p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>command2</i> is executed if and only if <i>command1</i> returns
    a non-zero exit status. The return status of AND and OR lists is the exit
    status of the last command executed in the list.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Compound_Commands"><a class="permalink" href="#Compound_Commands">Compound
  Commands</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">A <i>compound command</i> is one of the following:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>(<i>list</i>)</dt>
  <dd><i>list</i> is executed in a subshell environment (see <small><b>COMMAND
      EXECUTION ENVIRONMENT</b></small> below). Variable assignments and builtin
      commands that affect the shell's environment do not remain in effect after
      the command completes. The return status is the exit status of
      <i>list</i>.</dd>
  <dt>{ <i>list</i>; }</dt>
  <dd><i>list</i> is simply executed in the current shell environment.
      <i>list</i> must be terminated with a newline or semicolon. This is known
      as a <i>group command</i>. The return status is the exit status of
      <i>list</i>. Note that unlike the metacharacters <b>(</b> and <b>)</b>,
      <b>{</b> and <b>}</b> are <i>reserved words</i> and must occur where a
      reserved word is permitted to be recognized. Since they do not cause a
      word break, they must be separated from <i>list</i> by whitespace.</dd>
  <dt>((<i>expression</i>))</dt>
  <dd>The <i>expression</i> is evaluated according to the rules described below
      under <b>ARITHMETIC EVALUATION</b>. If the value of the expression is
      non-zero, the return status is 0; otherwise the return status is 1. This
      is exactly equivalent to <b>let
    &quot;</b><i>expression</i><b>&quot;</b>.</dd>
  <dt><b>[[</b> <i>expression</i> <b>]]</b></dt>
  <dd>Return a status of 0 or 1 depending on the evaluation of the conditional
      expression <i>expression</i>. Expressions are composed of the primaries
      described below under <b>CONDITIONAL EXPRESSIONS</b>. Word splitting and
      pathname expansion are not performed on the words between the <b>[[</b>
      and <b>]]</b>; tilde expansion, parameter and variable expansion,
      arithmetic expansion, command substitution, process substitution, and
      quote removal are performed. Conditional operators such as <b>-f</b> must
      be unquoted to be recognized as primaries.
    <p class="Pp">When the <b>==</b> and <b>!=</b> operators are used, the
        string to the right of the operator is considered a pattern and matched
        according to the rules described below under <b>Pattern Matching</b>. If
        the shell option <b>nocasematch</b> is enabled, the match is performed
        without regard to the case of alphabetic characters. The return value is
        0 if the string matches (<b>==</b>) or does not match (<b>!=</b>) the
        pattern, and 1 otherwise. Any part of the pattern may be quoted to force
        it to be matched as a string.</p>
    <p class="Pp">An additional binary operator, <b>=~</b>, is available, with
        the same precedence as <b>==</b> and <b>!=</b>. When it is used, the
        string to the right of the operator is considered an extended regular
        expression and matched accordingly (as in <i>regex</i>(3)). The return
        value is 0 if the string matches the pattern, and 1 otherwise. If the
        regular expression is syntactically incorrect, the conditional
        expression's return value is 2. If the shell option <b>nocasematch</b>
        is enabled, the match is performed without regard to the case of
        alphabetic characters. Substrings matched by parenthesized

  Function Definitions</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">A shell function is an object that is called like a simple command
    and executes a compound command with a new set of positional parameters.
    Shell functions are declared as follows:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>[ <b>function</b> ] <i>name</i> () <i>compound-command</i>
    [<i>redirection</i>]</dt>
  <dd>This defines a function named <i>name</i>. The reserved word
      <b>function</b> is optional. If the <b>function</b> reserved word is
      supplied, the parentheses are optional. The <i>body</i> of the function is
      the compound command <i>compound-command</i> (see <b>Compound Commands</b>
      above). That command is usually a <i>list</i> of commands between { and },
      but may be any command listed under <b>Compound Commands</b> above.
      <i>compound-command</i> is executed whenever <i>name</i> is specified as
      the name of a simple command. Any redirections (see
      <small><b>REDIRECTION</b></small> below) specified when a function is
      defined are performed when the function is executed. The exit status of a
      function definition is zero unless a syntax error occurs or a readonly
      function with the same name already exists. When executed, the exit status
      of a function is the exit status of the last command executed in the body.

<p class="Pp">In a non-interactive shell, or an interactive shell in which the
    <b>interactive_comments</b> option to the <b>shopt</b> builtin is enabled
    (see <small><b>SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</b></small> below), a word beginning
    with <b>#</b> causes that word and all remaining characters on that line to
    be ignored. An interactive shell without the <b>interactive_comments</b>
    option enabled does not allow comments. The <b>interactive_comments</b>
    option is on by default in interactive shells.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="QUOTING"><a class="permalink" href="#QUOTING">QUOTING</a></h1>
<p class="Pp"><i>Quoting</i> is used to remove the special meaning of certain
    characters or words to the shell. Quoting can be used to disable special
    treatment for special characters, to prevent reserved words from being
    recognized as such, and to prevent parameter expansion.</p>
<p class="Pp">Each of the <i>metacharacters</i> listed above under
    <small><b>DEFINITIONS</b></small> has special meaning to the shell and must
    be quoted if it is to represent itself.</p>
<p class="Pp">When the command history expansion facilities are being used (see
    <small><b>HISTORY EXPANSION</b></small> below), the <i>history expansion</i>
    character, usually <b>!</b>, must be quoted to prevent history
  expansion.</p>
<p class="Pp">There are three quoting mechanisms: the <i>escape character</i>,
    single quotes, and double quotes.</p>
<p class="Pp">A non-quoted backslash (<b>\</b>) is the <i>escape character</i>.
    It preserves the literal value of the next character that follows, with the
    exception of &lt;newline&gt;. If a <b>\</b>&lt;newline&gt; pair appears, and
    the backslash is not itself quoted, the <b>\</b>&lt;newline&gt; is treated
    as a line continuation (that is, it is removed from the input stream and
    effectively ignored).</p>
<p class="Pp">Enclosing characters in single quotes preserves the literal value
    of each character within the quotes. A single quote may not occur between
    single quotes, even when preceded by a backslash.</p>
<p class="Pp">Enclosing characters in double quotes preserves the literal value
    of all characters within the quotes, with the exception of <b>$</b>,
    <b>`</b>, <b>\</b>, and, when history expansion is enabled, <b>!</b>. The
    characters <b>$</b> and <b>`</b> retain their special meaning within double
    quotes. The backslash retains its special meaning only when followed by one
    of the following characters: <b>$</b>, <b>`</b>, <b>&quot;</b>, <b>\</b>, or
    <b>&lt;newline&gt;</b>. A double quote may be quoted within double quotes by
    preceding it with a backslash. If enabled, history expansion will be
    performed unless an <b>!</b> appearing in double quotes is escaped using a
    backslash. The backslash preceding the <b>!</b> is not removed.</p>
<p class="Pp">The special parameters <b>*</b> and <b>@</b> have special meaning
    when in double quotes (see <small><b>PARAMETERS</b></small> below).</p>
<p class="Pp">Words of the form <b>$</b>'<i>string</i>' are treated specially.
    The word expands to <i>string</i>, with backslash-escaped characters
    replaced as specified by the ANSI C standard. Backslash escape sequences, if
    present, are decoded as follows:</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="PARAMETERS"><a class="permalink" href="#PARAMETERS">PARAMETERS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">A <i>parameter</i> is an entity that stores values. It can be a

    <b>Special Parameters</b>. A <i>variable</i> is a parameter denoted by a
    <i>name</i>. A variable has a <i>value</i> and zero or more
    <i>attributes</i>. Attributes are assigned using the <b>declare</b> builtin
    command (see <b>declare</b> below in <b>SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</b>).</p>
<p class="Pp">A parameter is set if it has been assigned a value. The null
    string is a valid value. Once a variable is set, it may be unset only by
    using the <b>unset</b> builtin command (see <small><b>SHELL BUILTIN
    COMMANDS</b></small> below).</p>
<p class="Pp">A <i>variable</i> may be assigned to by a statement of the
  form</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp"><i>name</i>=[<i>value</i>]</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">If <i>value</i> is not given, the variable is assigned the null
    string. All <i>values</i> undergo tilde expansion, parameter and variable
    expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion, and quote removal
    (see <small><b>EXPANSION</b></small> below). If the variable has its
    <b>integer</b> attribute set, then <i>value</i> is evaluated as an
    arithmetic expression even if the $((...)) expansion is not used (see
    <b>Arithmetic Expansion</b> below). Word splitting is not performed, with
    the exception of <b>&quot;$@&quot;</b> as explained below under <b>Special
    Parameters</b>. Pathname expansion is not performed. Assignment statements
    may also appear as arguments to the <b>alias</b>, <b>declare</b>,
    <b>typeset</b>, <b>export</b>, <b>readonly</b>, and <b>local</b> builtin
    commands.</p>
<p class="Pp">In the context where an assignment statement is assigning a value
    to a shell variable or array index, the += operator can be used to append to
    or add to the variable's previous value. When += is applied to a variable
    for which the integer attribute has been set, <i>value</i> is evaluated as
    an arithmetic expression and added to the variable's current value, which is
    also evaluated. When += is applied to an array variable using compound
    assignment (see <b>Arrays</b> below), the variable's value is not unset (as
    it is when using =), and new values are appended to the array beginning at
    one greater than the array's maximum index. When applied to a string-valued
    variable, <i>value</i> is expanded and appended to the variable's value.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Positional_Parameters"><a class="permalink" href="#Positional_Parameters">Positional
  Parameters</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">A <i>positional parameter</i> is a parameter denoted by one or
    more digits, other than the single digit 0. Positional parameters are
    assigned from the shell's arguments when it is invoked, and may be
    reassigned using the <b>set</b> builtin command. Positional parameters may
    not be assigned to with assignment statements. The positional parameters are
    temporarily replaced when a shell function is executed (see
    <small><b>FUNCTIONS</b></small> below).</p>
<p class="Pp">When a positional parameter consisting of more than a single digit
    is expanded, it must be enclosed in braces (see

      list. A value of <i>ignoredups</i> causes lines matching the previous
      history entry to not be saved. A value of <i>ignoreboth</i> is shorthand
      for <i>ignorespace</i> and <i>ignoredups</i>. A value of <i>erasedups</i>
      causes all previous lines matching the current line to be removed from the
      history list before that line is saved. Any value not in the above list is
      ignored. If <b>HISTCONTROL</b> is unset, or does not include a valid
      value, all lines read by the shell parser are saved on the history list,

      `<b>*</b>' is appended). Each pattern is tested against the line after the
      checks specified by <b>HISTCONTROL</b> are applied. In addition to the
      normal shell pattern matching characters, `<b>&amp;</b>' matches the
      previous history line. `<b>&amp;</b>' may be escaped using a backslash;
      the backslash is removed before attempting a match. The second and

  <dd>Contains the name of a file in the same format as <i>/etc/hosts</i> that
      should be read when the shell needs to complete a hostname. The list of
      possible hostname completions may be changed while the shell is running;
      the next time hostname completion is attempted after the value is changed,
      <b>bash</b> adds the contents of the new file to the existing list. If
      <small><b>HOSTFILE</b></small> is set, but has no value, <b>bash</b>
      attempts to read <i>/etc/hosts</i> to obtain the list of possible hostname

<h2 class="Ss" id="Arrays"><a class="permalink" href="#Arrays">Arrays</a></h2>
<p class="Pp"><b>Bash</b> provides one-dimensional array variables. Any variable
    may be used as an array; the <b>declare</b> builtin will explicitly declare
    an array. There is no maximum limit on the size of an array, nor any
    requirement that members be indexed or assigned contiguously. Arrays are
    indexed using integers and are zero-based.</p>
<p class="Pp">An array is created automatically if any variable is assigned to
    using the syntax <i>name</i>[<i>subscript</i>]=<i>value</i>. The
    <i>subscript</i> is treated as an arithmetic expression that must evaluate
    to a number greater than or equal to zero. To explicitly declare an array,
    use <b>declare -a <i>name</i></b> (see <small><b>SHELL BUILTIN
    COMMANDS</b></small> below). <b>declare -a <i>name</i>[<i>subscript</i>]</b>
    is also accepted; the <i>subscript</i> is ignored. Attributes may be
    specified for an array variable using the <b>declare</b> and <b>readonly</b>
    builtins. Each attribute applies to all members of an array.</p>
<p class="Pp">Arrays are assigned to using compound assignments of the form
    <i>name</i>=<b>(</b>value<i>1</i> ... value<i>n</i><b>)</b>, where each
    <i>value</i> is of the form [<i>subscript</i>]=<i>string</i>. Only
    <i>string</i> is required. If the optional brackets and subscript are
    supplied, that index is assigned to; otherwise the index of the element
    assigned is the last index assigned to by the statement plus one. Indexing
    starts at zero. This syntax is also accepted by the <b>declare</b> builtin.
    Individual array elements may be assigned to using the
    <i>name</i>[<i>subscript</i>]=<i>value</i> syntax introduced above.</p>
<p class="Pp">Any element of an array may be referenced using
    ${<i>name</i>[<i>subscript</i>]}. The braces are required to avoid conflicts
    with pathname expansion. If <i>subscript</i> is <b>@</b> or <b>*</b>, the
    word expands to all members of <i>name</i>. These subscripts differ only
    when the word appears within double quotes. If the word is double-quoted,
    ${<i>name</i>[*]} expands to a single word with the value of each array
    member separated by the first character of the <small><b>IFS</b></small>
    special variable, and ${<i>name</i>[@]} expands each element of <i>name</i>
    to a separate word. When there are no array members, ${<i>name</i>[@]}
    expands to nothing. If the double-quoted expansion occurs within a word, the
    expansion of the first parameter is joined with the beginning part of the
    original word, and the expansion of the last parameter is joined with the
    last part of the original word. This is analogous to the expansion of the
    special parameters <b>*</b> and <b>@</b> (see <b>Special Parameters</b>
    above). ${#<i>name</i>[<i>subscript</i>]} expands to the length of
    ${<i>name</i>[<i>subscript</i>]}. If <i>subscript</i> is <b>*</b> or
    <b>@</b>, the expansion is the number of elements in the array. Referencing
    an array variable without a subscript is equivalent to referencing element
    zero.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>unset</b> builtin is used to destroy arrays. <b>unset</b>
    <i>name</i>[<i>subscript</i>] destroys the array element at index
    <i>subscript</i>. Care must be taken to avoid unwanted side effects caused
    by filename generation. <b>unset</b> <i>name</i>, where <i>name</i> is an
    array, or <b>unset</b> <i>name</i>[<i>subscript</i>], where <i>subscript</i>
    is <b>*</b> or <b>@</b>, removes the entire array.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>declare</b>, <b>local</b>, and <b>readonly</b> builtins
    each accept a <b>-a</b> option to specify an array. The <b>read</b> builtin
    accepts a <b>-a</b> option to assign a list of words read from the standard
    input to an array. The <b>set</b> and <b>declare</b> builtins display array
    values in a way that allows them to be reused as assignments.</p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="EXPANSION"><a class="permalink" href="#EXPANSION">EXPANSION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Expansion is performed on the command line after it has been split
    into words. There are seven kinds of expansion performed: <i>brace
    expansion</i>, <i>tilde expansion</i>, <i>parameter and variable
    expansion</i>, <i>command substitution</i>, <i>arithmetic expansion</i>,
    <i>word splitting</i>, and <i>pathname expansion</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The order of expansions is: brace expansion, tilde expansion,
    parameter, variable and arithmetic expansion and command substitution (done
    in a left-to-right fashion), word splitting, and pathname expansion.</p>
<p class="Pp">On systems that can support it, there is an additional expansion
    available: <i>process substitution</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Only brace expansion, word splitting, and pathname expansion can
    change the number of words of the expansion; other expansions expand a
    single word to a single word. The only exceptions to this are the expansions
    of &quot;<b>$@</b>&quot; and &quot;<b>${</b><i>name</i><b>[@]}</b>&quot; as
    explained above (see <b>PARAMETERS</b>).</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Brace_Expansion"><a class="permalink" href="#Brace_Expansion">Brace
  Expansion</a></h2>
<p class="Pp"><i>Brace expansion</i> is a mechanism by which arbitrary strings
    may be generated. This mechanism is similar to <i>pathname expansion</i>,
    but the filenames generated need not exist. Patterns to be brace expanded
    take the form of an optional <i>preamble</i>, followed by either a series of
    comma-separated strings or a sequence expression between a pair of braces,
    followed by an optional <i>postscript</i>. The preamble is prefixed to each
    string contained within the braces, and the postscript is then appended to
    each resulting string, expanding left to right.</p>
<p class="Pp">Brace expansions may be nested. The results of each expanded
    string are not sorted; left to right order is preserved. For example,
    a<b>{</b>d,c,b<b>}</b>e expands into `ade ace abe'.</p>
<p class="Pp">A sequence expression takes the form
    <b>{</b><i>x</i><b>..</b><i>y</i><b>}</b>, where <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> are
    either integers or single characters. When integers are supplied, the
    expression expands to each number between <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>, inclusive.
    When characters are supplied, the expression expands to each character
    lexicographically between <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>, inclusive. Note that both
    <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> must be of the same type.</p>
<p class="Pp">Brace expansion is performed before any other expansions, and any
    characters special to other expansions are preserved in the result. It is
    strictly textual. <b>Bash</b> does not apply any syntactic interpretation to
    the context of the expansion or the text between the braces.</p>
<p class="Pp">A correctly-formed brace expansion must contain unquoted opening
    and closing braces, and at least one unquoted comma or a valid sequence
    expression. Any incorrectly formed brace expansion is left unchanged. A
    <b>{</b> or <b>,</b> may be quoted with a backslash to prevent its being
    considered part of a brace expression. To avoid conflicts with parameter
    expansion, the string <b>${</b> is not considered eligible for brace
    expansion.</p>
<p class="Pp">This construct is typically used as shorthand when the common
    prefix of the strings to be generated is longer than in the above
  example:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">mkdir /usr/local/src/bash/{old,new,dist,bugs}</p>
</div>
or
<div class="Bd-indent">chown root /usr/{ucb/{ex,edit},lib/{ex?.?*,how_ex}}</div>
<p class="Pp">Brace expansion introduces a slight incompatibility with
    historical versions of <b>sh</b>. <b>sh</b> does not treat opening or
    closing braces specially when they appear as part of a word, and preserves
    them in the output. <b>Bash</b> removes braces from words as a consequence
    of brace expansion. For example, a word entered to <b>sh</b> as
    <i>file{1,2}</i> appears identically in the output. The same word is output
    as <i>file1 file2</i> after expansion by <b>bash</b>. If strict
    compatibility with <b>sh</b> is desired, start <b>bash</b> with the
    <b>+B</b> option or disable brace expansion with the <b>+B</b> option to the
    <b>set</b> command (see <small><b>SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</b></small>
  below).</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Tilde_Expansion"><a class="permalink" href="#Tilde_Expansion">Tilde
  Expansion</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">If a word begins with an unquoted tilde character (`<b>~</b>'),
    all of the characters preceding the first unquoted slash (or all characters,
    if there is no unquoted slash) are considered a <i>tilde-prefix</i>. If none
    of the characters in the tilde-prefix are quoted, the characters in the
    tilde-prefix following the tilde are treated as a possible <i>login
    name</i>. If this login name is the null string, the tilde is replaced with
    the value of the shell parameter <b>HOME</b>. If <small><b>HOME</b></small>
    is unset, the home directory of the user executing the shell is substituted
    instead. Otherwise, the tilde-prefix is replaced with the home directory
    associated with the specified login name.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the tilde-prefix is a `~+', the value of the shell variable
    <small><b>PWD</b></small> replaces the tilde-prefix. If the tilde-prefix is
    a `~-', the value of the shell variable <b>OLDPWD</b>, if it is set, is
    substituted. If the characters following the tilde in the tilde-prefix
    consist of a number <i>N</i>, optionally prefixed by a `+' or a `-', the
    tilde-prefix is replaced with the corresponding element from the directory
    stack, as it would be displayed by the <b>dirs</b> builtin invoked with the
    tilde-prefix as an argument. If the characters following the tilde in the
    tilde-prefix consist of a number without a leading `+' or `-', `+' is
    assumed.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the login name is invalid, or the tilde expansion fails, the
    word is unchanged.</p>
<p class="Pp">Each variable assignment is checked for unquoted tilde-prefixes
    immediately following a <b>:</b> or the first <b>=</b>. In these cases,
    tilde expansion is also performed. Consequently, one may use file names with
    tildes in assignments to <b>PATH</b>, <b>MAILPATH</b>, and <b>CDPATH</b>,
    and the shell assigns the expanded value.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Parameter_Expansion"><a class="permalink" href="#Parameter_Expansion">Parameter

<p class="Pp">The `<b>$</b>' character introduces parameter expansion, command
    substitution, or arithmetic expansion. The parameter name or symbol to be
    expanded may be enclosed in braces, which are optional but serve to protect
    the variable to be expanded from characters immediately following it which
    could be interpreted as part of the name.</p>
<p class="Pp">When braces are used, the matching ending brace is the first
    `<b>}</b>' not escaped by a backslash or within a quoted string, and not
    within an embedded arithmetic expansion, command substitution, or parameter
    expansion.</p>

      interpreted as part of its name.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">If the first character of <i>parameter</i> is an exclamation
    point, a level of variable indirection is introduced. <b>Bash</b> uses the
    value of the variable formed from the rest of <i>parameter</i> as the name
    of the variable; this variable is then expanded and that value is used in

    itself. This is known as <i>indirect expansion</i>. The exceptions to this
    are the expansions of ${!<i>prefix</i>*} and
    ${<b>!</b><i>name</i>[<i>@</i>]} described below. The exclamation point must
    immediately follow the left brace in order to introduce indirection.</p>
<p class="Pp">In each of the cases below, <i>word</i> is subject to tilde
    expansion, parameter expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic

<p class="Pp">The shell scans the results of parameter expansion, command

    sequences of the whitespace characters <b>space</b> and <b>tab</b> are
    ignored at the beginning and end of the word, as long as the whitespace
    character is in the value of <b>IFS</b> (an <small><b>IFS</b></small>
    whitespace character). Any character in <small><b>IFS</b></small> that is
    not <small><b>IFS</b></small> whitespace, along with any adjacent
    <small><b>IFS</b></small> whitespace characters, delimits a field. A

<p class="Pp">After word splitting, unless the <b>-f</b> option has been set,
    <b>bash</b> scans each word for the characters <b>*</b>, <b>?</b>, and
    <b>[</b>. If one of these characters appears, then the word is regarded as a
    <i>pattern</i>, and replaced with an alphabetically sorted list of file
    names matching the pattern. If no matching file names are found, and the
    shell option <b>nullglob</b> is disabled, the word is left unchanged. If the
    <b>nullglob</b> option is set, and no matches are found, the word is
    removed. If the <b>failglob</b> shell option is set, and no matches are
    found, an error message is printed and the command is not executed. If the
    shell option <b>nocaseglob</b> is enabled, the match is performed without
    regard to the case of alphabetic characters. When a pattern is used for
    pathname expansion, the character <b>``.''</b> at the start of a name or
    immediately following a slash must be matched explicitly, unless the shell
    option <b>dotglob</b> is set. When matching a pathname, the slash character
    must always be matched explicitly. In other cases, the <b>``.''</b>
    character is not treated specially. See the description of <b>shopt</b>
    below under <small><b>SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</b></small> for a description
    of the <b>nocaseglob</b>, <b>nullglob</b>, <b>failglob</b>, and
    <b>dotglob</b> shell options.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <small><b>GLOBIGNORE</b></small> shell variable may be used to

    <small><b>GLOBIGNORE</b></small> is set, each matching file name that also
    matches one of the patterns in <small><b>GLOBIGNORE</b></small> is removed
    from the list of matches. The file names <b>``.''</b> and <b>``..''</b> are
    always ignored when <small><b>GLOBIGNORE</b></small> is set and not null.
    However, setting <small><b>GLOBIGNORE</b></small> to a non-null value has
    the effect of enabling the <b>dotglob</b> shell option, so all other file
    names beginning with a <b>``.''</b> will match. To get the old behavior of
    ignoring file names beginning with a <b>``.''</b>, make <b>``.*''</b> one of
    the patterns in <b>GLOBIGNORE</b>. The <b>dotglob</b> option is disabled
    when <small><b>GLOBIGNORE</b></small> is unset.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Pattern Matching</b></p>
<p class="Pp">Any character that appears in a pattern, other than the special
    pattern characters described below, matches itself. The NUL character may
    not occur in a pattern. A backslash escapes the following character; the
    escaping backslash is discarded when matching. The special pattern
    characters must be quoted if they are to be matched literally.</p>
<p class="Pp">The special pattern characters have the following meanings:</p>

<dl class="Bl-tag">

  <dd>Matches any single character.</dd>
  <dt><b>[...]</b></dt>
  <dd>Matches any one of the enclosed characters. A pair of characters separated
      by a hyphen denotes a <i>range expression</i>; any character that sorts
      between those two characters, inclusive, using the current locale's
      collating sequence and character set, is matched. If the first character
      following the <b>[</b> is a <b>!</b> or a <b>^</b> then any character not
      enclosed is matched. The sorting order of characters in range expressions
      is determined by the current locale and the value of the <b>LC_COLLATE</b>
      shell variable, if set. A <b>-</b> may be matched by including it as the
      first or last character in the set. A <b>]</b> may be matched by including
      it as the first character in the set.
    <p class="Pp">Within <b>[</b> and <b>]</b>, <i>character classes</i> can be
        specified using the syntax <b>[:</b><i>class</i><b>:]</b>, where

<p class="Pp">Before a command is executed, its input and output may be
    <i>redirected</i> using a special notation interpreted by the shell.
    Redirection may also be used to open and close files for the current shell
    execution environment. The following redirection operators may precede or
    appear anywhere within a <i>simple command</i> or may follow a
    <i>command</i>. Redirections are processed in the order they appear, from
    left to right.</p>
<p class="Pp">In the following descriptions, if the file descriptor number is
    omitted, and the first character of the redirection operator is <b>&lt;</b>,
    the redirection refers to the standard input (file descriptor 0). If the
    first character of the redirection operator is <b>&gt;</b>, the redirection
    refers to the standard output (file descriptor 1).</p>
<p class="Pp">The word following the redirection operator in the following
    descriptions, unless otherwise noted, is subjected to brace expansion, tilde
    expansion, parameter expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion,
    quote removal, pathname expansion, and word splitting. If it expands to more
    than one word, <b>bash</b> reports an error.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that the order of redirections is significant. For example,
    the command</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">ls <b>&gt;</b> dirlist 2<b>&gt;&amp;</b>1</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">directs both standard output and standard error to the file

<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">ls 2<b>&gt;&amp;</b>1 <b>&gt;</b> dirlist</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">directs only the standard output to file <i>dirlist</i>, because
    the standard error was duplicated as standard output before the standard
    output was redirected to <i>dirlist</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Bash</b> handles several filenames specially when they are used
    in redirections, as described in the following table:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">

<h1 class="Sh" id="ALIASES"><a class="permalink" href="#ALIASES">ALIASES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp"><i>Aliases</i> allow a string to be substituted for a word when it
    is used as the first word of a simple command. The shell maintains a list of
    aliases that may be set and unset with the <b>alias</b> and <b>unalias</b>
    builtin commands (see <small><b>SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</b></small> below).
    The first word of each simple command, if unquoted, is checked to see if it
    has an alias. If so, that word is replaced by the text of the alias. The
    characters <b>/</b>, <b>$</b>, <b>`</b>, and <b>=</b> and any of the shell
    <i>metacharacters</i> or quoting characters listed above may not appear in
    an alias name. The replacement text may contain any valid shell input,
    including shell metacharacters. The first word of the replacement text is
    tested for aliases, but a word that is identical to an alias being expanded
    is not expanded a second time. This means that one may alias <b>ls</b> to
    <b>ls -F</b>, for instance, and <b>bash</b> does not try to recursively
    expand the replacement text. If the last character of the alias value is a
    <i>blank</i>, then the next command word following the alias is also checked
    for alias expansion.</p>
<p class="Pp">Aliases are created and listed with the <b>alias</b> command, and
    removed with the <b>unalias</b> command.</p>
<p class="Pp">There is no mechanism for using arguments in the replacement text.
    If arguments are needed, a shell function should be used (see
    <small><b>FUNCTIONS</b></small> below).</p>
<p class="Pp">Aliases are not expanded when the shell is not interactive, unless
    the <b>expand_aliases</b> shell option is set using <b>shopt</b> (see the
    description of <b>shopt</b> under <small><b>SHELL BUILTIN
    COMMANDS</b></small> below).</p>
<p class="Pp">The rules concerning the definition and use of aliases are
    somewhat confusing. <b>Bash</b> always reads at least one complete line of
    input before executing any of the commands on that line. Aliases are
    expanded when a command is read, not when it is executed. Therefore, an
    alias definition appearing on the same line as another command does not take
    effect until the next line of input is read. The commands following the
    alias definition on that line are not affected by the new alias. This
    behavior is also an issue when functions are executed. Aliases are expanded
    when a function definition is read, not when the function is executed,
    because a function definition is itself a compound command. As a
    consequence, aliases defined in a function are not available until after
    that function is executed. To be safe, always put alias definitions on a
    separate line, and do not use <b>alias</b> in compound commands.</p>
<p class="Pp">For almost every purpose, aliases are superseded by shell
    functions.</p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="FUNCTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#FUNCTIONS">FUNCTIONS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">A shell function, defined as described above under <b>SHELL
    GRAMMAR</b>, stores a series of commands for later execution. When the name
    of a shell function is used as a simple command name, the list of commands
    associated with that function name is executed. Functions are executed in
    the context of the current shell; no new process is created to interpret
    them (contrast this with the execution of a shell script). When a function
    is executed, the arguments to the function become the positional parameters
    during its execution. The special parameter <b>#</b> is updated to reflect
    the change. Special parameter 0 is unchanged. The first element of the
    <small><b>FUNCNAME</b></small> variable is set to the name of the function
    while the function is executing. All other aspects of the shell execution
    environment are identical between a function and its caller with the
    exception that the <small><b>DEBUG</b></small> and <b>RETURN</b> traps (see
    the description of the <b>trap</b> builtin under <small><b>SHELL BUILTIN
    COMMANDS</b></small> below) are not inherited unless the function has been
    given the <b>trace</b> attribute (see the description of the
    <small><b>declare</b></small> builtin below) or the <b>-o functrace</b>
    shell option has been enabled with the <b>set</b> builtin (in which case all
    functions inherit the <b>DEBUG</b> and <b>RETURN</b> traps).</p>
<p class="Pp">Variables local to the function may be declared with the
    <b>local</b> builtin command. Ordinarily, variables and their values are
    shared between the function and its caller.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the builtin command <b>return</b> is executed in a function,
    the function completes and execution resumes with the next command after the
    function call. Any command associated with the <b>RETURN</b> trap is
    executed before execution resumes. When a function completes, the values of
    the positional parameters and the special parameter <b>#</b> are restored to
    the values they had prior to the function's execution.</p>
<p class="Pp">Function names and definitions may be listed with the <b>-f</b>
    option to the <b>declare</b> or <b>typeset</b> builtin commands. The
    <b>-F</b> option to <b>declare</b> or <b>typeset</b> will list the function
    names only (and optionally the source file and line number, if the
    <b>extdebug</b> shell option is enabled). Functions may be exported so that
    subshells automatically have them defined with the <b>-f</b> option to the
    <b>export</b> builtin. A function definition may be deleted using the
    <b>-f</b> option to the <b>unset</b> builtin. Note that shell functions and
    variables with the same name may result in multiple identically-named
    entries in the environment passed to the shell's children. Care should be
    taken in cases where this may cause a problem.</p>
<p class="Pp">Functions may be recursive. No limit is imposed on the number of

<p class="Pp">Shell variables are allowed as operands; parameter expansion is
    performed before the expression is evaluated. Within an expression, shell
    variables may also be referenced by name without using the parameter
    expansion syntax. A shell variable that is null or unset evaluates to 0 when
    referenced by name without using the parameter expansion syntax. The value
    of a variable is evaluated as an arithmetic expression when it is
    referenced, or when a variable which has been given the <i>integer</i>
    attribute using <b>declare -i</b> is assigned a value. A null value
    evaluates to 0. A shell variable need not have its integer attribute turned
    on to be used in an expression.</p>
<p class="Pp">Constants with a leading 0 are interpreted as octal numbers. A
    leading 0x or 0X denotes hexadecimal. Otherwise, numbers take the form
    [<i>base#</i>]n, where <i>base</i> is a decimal number between 2 and 64
    representing the arithmetic base, and <i>n</i> is a number in that base. If
    <i>base#</i> is omitted, then base 10 is used. The digits greater than 9 are
    represented by the lowercase letters, the uppercase letters, @, and _, in
    that order. If <i>base</i> is less than or equal to 36, lowercase and
    uppercase letters may be used interchangeably to represent numbers between
    10 and 35.</p>
<p class="Pp">Operators are evaluated in order of precedence. Sub-expressions in
    parentheses are evaluated first and may override the precedence rules

  COMMAND EXPANSION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">When a simple command is executed, the shell performs the
    following expansions, assignments, and redirections, from left to right.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>1.</dt>
  <dd>The words that the parser has marked as variable assignments (those
      preceding the command name) and redirections are saved for later
      processing.</dd>
  <dt>2.</dt>
  <dd>The words that are not variable assignments or redirections are expanded.
      If any words remain after expansion, the first word is taken to be the

  <dd>Redirections are performed as described above under

  <dt>4.</dt>
  <dd>The text after the <b>=</b> in each variable assignment undergoes tilde
      expansion, parameter expansion, command substitution, arithmetic
      expansion, and quote removal before being assigned to the variable.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">If no command name results, the variable assignments affect the
    current shell environment. Otherwise, the variables are added to the
    environment of the executed command and do not affect the current shell
    environment. If any of the assignments attempts to assign a value to a
    readonly variable, an error occurs, and the command exits with a non-zero
    status.</p>
<p class="Pp">If no command name results, redirections are performed, but do not
    affect the current shell environment. A redirection error causes the command
    to exit with a non-zero status.</p>
<p class="Pp">If there is a command name left after expansion, execution
    proceeds as described below. Otherwise, the command exits. If one of the
    expansions contained a command substitution, the exit status of the command
    is the exit status of the last command substitution performed. If there were
    no command substitutions, the command exits with a status of zero.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="COMMAND_EXECUTION"><a class="permalink" href="#COMMAND_EXECUTION">COMMAND
  EXECUTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">After a command has been split into words, if it results in a
    simple command and an optional list of arguments, the following actions are
    taken.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the command name contains no slashes, the shell attempts to
    locate it. If there exists a shell function by that name, that function is
    invoked as described above in <b>FUNCTIONS</b>. If the name does not match a
    function, the shell searches for it in the list of shell builtins. If a
    match is found, that builtin is invoked.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the name is neither a shell function nor a builtin, and
    contains no slashes, <b>bash</b> searches each element of the
    <small><b>PATH</b></small> for a directory containing an executable file by
    that name. <b>Bash</b> uses a hash table to remember the full pathnames of
    executable files (see <b>hash</b> under <small><b>SHELL BUILTIN
    COMMANDS</b></small> below). A full search of the directories in
    <small><b>PATH</b></small> is performed only if the command is not found in
    the hash table. If the search is unsuccessful, the shell prints an error
    message and returns an exit status of 127.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the search is successful, or if the command name contains one
    or more slashes, the shell executes the named program in a separate
    execution environment. Argument 0 is set to the name given, and the
    remaining arguments to the command are set to the arguments given, if
  any.</p>
<p class="Pp">If this execution fails because the file is not in executable
    format, and the file is not a directory, it is assumed to be a <i>shell
    script</i>, a file containing shell commands. A subshell is spawned to
    execute it. This subshell reinitializes itself, so that the effect is as if
    a new shell had been invoked to handle the script, with the exception that
    the locations of commands remembered by the parent (see <b>hash</b> below
    under <small><b>SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</b>)</small> are retained by the
    child.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the program is a file beginning with <b>#!</b>, the remainder
    of the first line specifies an interpreter for the program. The shell
    executes the specified interpreter on operating systems that do not handle
    this executable format themselves. The arguments to the interpreter consist
    of a single optional argument following the interpreter name on the first
    line of the program, followed by the name of the program, followed by the
    command arguments, if any.</p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="COMMAND_EXECUTION_ENVIRONMENT"><a class="permalink" href="#COMMAND_EXECUTION_ENVIRONMENT">COMMAND
  EXECUTION ENVIRONMENT</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The shell has an <i>execution environment</i>, which consists of
    the following:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>open files inherited by the shell at invocation, as modified by
      redirections supplied to the <b>exec</b> builtin</li>
  <li>the current working directory as set by <b>cd</b>, <b>pushd</b>, or
      <b>popd</b>, or inherited by the shell at invocation</li>
  <li>the file creation mode mask as set by <b>umask</b> or inherited from the
      shell's parent</li>
  <li>current traps set by <b>trap</b></li>
  <li>shell parameters that are set by variable assignment or with <b>set</b> or
      inherited from the shell's parent in the environment</li>
  <li>shell functions defined during execution or inherited from the shell's
      parent in the environment</li>
  <li>options enabled at invocation (either by default or with command-line
      arguments) or by <b>set</b></li>
  <li>options enabled by <b>shopt</b></li>
  <li>shell aliases defined with <b>alias</b></li>
  <li>various process IDs, including those of background jobs, the value of
      <b>$$</b>, and the value of <b>$PPID</b></li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">When a simple command other than a builtin or shell function is to
    be executed, it is invoked in a separate execution environment that consists
    of the following. Unless otherwise noted, the values are inherited from the
    shell.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>the shell's open files, plus any modifications and additions specified by
      redirections to the command</li>
  <li>the current working directory</li>
  <li>the file creation mode mask</li>
  <li>shell variables and functions marked for export, along with variables
      exported for the command, passed in the environment</li>
  <li>traps caught by the shell are reset to the values inherited from the
      shell's parent, and traps ignored by the shell are ignored</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">A command invoked in this separate environment cannot affect the
    shell's execution environment.</p>
<p class="Pp">Command substitution, commands grouped with parentheses, and
    asynchronous commands are invoked in a subshell environment that is a
    duplicate of the shell environment, except that traps caught by the shell
    are reset to the values that the shell inherited from its parent at
    invocation. Builtin commands that are invoked as part of a pipeline are also
    executed in a subshell environment. Changes made to the subshell environment
    cannot affect the shell's execution environment.</p>
<p class="Pp">If a command is followed by a <b>&amp;</b> and job control is not
    active, the default standard input for the command is the empty file
    <i>/dev/null</i>. Otherwise, the invoked command inherits the file
    descriptors of the calling shell as modified by redirections.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="ENVIRONMENT"><a class="permalink" href="#ENVIRONMENT">ENVIRONMENT</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">When a program is invoked it is given an array of strings called
    the <i>environment</i>. This is a list of <i>name</i>-<i>value</i> pairs, of
    the form <i>name=value</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The shell provides several ways to manipulate the environment. On
    invocation, the shell scans its own environment and creates a parameter for
    each name found, automatically marking it for <i>export</i> to child
    processes. Executed commands inherit the environment. The <b>export</b> and
    <b>declare -x</b> commands allow parameters and functions to be added to and
    deleted from the environment. If the value of a parameter in the environment
    is modified, the new value becomes part of the environment, replacing the
    old. The environment inherited by any executed command consists of the
    shell's initial environment, whose values may be modified in the shell, less
    any pairs removed by the <b>unset</b> command, plus any additions via the
    <b>export</b> and <b>declare -x</b> commands.</p>
<p class="Pp">The environment for any <i>simple command</i> or function may be
    augmented temporarily by prefixing it with parameter assignments, as
    described above in <b>PARAMETERS</b>. These assignment statements affect
    only the environment seen by that command.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the <b>-k</b> option is set (see the <b>set</b> builtin command
    below), then <i>all</i> parameter assignments are placed in the environment
    for a command, not just those that precede the command name.</p>
<p class="Pp">When <b>bash</b> invokes an external command, the variable
    <b>_</b> is set to the full file name of the command and passed to that
    command in its environment.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="EXIT_STATUS"><a class="permalink" href="#EXIT_STATUS">EXIT
  STATUS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">For the shell's purposes, a command which exits with a zero exit
    status has succeeded. An exit status of zero indicates success. A non-zero
    exit status indicates failure. When a command terminates on a fatal signal
    <i>N</i>, <b>bash</b> uses the value of 128+<i>N</i> as the exit status.</p>
<p class="Pp">If a command is not found, the child process created to execute it
    returns a status of 127. If a command is found but is not executable, the
    return status is 126.</p>
<p class="Pp">If a command fails because of an error during expansion or
    redirection, the exit status is greater than zero.</p>
<p class="Pp">Shell builtin commands return a status of 0 (<i>true</i>) if
    successful, and non-zero (<i>false</i>) if an error occurs while they
    execute. All builtins return an exit status of 2 to indicate incorrect
    usage.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Bash</b> itself returns the exit status of the last command
    executed, unless a syntax error occurs, in which case it exits with a
    non-zero value. See also the <b>exit</b> builtin command below.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="SIGNALS"><a class="permalink" href="#SIGNALS">SIGNALS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">When <b>bash</b> is interactive, in the absence of any traps, it
    ignores <small><b>SIGTERM</b></small> (so that <b>kill 0</b> does not kill
    an interactive shell), and <small><b>SIGINT</b></small> is caught and
    handled (so that the <b>wait</b> builtin is interruptible). In all cases,
    <b>bash</b> ignores <b>SIGQUIT</b>. If job control is in effect, <b>bash</b>
    ignores <b>SIGTTIN</b>, <b>SIGTTOU</b>, and <b>SIGTSTP</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Non-builtin commands run by <b>bash</b> have signal handlers set
    to the values inherited by the shell from its parent. When job control is
    not in effect, asynchronous commands ignore <small><b>SIGINT</b></small> and
    <small><b>SIGQUIT</b></small> in addition to these inherited handlers.
    Commands run as a result of command substitution ignore the
    keyboard-generated job control signals <b>SIGTTIN</b>, <b>SIGTTOU</b>, and
    <b>SIGTSTP</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The shell exits by default upon receipt of a <b>SIGHUP</b>. Before
    exiting, an interactive shell resends the <small><b>SIGHUP</b></small> to
    all jobs, running or stopped. Stopped jobs are sent
    <small><b>SIGCONT</b></small> to ensure that they receive the <b>SIGHUP</b>.
    To prevent the shell from sending the signal to a particular job, it should
    be removed from the jobs table with the <b>disown</b> builtin (see
    <small><b>SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</b></small> below) or marked to not receive
    <small><b>SIGHUP</b></small> using <b>disown -h</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the <b>huponexit</b> shell option has been set with
    <b>shopt</b>, <b>bash</b> sends a <small><b>SIGHUP</b></small> to all jobs
    when an interactive login shell exits.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <b>bash</b> is waiting for a command to complete and receives a
    signal for which a trap has been set, the trap will not be executed until
    the command completes. When <b>bash</b> is waiting for an asynchronous
    command via the <b>wait</b> builtin, the reception of a signal for which a
    trap has been set will cause the <b>wait</b> builtin to return immediately
    with an exit status greater than 128, immediately after which the trap is
    executed.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="JOB_CONTROL"><a class="permalink" href="#JOB_CONTROL">JOB
  CONTROL</a></h1>
<p class="Pp"><i>Job control</i> refers to the ability to selectively stop
    (<i>suspend</i>) the execution of processes and continue (<i>resume</i>)
    their execution at a later point. A user typically employs this facility via
    an interactive interface supplied jointly by the system's terminal driver
    and <b>bash</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The shell associates a <i>job</i> with each pipeline. It keeps a
    table of currently executing jobs, which may be listed with the <b>jobs</b>
    command. When <b>bash</b> starts a job asynchronously (in the
    <i>background</i>), it prints a line that looks like:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">[1] 25647</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">indicating that this job is job number 1 and that the process ID
    of the last process in the pipeline associated with this job is 25647. All
    of the processes in a single pipeline are members of the same job.
    <b>Bash</b> uses the <i>job</i> abstraction as the basis for job
  control.</p>
<p class="Pp">To facilitate the implementation of the user interface to job
    control, the operating system maintains the notion of a <i>current
    terminal</i> <i>process group ID</i>. Members of this process group
    (processes whose process group ID is equal to the current terminal process
    group ID) receive keyboard-generated signals such as <b>SIGINT</b>. These
    processes are said to be in the <i>foreground</i>. <i>Background</i>
    processes are those whose process group ID differs from the terminal's; such
    processes are immune to keyboard-generated signals. Only foreground
    processes are allowed to read from or write to the terminal. Background
    processes which attempt to read from (write to) the terminal are sent a
    <small><b>SIGTTIN (SIGTTOU)</b></small> signal by the terminal driver,
    which, unless caught, suspends the process.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the operating system on which <b>bash</b> is running supports
    job control, <b>bash</b> contains facilities to use it. Typing the
    <i>suspend</i> character (typically <b>^Z</b>, Control-Z) while a process is
    running causes that process to be stopped and returns control to
    <b>bash</b>. Typing the <i>delayed suspend</i> character (typically
    <b>^Y</b>, Control-Y) causes the process to be stopped when it attempts to
    read input from the terminal, and control to be returned to <b>bash</b>. The
    user may then manipulate the state of this job, using the <b>bg</b> command
    to continue it in the background, the <b>fg</b> command to continue it in
    the foreground, or the <b>kill</b> command to kill it. A <b>^Z</b> takes
    effect immediately, and has the additional side effect of causing pending
    output and typeahead to be discarded.</p>
<p class="Pp">There are a number of ways to refer to a job in the shell. The
    character <b>%</b> introduces a job name. Job number <i>n</i> may be
    referred to as <b>%n</b>. A job may also be referred to using a prefix of
    the name used to start it, or using a substring that appears in its command
    line. For example, <b>%ce</b> refers to a stopped <b>ce</b> job. If a prefix
    matches more than one job, <b>bash</b> reports an error. Using <b>%?ce</b>,
    on the other hand, refers to any job containing the string <b>ce</b> in its
    command line. If the substring matches more than one job, <b>bash</b>
    reports an error. The symbols <b>%%</b> and <b>%+</b> refer to the shell's
    notion of the <i>current job</i>, which is the last job stopped while it was
    in the foreground or started in the background. The <i>previous job</i> may
    be referenced using <b>%-</b>. In output pertaining to jobs (e.g., the
    output of the <b>jobs</b> command), the current job is always flagged with a
    <b>+</b>, and the previous job with a <b>-</b>. A single % (with no
    accompanying job specification) also refers to the current job.</p>
<p class="Pp">Simply naming a job can be used to bring it into the foreground:
    <b>%1</b> is a synonym for <b>``fg %1''</b>, bringing job 1 from the
    background into the foreground. Similarly, <b>``%1 &amp;''</b> resumes job 1
    in the background, equivalent to <b>``bg %1''</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The shell learns immediately whenever a job changes state.
    Normally, <b>bash</b> waits until it is about to print a prompt before
    reporting changes in a job's status so as to not interrupt any other output.
    If the <b>-b</b> option to the <b>set</b> builtin command is enabled,
    <b>bash</b> reports such changes immediately. Any trap on
    <small><b>SIGCHLD</b></small> is executed for each child that exits.</p>
<p class="Pp">If an attempt to exit <b>bash</b> is made while jobs are stopped,
    the shell prints a warning message. The <b>jobs</b> command may then be used
    to inspect their status. If a second attempt to exit is made without an
    intervening command, the shell does not print another warning, and the
    stopped jobs are terminated.</p>

<p class="Pp">The command number and the history number are usually different:
    the history number of a command is its position in the history list, which

    position in the sequence of commands executed during the current shell

    subject to the value of the <b>promptvars</b> shell option (see the

<h1 class="Sh" id="READLINE"><a class="permalink" href="#READLINE">READLINE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">This is the library that handles reading input when using an
    interactive shell, unless the <b>--noediting</b> option is given at shell
    invocation. By default, the line editing commands are similar to those of
    emacs. A vi-style line editing interface is also available. To turn off line
    editing after the shell is running, use the <b>+o emacs</b> or <b>+o vi</b>
    options to the <b>set</b> builtin (see <small><b>SHELL BUILTIN
    COMMANDS</b></small> below).</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Readline_Notation"><a class="permalink" href="#Readline_Notation">Readline
  Notation</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">In this section, the emacs-style notation is used to denote
    keystrokes. Control keys are denoted by C-<i>key</i>, e.g., C-n means
    Control-N. Similarly, <i>meta</i> keys are denoted by M-<i>key</i>, so M-x
    means Meta-X. (On keyboards without a <i>meta</i> key, M-<i>x</i> means ESC
    <i>x</i>, i.e., press the Escape key then the <i>x</i> key. This makes ESC
    the <i>meta prefix</i>. The combination M-C-<i>x</i> means
    ESC-Control-<i>x</i>, or press the Escape key then hold the Control key
    while pressing the <i>x</i> key.)</p>
<p class="Pp">Readline commands may be given numeric <i>arguments</i>, which
    normally act as a repeat count. Sometimes, however, it is the sign of the
    argument that is significant. Passing a negative argument to a command that
    acts in the forward direction (e.g., <b>kill-line</b>) causes that command
    to act in a backward direction. Commands whose behavior with arguments
    deviates from this are noted below.</p>
<p class="Pp">When a command is described as <i>killing</i> text, the text
    deleted is saved for possible future retrieval (<i>yanking</i>). The killed
    text is saved in a <i>kill ring</i>. Consecutive kills cause the text to be
    accumulated into one unit, which can be yanked all at once. Commands which
    do not kill text separate the chunks of text on the kill ring.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Readline_Initialization"><a class="permalink" href="#Readline_Initialization">Readline
  Initialization</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Readline is customized by putting commands in an initialization
    file (the <i>inputrc</i> file). The name of this file is taken from the
    value of the <small><b>INPUTRC</b></small> variable. If that variable is
    unset, the default is <i>~/.inputrc</i>. When a program which uses the
    readline library starts up, the initialization file is read, and the key
    bindings and variables are set. There are only a few basic constructs
    allowed in the readline initialization file. Blank lines are ignored. Lines
    beginning with a <b>#</b> are comments. Lines beginning with a <b>$</b>
    indicate conditional constructs. Other lines denote key bindings and
    variable settings.</p>
<p class="Pp">The default key-bindings may be changed with an <i>inputrc</i>
    file. Other programs that use this library may add their own commands and
    bindings.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, placing</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">M-Control-u: universal-argument</p>
</div>
or
<div class="Bd-indent">C-Meta-u: universal-argument</div>
into the <i>inputrc</i> would make M-C-u execute the readline command
  <i>universal-argument</i>.
<p class="Pp">The following symbolic character names are recognized:
    <i>RUBOUT</i>, <i>DEL</i>, <i>ESC</i>, <i>LFD</i>, <i>NEWLINE</i>,
    <i>RET</i>, <i>RETURN</i>, <i>SPC</i>, <i>SPACE</i>, and <i>TAB</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">In addition to command names, readline allows keys to be bound to
    a string that is inserted when the key is pressed (a <i>macro</i>).</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Readline_Key_Bindings"><a class="permalink" href="#Readline_Key_Bindings">Readline
  Key Bindings</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The syntax for controlling key bindings in the <i>inputrc</i> file
    is simple. All that is required is the name of the command or the text of a
    macro and a key sequence to which it should be bound. The name may be
    specified in one of two ways: as a symbolic key name, possibly with
    <i>Meta-</i> or <i>Control-</i> prefixes, or as a key sequence.</p>
<p class="Pp">When using the form <b>keyname</b>:<i>function-name</i> or
    <i>macro</i>, <i>keyname</i> is the name of a key spelled out in English.
    For example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Control-u: universal-argument
<br/>
Meta-Rubout: backward-kill-word
<br/>
Control-o: &quot;&gt; output&quot;</div>
<p class="Pp">In the above example, <i>C-u</i> is bound to the function
    <b>universal-argument</b>, <i>M-DEL</i> is bound to the function
    <b>backward-kill-word</b>, and <i>C-o</i> is bound to run the macro
    expressed on the right hand side (that is, to insert the text ``&gt;
    output'' into the line).</p>
<p class="Pp">In the second form, <b>&quot;keyseq&quot;</b>:<i>function-name</i>
    or <i>macro</i>, <b>keyseq</b> differs from <b>keyname</b> above in that
    strings denoting an entire key sequence may be specified by placing the
    sequence within double quotes. Some GNU Emacs style key escapes can be used,
    as in the following example, but the symbolic character names are not
    recognized.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&quot;\C-u&quot;: universal-argument
<br/>
&quot;\C-x\C-r&quot;: re-read-init-file
<br/>
&quot;\e[11~&quot;: &quot;Function Key 1&quot;</div>
<p class="Pp">In this example, <i>C-u</i> is again bound to the function
    <b>universal-argument</b>. <i>C-x C-r</i> is bound to the function
    <b>re-read-init-file</b>, and <i>ESC [ 1 1 ~</i> is bound to insert the text
    ``Function Key 1''.</p>
<p class="Pp">The full set of GNU Emacs style escape sequences is</p>

</div>
<p class="Pp">When entering the text of a macro, single or double quotes must be
    used to indicate a macro definition. Unquoted text is assumed to be a

    expanded. Backslash will quote any other character in the macro text,
    including &quot; and '.</p>

      readline is in emacs or vi mode. This may be used in conjunction with the
      <b>set keymap</b> command, for instance, to set bindings in the
      <i>emacs-standard</i> and <i>emacs-ctlx</i> keymaps only if readline is
      starting out in emacs mode.</dd>
  <dt id="term"><a class="permalink" href="#term"><b>term</b></a></dt>
  <dd>The <b>term=</b> form may be used to include terminal-specific key
      bindings, perhaps to bind the key sequences output by the terminal's
      function keys. The word on the right side of the <b>=</b> is tested
      against the both full name of the terminal and the portion of the terminal
      name before the first <b>-</b>. This allows <i>sun</i> to match both
      <i>sun</i> and <i>sun-cmd</i>, for instance.</dd>
  <dt id="application"><a class="permalink" href="#application"><b>application</b></a></dt>
  <dd>The <b>application</b> construct is used to include application-specific
      settings. Each program using the readline library sets the <i>application
      name</i>, and an initialization file can test for a particular value. This
      could be used to bind key sequences to functions useful for a specific
      program. For instance, the following command adds a key sequence that
      quotes the current or previous word in Bash:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre><b>$if</b> Bash
# Quote the current or previous word
&quot;\C-xq&quot;: &quot;\eb\&quot;\ef\&quot;&quot;
<b>$endif</b></pre>
</div>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>$endif</b></dt>
  <dd>This command, as seen in the previous example, terminates an <b>$if</b>
      command.</dd>
  <dt><b>$else</b></dt>
  <dd>Commands in this branch of the <b>$if</b> directive are executed if the
      test fails.</dd>
  <dt><b>$include</b></dt>
  <dd>This directive takes a single filename as an argument and reads commands
      and bindings from that file. For example, the following directive would
      read <i>/etc/inputrc</i>:
    <p class="Pp"></p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Searching"><a class="permalink" href="#Searching">Searching</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Readline provides commands for searching through the command
    history (see <small><b>HISTORY</b></small> below) for lines containing a
    specified string. There are two search modes: <i>incremental</i> and
    <i>non-incremental</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Incremental searches begin before the user has finished typing the
    search string. As each character of the search string is typed, readline
    displays the next entry from the history matching the string typed so far.
    An incremental search requires only as many characters as needed to find the
    desired history entry. The characters present in the value of the
    <b>isearch-terminators</b> variable are used to terminate an incremental
    search. If that variable has not been assigned a value the Escape and
    Control-J characters will terminate an incremental search. Control-G will
    abort an incremental search and restore the original line. When the search
    is terminated, the history entry containing the search string becomes the
    current line.</p>
<p class="Pp">To find other matching entries in the history list, type Control-S
    or Control-R as appropriate. This will search backward or forward in the
    history for the next entry matching the search string typed so far. Any
    other key sequence bound to a readline command will terminate the search and
    execute that command. For instance, a <i>newline</i> will terminate the
    search and accept the line, thereby executing the command from the history
    list.</p>
<p class="Pp">Readline remembers the last incremental search string. If two
    Control-Rs are typed without any intervening characters defining a new
    search string, any remembered search string is used.</p>
<p class="Pp">Non-incremental searches read the entire search string before
    starting to search for matching history lines. The search string may be
    typed by the user or be part of the contents of the current line.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Programmable_Completion"><a class="permalink" href="#Programmable_Completion">Programmable
  Completion</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">When word completion is attempted for an argument to a command for
    which a completion specification (a <i>compspec</i>) has been defined using
    the <b>complete</b> builtin (see <small><b>SHELL BUILTIN
    COMMANDS</b></small> below), the programmable completion facilities are
    invoked.</p>
<p class="Pp">First, the command name is identified. If a compspec has been
    defined for that command, the compspec is used to generate the list of
    possible completions for the word. If the command word is a full pathname, a
    compspec for the full pathname is searched for first. If no compspec is
    found for the full pathname, an attempt is made to find a compspec for the
    portion following the final slash.</p>
<p class="Pp">Once a compspec has been found, it is used to generate the list of
    matching words. If a compspec is not found, the default <b>bash</b>
    completion as described above under <b>Completing</b> is performed.</p>
<p class="Pp">First, the actions specified by the compspec are used. Only
    matches which are prefixed by the word being completed are returned. When
    the <b>-f</b> or <b>-d</b> option is used for filename or directory name
    completion, the shell variable <small><b>FIGNORE</b></small> is used to
    filter the matches.</p>
<p class="Pp">Any completions specified by a filename expansion pattern to the
    <b>-G</b> option are generated next. The words generated by the pattern need
    not match the word being completed. The <small><b>GLOBIGNORE</b></small>
    shell variable is not used to filter the matches, but the
    <small><b>FIGNORE</b></small> variable is used.</p>
<p class="Pp">Next, the string specified as the argument to the <b>-W</b> option
    is considered. The string is first split using the characters in the
    <small><b>IFS</b></small> special variable as delimiters. Shell quoting is
    honored. Each word is then expanded using brace expansion, tilde expansion,
    parameter and variable expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic
    expansion, as described above under <b>EXPANSION</b>. The results are split
    using the rules described above under <b>Word Splitting</b>. The results of
    the expansion are prefix-matched against the word being completed, and the
    matching words become the possible completions.</p>
<p class="Pp">After these matches have been generated, any shell function or
    command specified with the <b>-F</b> and <b>-C</b> options is invoked. When
    the command or function is invoked, the <small><b>COMP_LINE</b></small> and
    <small><b>COMP_POINT</b></small> variables are assigned values as described
    above under <b>Shell Variables</b>. If a shell function is being invoked,
    the <small><b>COMP_WORDS</b></small> and <small><b>COMP_CWORD</b></small>
    variables are also set. When the function or command is invoked, the first
    argument is the name of the command whose arguments are being completed, the
    second argument is the word being completed, and the third argument is the
    word preceding the word being completed on the current command line. No
    filtering of the generated completions against the word being completed is
    performed; the function or command has complete freedom in generating the
    matches.</p>
<p class="Pp">Any function specified with <b>-F</b> is invoked first. The
    function may use any of the shell facilities, including the <b>compgen</b>
    builtin described below, to generate the matches. It must put the possible
    completions in the <small><b>COMPREPLY</b></small> array variable.</p>
<p class="Pp">Next, any command specified with the <b>-C</b> option is invoked
    in an environment equivalent to command substitution. It should print a list
    of completions, one per line, to the standard output. Backslash may be used
    to escape a newline, if necessary.</p>
<p class="Pp">After all of the possible completions are generated, any filter
    specified with the <b>-X</b> option is applied to the list. The filter is a
    pattern as used for pathname expansion; a <b>&amp;</b> in the pattern is
    replaced with the text of the word being completed. A literal <b>&amp;</b>
    may be escaped with a backslash; the backslash is removed before attempting
    a match. Any completion that matches the pattern will be removed from the
    list. A leading <b>!</b> negates the pattern; in this case any completion
    not matching the pattern will be removed.</p>
<p class="Pp">Finally, any prefix and suffix specified with the <b>-P</b> and
    <b>-S</b> options are added to each member of the completion list, and the
    result is returned to the readline completion code as the list of possible
    completions.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the previously-applied actions do not generate any matches, and
    the <b>-o dirnames</b> option was supplied to <b>complete</b> when the
    compspec was defined, directory name completion is attempted.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the <b>-o plusdirs</b> option was supplied to <b>complete</b>
    when the compspec was defined, directory name completion is attempted and
    any matches are added to the results of the other actions.</p>
<p class="Pp">By default, if a compspec is found, whatever it generates is
    returned to the completion code as the full set of possible completions. The
    default <b>bash</b> completions are not attempted, and the readline default
    of filename completion is disabled. If the <b>-o bashdefault</b> option was
    supplied to <b>complete</b> when the compspec was defined, the <b>bash</b>
    default completions are attempted if the compspec generates no matches. If
    the <b>-o default</b> option was supplied to <b>complete</b> when the
    compspec was defined, readline's default completion will be performed if the
    compspec (and, if attempted, the default <b>bash</b> completions) generate
    no matches.</p>
<p class="Pp">When a compspec indicates that directory name completion is
    desired, the programmable completion functions force readline to append a
    slash to completed names which are symbolic links to directories, subject to
    the value of the <b>mark-directories</b> readline variable, regardless of
    the setting of the <b>mark-symlinked-directories</b> readline variable.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="HISTORY"><a class="permalink" href="#HISTORY">HISTORY</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">When the <b>-o history</b> option to the <b>set</b> builtin is
    enabled, the shell provides access to the <i>command history</i>, the list
    of commands previously typed. The value of the <b>HISTSIZE</b> variable is
    used as the number of commands to save in a history list. The text of the
    last <small><b>HISTSIZE</b></small> commands (default 500) is saved. The
    shell stores each command in the history list prior to parameter and
    variable expansion (see <small><b>EXPANSION</b></small> above) but after
    history expansion is performed, subject to the values of the shell variables
    <small><b>HISTIGNORE</b></small> and <b>HISTCONTROL</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">On startup, the history is initialized from the file named by the
    variable <small><b>HISTFILE</b></small> (default <i>~/.bash_history</i>).
    The file named by the value of <small><b>HISTFILE</b></small> is truncated,
    if necessary, to contain no more than the number of lines specified by the
    value of <b>HISTFILESIZE</b>. When an interactive shell exits, the last
    <small><b>$HISTSIZE</b></small> lines are copied from the history list to
    <b>$HISTFILE</b>. If the <b>histappend</b> shell option is enabled (see the
    description of <b>shopt</b> under <small><b>SHELL BUILTIN
    COMMANDS</b></small> below), the lines are appended to the history file,
    otherwise the history file is overwritten. If <small><b>HISTFILE</b></small>
    is unset, or if the history file is unwritable, the history is not saved.
    After saving the history, the history file is truncated to contain no more
    than <small><b>HISTFILESIZE</b></small> lines. If
    <small><b>HISTFILESIZE</b></small> is not set, no truncation is
  performed.</p>
<p class="Pp">The builtin command <b>fc</b> (see <small><b>SHELL BUILTIN
    COMMANDS</b></small> below) may be used to list or edit and re-execute a
    portion of the history list. The <b>history</b> builtin may be used to
    display or modify the history list and manipulate the history file. When
    using command-line editing, search commands are available in each editing
    mode that provide access to the history list.</p>
<p class="Pp">The shell allows control over which commands are saved on the
    history list. The <small><b>HISTCONTROL</b></small> and
    <small><b>HISTIGNORE</b></small> variables may be set to cause the shell to
    save only a subset of the commands entered. The <b>cmdhist</b> shell option,
    if enabled, causes the shell to attempt to save each line of a multi-line
    command in the same history entry, adding semicolons where necessary to
    preserve syntactic correctness. The <b>lithist</b> shell option causes the
    shell to save the command with embedded newlines instead of semicolons. See
    the description of the <b>shopt</b> builtin below under <small><b>SHELL
    BUILTIN COMMANDS</b></small> for information on setting and unsetting shell
    options.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="HISTORY_EXPANSION"><a class="permalink" href="#HISTORY_EXPANSION">HISTORY
  EXPANSION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The shell supports a history expansion feature that is similar to
    the history expansion in <b>csh.</b> This section describes what syntax
    features are available. This feature is enabled by default for interactive
    shells, and can be disabled using the <b>+H</b> option to the <b>set</b>
    builtin command (see <small><b>SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</b></small> below).
    Non-interactive shells do not perform history expansion by default.</p>
<p class="Pp">History expansions introduce words from the history list into the
    input stream, making it easy to repeat commands, insert the arguments to a
    previous command into the current input line, or fix errors in previous
    commands quickly.</p>
<p class="Pp">History expansion is performed immediately after a complete line
    is read, before the shell breaks it into words. It takes place in two parts.
    The first is to determine which line from the history list to use during
    substitution. The second is to select portions of that line for inclusion
    into the current one. The line selected from the history is the
    <i>event</i>, and the portions of that line that are acted upon are
    <i>words</i>. Various <i>modifiers</i> are available to manipulate the
    selected words. The line is broken into words in the same fashion as when
    reading input, so that several <i>metacharacter</i>-separated words
    surrounded by quotes are considered one word. History expansions are
    introduced by the appearance of the history expansion character, which is
    <b>!</b> by default. Only backslash (<b>\</b>) and single quotes can quote
    the history expansion character.</p>
<p class="Pp">Several characters inhibit history expansion if found immediately
    following the history expansion character, even if it is unquoted: space,
    tab, newline, carriage return, and <b>=</b>. If the <b>extglob</b> shell
    option is enabled, <b>(</b> will also inhibit expansion.</p>
<p class="Pp">Several shell options settable with the <b>shopt</b> builtin may
    be used to tailor the behavior of history expansion. If the
    <b>histverify</b> shell option is enabled (see the description of the
    <b>shopt</b> builtin), and <b>readline</b> is being used, history
    substitutions are not immediately passed to the shell parser. Instead, the
    expanded line is reloaded into the <b>readline</b> editing buffer for
    further modification. If <b>readline</b> is being used, and the
    <b>histreedit</b> shell option is enabled, a failed history substitution
    will be reloaded into the <b>readline</b> editing buffer for correction. The
    <b>-p</b> option to the <b>history</b> builtin command may be used to see
    what a history expansion will do before using it. The <b>-s</b> option to
    the <b>history</b> builtin may be used to add commands to the end of the
    history list without actually executing them, so that they are available for
    subsequent recall.</p>
<p class="Pp">The shell allows control of the various characters used by the
    history expansion mechanism (see the description of <b>histchars</b> above
    under <b>Shell Variables</b>).</p>

  BUILTIN COMMANDS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Unless otherwise noted, each builtin command documented in this
    section as accepting options preceded by <b>-</b> accepts <b>--</b> to
    signify the end of the options. For example, the <b>:</b>, <b>true</b>,
    <b>false</b>, and <b>test</b> builtins do not accept options.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>:</b> [<i>arguments</i>]</dt>
  <dd>No effect; the command does nothing beyond expanding <i>arguments</i> and
      performing any specified redirections. A zero exit code is returned.</dd>

  <dd></dd>
  <dt id="source"><a class="permalink" href="#source"><b>source</b>
    <i>filename</i> [<i>arguments</i>]</a></dt>
  <dd>Read and execute commands from <i>filename</i> in the current shell
      environment and return the exit status of the last command executed from
      <i>filename</i>. If <i>filename</i> does not contain a slash, file names
      in <small><b>PATH</b></small> are used to find the directory containing
      <i>filename</i>. The file searched for in <small><b>PATH</b></small> need
      not be executable. When <b>bash</b> is not in <i>posix mode</i>, the
      current directory is searched if no file is found in <b>PATH</b>. If the
      <b>sourcepath</b> option to the <b>shopt</b> builtin command is turned
      off, the <small><b>PATH</b></small> is not searched. If any
      <i>arguments</i> are supplied, they become the positional parameters when
      <i>filename</i> is executed. Otherwise the positional parameters are
      unchanged. The return status is the status of the last command exited
      within the script (0 if no commands are executed), and false if
      <i>filename</i> is not found or cannot be read.</dd>
  <dt><b>alias</b> [<b>-p</b>] [<i>name</i>[=<i>value</i>] ...]</dt>
  <dd><b>Alias</b> with no arguments or with the <b>-p</b> option prints the
      list of aliases in the form <b>alias</b> <i>name</i>=<i>value</i> on
      standard output. When arguments are supplied, an alias is defined for each
      <i>name</i> whose <i>value</i> is given. A trailing space in <i>value</i>
      causes the next word to be checked for alias substitution when the alias
      is expanded. For each <i>name</i> in the argument list for which no
      <i>value</i> is supplied, the name and value of the alias is printed.
      <b>Alias</b> returns true unless a <i>name</i> is given for which no alias
      has been defined.</dd>
  <dt id="bg"><a class="permalink" href="#bg"><b>bg</b> [<i>jobspec</i>

  <dd>Resume each suspended job <i>jobspec</i> in the background, as if it had
      been started with <b>&amp;</b>. If <i>jobspec</i> is not present, the
      shell's notion of the <i>current job</i> is used. <b>bg</b> <i>jobspec</i>
      returns 0 unless run when job control is disabled or, when run with job
      control enabled, any specified <i>jobspec</i> was not found or was started
      without job control.</dd>

  <dt><b>builtin</b> <i>shell-builtin</i> [<i>arguments</i>]</dt>
  <dd>Execute the specified shell builtin, passing it <i>arguments</i>, and
      return its exit status. This is useful when defining a function whose name
      is the same as a shell builtin, retaining the functionality of the builtin
      within the function. The <b>cd</b> builtin is commonly redefined this way.
      The return status is false if <i>shell-builtin</i> is not a shell builtin
      command.</dd>
  <dt id="cd"><a class="permalink" href="#cd"><b>cd</b> [<b>-L|-P</b>]
    [<i>dir</i>]</a></dt>
  <dd>Change the current directory to <i>dir</i>. The variable
      <small><b>HOME</b></small> is the default <i>dir</i>. The variable
      <small><b>CDPATH</b></small> defines the search path for the directory
      containing <i>dir</i>. Alternative directory names in
      <small><b>CDPATH</b></small> are separated by a colon (:). A null
      directory name in <small><b>CDPATH</b></small> is the same as the current
      directory, i.e., ``<b>.</b>''. If <i>dir</i> begins with a slash (/), then
      <small><b>CDPATH</b></small> is not used. The <b>-P</b> option says to use
      the physical directory structure instead of following symbolic links (see
      also the <b>-P</b> option to the <b>set</b> builtin command); the
      <b>-L</b> option forces symbolic links to be followed. An argument of
      <b>-</b> is equivalent to <b>$OLDPWD</b>. If a non-empty directory name
      from <b>CDPATH</b> is used, or if <b>-</b> is the first argument, and the
      directory change is successful, the absolute pathname of the new working
      directory is written to the standard output. The return value is true if
      the directory was successfully changed; false otherwise.</dd>
  <dt id="caller"><a class="permalink" href="#caller"><b>caller</b>
    [<i>expr</i>]</a></dt>
  <dd>Returns the context of any active subroutine call (a shell function or a
      script executed with the <b>.</b> or <b>source</b> builtins. Without
      <i>expr</i>, <b>caller</b> displays the line number and source filename of
      the current subroutine call. If a non-negative integer is supplied as
      <i>expr</i>, <b>caller</b> displays the line number, subroutine name, and
      source file corresponding to that position in the current execution call
      stack. This extra information may be used, for example, to print a stack
      trace. The current frame is frame 0. The return value is 0 unless the
      shell is not executing a subroutine call or <i>expr</i> does not
      correspond to a valid position in the call stack.</dd>
  <dt><b>command</b> [<b>-pVv</b>] <i>command</i> [<i>arg</i> ...]</dt>
  <dd>Run <i>command</i> with <i>args</i> suppressing the normal shell function
      lookup. Only builtin commands or commands found in the
      <small><b>PATH</b></small> are executed. If the <b>-p</b> option is given,
      the search for <i>command</i> is performed using a default value for
      <b>PATH</b> that is guaranteed to find all of the standard utilities. If
      either the <b>-V</b> or <b>-v</b> option is supplied, a description of
      <i>command</i> is printed. The <b>-v</b> option causes a single word
      indicating the command or file name used to invoke <i>command</i> to be
      displayed; the <b>-V</b> option produces a more verbose description. If
      the <b>-V</b> or <b>-v</b> option is supplied, the exit status is 0 if
      <i>command</i> was found, and 1 if not. If neither option is supplied and
      an error occurred or <i>command</i> cannot be found, the exit status is
      127. Otherwise, the exit status of the <b>command</b> builtin is the exit
      status of <i>command</i>.</dd>
  <dt id="compgen"><a class="permalink" href="#compgen"><b>compgen</b>
    [<i>option</i>] [<i>word</i>]</a></dt>
  <dd>Generate possible completion matches for <i>word</i> according to the
      <i>option</i>s, which may be any option accepted by the <b>complete</b>
      builtin with the exception of <b>-p</b> and <b>-r</b>, and write the
      matches to the standard output. When using the <b>-F</b> or <b>-C</b>
      options, the various shell variables set by the programmable completion
      facilities, while available, will not have useful values.
    <p class="Pp">The matches will be generated in the same way as if the
        programmable completion code had generated them directly from a
        completion specification with the same flags. If <i>word</i> is
        specified, only those completions matching <i>word</i> will be
        displayed.</p>

      specifications.

      disk command which has the same name as a shell builtin to be executed
      without specifying a full pathname, even though the shell normally
      searches for builtins before disk commands. If <b>-n</b> is used, each
      <i>name</i> is disabled; otherwise, <i>names</i> are enabled. For example,
      to use the <b>test</b> binary found via the <small><b>PATH</b></small>
      instead of the shell builtin version, run ``enable -n test''. The
      <b>-f</b> option means to load the new builtin command <i>name</i> from
      shared object <i>filename</i>, on systems that support dynamic loading.
      The <b>-d</b> option will delete a builtin previously loaded with
      <b>-f</b>. If no <i>name</i> arguments are given, or if the <b>-p</b>
      option is supplied, a list of shell builtins is printed. With no other
      option arguments, the list consists of all enabled shell builtins. If
      <b>-n</b> is supplied, only disabled builtins are printed. If <b>-a</b> is
      supplied, the list printed includes all builtins, with an indication of
      whether or not each is enabled. If <b>-s</b> is supplied, the output is

      An interactive shell returns failure if the file cannot be executed. If

  <dd>Fix Command. In the first form, a range of commands from <i>first</i> to
      <i>last</i> is selected from the history list. <i>First</i> and
      <i>last</i> may be specified as a string (to locate the last command
      beginning with that string) or as a number (an index into the history
      list, where a negative number is used as an offset from the current
      command number). If <i>last</i> is not specified it is set to the current
      command for listing (so that ``fc -l -10'' prints the last 10 commands)
      and to <i>first</i> otherwise. If <i>first</i> is not specified it is set
      to the previous command for editing and -16 for listing.
    <p class="Pp">The <b>-n</b> option suppresses the command numbers when
        listing. The <b>-r</b> option reverses the order of the commands. If the
        <b>-l</b> option is given, the commands are listed on standard output.
        Otherwise, the editor given by <i>ename</i> is invoked on a file
        containing those commands. If <i>ename</i> is not given, the value of
        the <small><b>FCEDIT</b></small> variable is used, and the value of
        <small><b>EDITOR</b></small> if <small><b>FCEDIT</b></small> is not set.
        If neither variable is set, <i>vi</i> is used. When editing is complete,

    <p class="Pp">In the second form, <i>command</i> is re-executed after each
        instance of <i>pat</i> is replaced by <i>rep</i>. A useful alias to use
        with this is ``r=&quot;fc -s&quot;'', so that typing ``r cc'' runs the
        last command beginning with ``cc'' and typing ``r'' re-executes the last

    <p class="Pp">If the first form is used, the return value is 0 unless an

        return value is the value of the last command executed or failure if an
        error occurs with the temporary file of commands. If the second form is
        used, the return status is that of the command re-executed, unless

    <i>optstring</i> <i>name</i> [<i>args</i>]</a></dt>
  <dd><b>getopts</b> is used by shell procedures to parse positional parameters.
      <i>optstring</i> contains the option characters to be recognized; if a
      character is followed by a colon, the option is expected to have an
      argument, which should be separated from it by white space. The colon and
      question mark characters may not be used as option characters. Each time
      it is invoked, <b>getopts</b> places the next option in the shell variable
      <i>name</i>, initializing <i>name</i> if it does not exist, and the index
      of the next argument to be processed into the variable <b>OPTIND</b>.
      <small><b>OPTIND</b></small> is initialized to 1 each time the shell or a
      shell script is invoked. When an option requires an argument,
      <b>getopts</b> places that argument into the variable <b>OPTARG</b>. The
      shell does not reset <small><b>OPTIND</b></small> automatically; it must
      be manually reset between multiple calls to <b>getopts</b> within the same
      shell invocation if a new set of parameters is to be used.
    <p class="Pp">When the end of options is encountered, <b>getopts</b> exits
        with a return value greater than zero. <b>OPTIND</b> is set to the index
        of the first non-option argument, and <b>name</b> is set to ?.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><b>getopts</b> normally parses the positional parameters, but
        if more arguments are given in <i>args</i>, <b>getopts</b> parses those
        instead.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><b>getopts</b> can report errors in two ways. If the first
        character of <i>optstring</i> is a colon, <i>silent</i> error reporting
        is used. In normal operation diagnostic messages are printed when
        invalid options or missing option arguments are encountered. If the
        variable <small><b>OPTERR</b></small> is set to 0, no error messages
        will be displayed, even if the first character of <i>optstring</i> is
        not a colon.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If an invalid option is seen, <b>getopts</b> places ? into
        <i>name</i> and, if not silent, prints an error message and unsets
        <b>OPTARG</b>. If <b>getopts</b> is silent, the option character found
        is placed in <small><b>OPTARG</b></small> and no diagnostic message is
        printed.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If a required argument is not found, and <b>getopts</b> is not
        silent, a question mark (<b>?</b>) is placed in <i>name</i>,
        <small><b>OPTARG</b></small> is unset, and a diagnostic message is
        printed. If <b>getopts</b> is silent, then a colon (<b>:</b>) is placed
        in <i>name</i> and <small><b>OPTARG</b></small> is set to the option
        character found.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><b>getopts</b> returns true if an option, specified or
        unspecified, is found. It returns false if the end of options is
        encountered or an error occurs.</p>

      option is supplied, no path search is performed, and <i>filename</i> is
      used as the full file name of the command. The <b>-r</b> option causes the

      original disposition (the value it had upon entrance to the shell). If
      <i>arg</i> is the null string the signal specified by each <i>sigspec</i>
      is ignored by the shell and by the commands it invokes. If <i>arg</i> is
      not present and <b>-p</b> has been supplied, then the trap commands
      associated with each <i>sigspec</i> are displayed. If no arguments are
      supplied or if only <b>-p</b> is given, <b>trap</b> prints the list of
      commands associated with each signal. The <b>-l</b> option causes the
      shell to print a list of signal names and their corresponding numbers.
      Each <i>sigspec</i> is either a signal name defined in
      &lt;<i>signal.h</i>&gt;, or a signal number. Signal names are case
      insensitive and the SIG prefix is optional. If a <i>sigspec</i> is
      <small><b>EXIT</b></small> (0) the command <i>arg</i> is executed on exit
      from the shell. If a <i>sigspec</i> is <b>DEBUG</b>, the command
      <i>arg</i> is executed before every <i>simple command</i>, <i>for</i>
      command, <i>case</i> command, <i>select</i> command, every arithmetic
      <i>for</i> command, and before the first command executes in a shell
      function (see <small><b>SHELL GRAMMAR</b></small> above). Refer to the
      description of the <b>extdebug</b> option to the <b>shopt</b> builtin for
      details of its effect on the <b>DEBUG</b> trap. If a <i>sigspec</i> is
      <b>ERR</b>, the command <i>arg</i> is executed whenever a simple command
      has a non-zero exit status, subject to the following conditions. The
      <small><b>ERR</b></small> trap is not executed if the failed command is
      part of the command list immediately following a <b>while</b> or
      <b>until</b> keyword, part of the test in an <i>if</i> statement, part of
      a <b>&amp;&amp;</b> or <b>&#x23AA;&#x23AA;</b> list, or if the command's
      return value is being inverted via <b>!</b>. These are the same conditions
      obeyed by the <b>errexit</b> option. If a <i>sigspec</i> is <b>RETURN</b>,
      the command <i>arg</i> is executed each time a shell function or a script
      executed with the <b>.</b> or <b>source</b> builtins finishes executing.
      Signals ignored upon entry to the shell cannot be trapped or reset.
      Trapped signals that are not being ignored are reset to their original

      <i>function</i>, <i>builtin</i>, or <i>file</i> if <i>name</i> is an

      If the <i>name</i> is not found, then nothing is printed, and an exit
      status of false is returned. If the <b>-p</b> option is used, <b>type</b>
      either returns the name of the disk file that would be executed if
      <i>name</i> were specified as a command name, or nothing if ``type -t
      name'' would not return <i>file</i>. The <b>-P</b> option forces a
      <small><b>PATH</b></small> search for each <i>name</i>, even if ``type -t
      name'' would not return <i>file</i>. If a command is hashed, <b>-p</b> and

      includes aliases and functions, if and only if the <b>-p</b> option is not

  <dd>The user file-creation mask is set to <i>mode</i>. If <i>mode</i> begins

      form; the default output is an octal number. If the <b>-p</b> option is
      supplied, and <i>mode</i> is omitted, the output is in a form that may be

  SHELL</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">If <b>bash</b> is started with the name <b>rbash</b>, or the
    <b>-r</b> option is supplied at invocation, the shell becomes restricted. A
    restricted shell is used to set up an environment more controlled than the
    standard shell. It behaves identically to <b>bash</b> with the exception
    that the following are disallowed or not performed:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>changing directories with <b>cd</b></li>
  <li>setting or unsetting the values of <b>SHELL</b>, <b>PATH</b>, <b>ENV</b>,
      or <b>BASH_ENV</b></li>
  <li>specifying command names containing <b>/</b></li>
  <li>specifying a file name containing a <b>/</b> as an argument to the
      <b>.</b> builtin command</li>
  <li>Specifying a filename containing a slash as an argument to the <b>-p</b>
      option to the <b>hash</b> builtin command</li>
  <li>importing function definitions from the shell environment at startup</li>
  <li>parsing the value of <b>SHELLOPTS</b> from the shell environment at
      startup</li>
  <li>redirecting output using the &gt;, &gt;|, &lt;&gt;, &gt;&amp;, &amp;&gt;,
      and &gt;&gt; redirection operators</li>
  <li>using the <b>exec</b> builtin command to replace the shell with another
      command</li>
  <li>adding or deleting builtin commands with the <b>-f</b> and <b>-d</b>
      options to the <b>enable</b> builtin command</li>
  <li>Using the <b>enable</b> builtin command to enable disabled shell
    builtins</li>
  <li>specifying the <b>-p</b> option to the <b>command</b> builtin command</li>
  <li>turning off restricted mode with <b>set +r</b> or <b>set +o
      restricted</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">These restrictions are enforced after any startup files are
  read.</p>
<p class="Pp">When a command that is found to be a shell script is executed (see
    <small><b>COMMAND EXECUTION</b></small> above), <b>rbash</b> turns off any
    restrictions in the shell spawned to execute the script.</p>

<p class="Pp">Once you have determined that a bug actually exists, use the

    encouraged to mail that as well! Suggestions and `philosophical' bug reports
    may be mailed to <i>bug-bash@gnu.org</i> or posted to the Usenet newsgroup

<h1 class="Sh" id="BUGS"><a class="permalink" href="#BUGS">BUGS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">It's too big and too slow.</p>
<p class="Pp">There are some subtle differences between <b>bash</b> and
    traditional versions of <b>sh</b>, mostly because of the
    <small><b>POSIX</b></small> specification.</p>
<p class="Pp">Aliases are confusing in some uses.</p>
<p class="Pp">Shell builtin commands and functions are not
    stoppable/restartable.</p>
<p class="Pp">Compound commands and command sequences of the form `a ; b ; c'
    are not handled gracefully when process suspension is attempted. When a
    process is stopped, the shell immediately executes the next command in the
    sequence. It suffices to place the sequence of commands between parentheses
    to force it into a subshell, which may be stopped as a unit.</p>
<p class="Pp">Commands inside of <b>$(</b>...<b>)</b> command substitution are
    not parsed until substitution is attempted. This will delay error reporting
    until some time after the command is entered. For example, unmatched
    parentheses, even inside shell comments, will result in error messages while
    the construct is being read.</p>
<p class="Pp">Array variables may not (yet) be exported.</p>
