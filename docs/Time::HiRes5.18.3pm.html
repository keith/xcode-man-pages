The <span class="Li">&quot;Time::HiRes&quot;</span> module implements a Perl
  interface to the <span class="Li">&quot;usleep&quot;</span>,
  <span class="Li">&quot;nanosleep&quot;</span>,
  <span class="Li">&quot;ualarm&quot;</span>,
  <span class="Li">&quot;gettimeofday&quot;</span>, and
  <span class="Li">&quot;setitimer&quot;</span>/<span class="Li">&quot;getitimer&quot;</span>
  system calls, in other words, high resolution time and timers. See the
  &quot;EXAMPLES&quot; section below and the test scripts for usage; see your
  system documentation for the description of the underlying
  <span class="Li">&quot;nanosleep&quot;</span> or
  <span class="Li">&quot;usleep&quot;</span>,
  <span class="Li">&quot;ualarm&quot;</span>,
  <span class="Li">&quot;gettimeofday&quot;</span>, and
  <span class="Li">&quot;setitimer&quot;</span>/<span class="Li">&quot;getitimer&quot;</span>
  calls.
<p class="Pp">If your system lacks
    <span class="Li">&quot;gettimeofday()&quot;</span> or an emulation of it you
    don't get <span class="Li">&quot;gettimeofday()&quot;</span> or the
    one-argument form of <span class="Li">&quot;tv_interval()&quot;</span>. If
    your system lacks all of <span class="Li">&quot;nanosleep()&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;usleep()&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;select()&quot;</span>, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;poll&quot;</span>, you don't get
    <span class="Li">&quot;Time::HiRes::usleep()&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;Time::HiRes::nanosleep()&quot;</span>, or
    <span class="Li">&quot;Time::HiRes::sleep()&quot;</span>. If your system
    lacks both <span class="Li">&quot;ualarm()&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;setitimer()&quot;</span> you don't get
    <span class="Li">&quot;Time::HiRes::ualarm()&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;Time::HiRes::alarm()&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you try to import an unimplemented function in the
    <span class="Li">&quot;use&quot;</span> statement it will fail at compile
    time.</p>
<p class="Pp">If your subsecond sleeping is implemented with
    <span class="Li">&quot;nanosleep()&quot;</span> instead of
    <span class="Li">&quot;usleep()&quot;</span>, you can mix subsecond sleeping
    with signals since <span class="Li">&quot;nanosleep()&quot;</span> does not
    use signals. This, however, is not portable, and you should first check for
    the truth value of <span class="Li">&amp;Time::HiRes::d_nanosleep</span> to
    see whether you have nanosleep, and then carefully read your
    <span class="Li">&quot;nanosleep()&quot;</span> C API documentation for any
    peculiarities.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you are using <span class="Li">&quot;nanosleep&quot;</span> for
    something else than mixing sleeping with signals, give some thought to
    whether Perl is the tool you should be using for work requiring nanosecond
    accuracies.</p>
<p class="Pp">Remember that unless you are working on a <i>hard realtime</i>
    system, any clocks and timers will be imprecise, especially so if you are
    working in a pre-emptive multiuser system. Understand the difference between
    <i>wallclock time</i> and process time (in UNIX-like systems the sum of
    <i>user</i> and <i>system</i> times). Any attempt to sleep for X seconds
    will most probably end up sleeping <b>more</b> than that, but don't be
    surpised if you end up sleeping slightly <b>less</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following functions can be imported from this module. No
    functions are exported by default.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>gettimeofday ()</dt>
  <dd>In array context returns a two-element array with the seconds and
      microseconds since the epoch. In scalar context returns floating seconds
      like <span class="Li">&quot;Time::HiRes::time()&quot;</span> (see
    below).</dd>
  <dt>usleep ( $useconds )</dt>
  <dd>Sleeps for the number of microseconds (millionths of a second) specified.
      Returns the number of microseconds actually slept. Can sleep for more than
      one second, unlike the <span class="Li">&quot;usleep&quot;</span> system
      call. Can also sleep for zero seconds, which often works like a <i>thread
      yield</i>. See also
      <span class="Li">&quot;Time::HiRes::usleep()&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;Time::HiRes::sleep()&quot;</span>, and
      <span class="Li">&quot;Time::HiRes::clock_nanosleep()&quot;</span>.
    <p class="Pp">Do not expect <i>usleep()</i> to be exact down to one
        microsecond.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>nanosleep ( $nanoseconds )</dt>
  <dd>Sleeps for the number of nanoseconds (1e9ths of a second) specified.
      Returns the number of nanoseconds actually slept (accurate only to
      microseconds, the nearest thousand of them). Can sleep for more than one
      second. Can also sleep for zero seconds, which often works like a
      <i>thread yield</i>. See also
      <span class="Li">&quot;Time::HiRes::sleep()&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;Time::HiRes::usleep()&quot;</span>, and
      <span class="Li">&quot;Time::HiRes::clock_nanosleep()&quot;</span>.
    <p class="Pp">Do not expect <i>nanosleep()</i> to be exact down to one
        nanosecond. Getting even accuracy of one thousand nanoseconds is
      good.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>ualarm ( $useconds [, $interval_useconds ] )</dt>
  <dd>Issues a <span class="Li">&quot;ualarm&quot;</span> call; the
      <span class="Li">$interval_useconds</span> is optional and will be zero if
      unspecified, resulting in <span class="Li">&quot;alarm&quot;</span>-like
      behaviour.
    <p class="Pp">Returns the remaining time in the alarm in microseconds, or
        <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> if an error occurred.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><i>ualarm</i>(0) will cancel an outstanding
      <i>ualarm()</i>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that the interaction between alarms and sleeps is
        unspecified.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>tv_interval</dt>
  <dd>tv_interval ( <span class="Li">$ref_to_gettimeofday</span> [,
      <span class="Li">$ref_to_later_gettimeofday</span>] )
    <p class="Pp">Returns the floating seconds between the two times, which
        should have been returned by
        <span class="Li">&quot;gettimeofday()&quot;</span>. If the second
        argument is omitted, then the current time is used.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>time ()</dt>
  <dd>Returns a floating seconds since the epoch. This function can be imported,
      resulting in a nice drop-in replacement for the
      <span class="Li">&quot;time&quot;</span> provided with core Perl; see the
      &quot;EXAMPLES&quot; below.
    <p class="Pp"><b>NOTE 1</b>: This higher resolution timer can return values
        either less or more than the core
        <span class="Li">&quot;time()&quot;</span>, depending on whether your
        platform rounds the higher resolution timer values up, down, or to the
        nearest second to get the core
        <span class="Li">&quot;time()&quot;</span>, but naturally the difference
        should be never more than half a second. See also
        &quot;clock_getres&quot;, if available in your system.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><b>NOTE 2</b>: Since Sunday, September 9th, 2001 at 01:46:40
        AM GMT, when the <span class="Li">&quot;time()&quot;</span> seconds
        since epoch rolled over to 1_000_000_000, the default floating point
        format of Perl and the seconds since epoch have conspired to produce an
        apparent bug: if you print the value of
        <span class="Li">&quot;Time::HiRes::time()&quot;</span> you seem to be
        getting only five decimals, not six as promised (microseconds). Not to
        worry, the microseconds are there (assuming your platform supports such
        granularity in the first place). What is going on is that the default
        floating point format of Perl only outputs 15 digits. In this case that
        means ten digits before the decimal separator and five after. To see the
        microseconds you can use either
        <span class="Li">&quot;printf&quot;</span>/<span class="Li">&quot;sprintf&quot;</span>
        with <span class="Li">&quot;%.6f&quot;</span>, or the
        <span class="Li">&quot;gettimeofday()&quot;</span> function in list
        context, which will give you the seconds and microseconds as two
        separate values.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>sleep ( $floating_seconds )</dt>
  <dd>Sleeps for the specified amount of seconds. Returns the number of seconds
      actually slept (a floating point value). This function can be imported,
      resulting in a nice drop-in replacement for the
      <span class="Li">&quot;sleep&quot;</span> provided with perl, see the
      &quot;EXAMPLES&quot; below.
    <p class="Pp">Note that the interaction between alarms and sleeps is
        unspecified.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>alarm ( $floating_seconds [, $interval_floating_seconds ] )</dt>
  <dd>The <span class="Li">&quot;SIGALRM&quot;</span> signal is sent after the
      specified number of seconds. Implemented using
      <span class="Li">&quot;setitimer()&quot;</span> if available,
      <span class="Li">&quot;ualarm()&quot;</span> if not. The
      <span class="Li">$interval_floating_seconds</span> argument is optional
      and will be zero if unspecified, resulting in
      <span class="Li">&quot;alarm()&quot;</span>-like behaviour. This function
      can be imported, resulting in a nice drop-in replacement for the
      <span class="Li">&quot;alarm&quot;</span> provided with perl, see the
      &quot;EXAMPLES&quot; below.
    <p class="Pp">Returns the remaining time in the alarm in seconds, or
        <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> if an error occurred.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><b>NOTE 1</b>: With some combinations of operating systems and
        Perl releases <span class="Li">&quot;SIGALRM&quot;</span> restarts
        <span class="Li">&quot;select()&quot;</span>, instead of interrupting
        it. This means that an <span class="Li">&quot;alarm()&quot;</span>
        followed by a <span class="Li">&quot;select()&quot;</span> may together
        take the sum of the times specified for the
        <span class="Li">&quot;alarm()&quot;</span> and the
        <span class="Li">&quot;select()&quot;</span>, not just the time of the
        <span class="Li">&quot;alarm()&quot;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that the interaction between alarms and sleeps is
        unspecified.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>setitimer ( $which, $floating_seconds [, $interval_floating_seconds ]
    )</dt>
  <dd>Start up an interval timer: after a certain time, a signal ($which)
      arrives, and more signals may keep arriving at certain intervals. To
      disable an &quot;itimer&quot;, use
      <span class="Li">$floating_seconds</span> of zero. If the
      <span class="Li">$interval_floating_seconds</span> is set to zero (or
      unspecified), the timer is disabled <b>after</b> the next delivered
      signal.
    <p class="Pp">Use of interval timers may interfere with
        <span class="Li">&quot;alarm()&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;sleep()&quot;</span>, and
        <span class="Li">&quot;usleep()&quot;</span>. In standard-speak the
        &quot;interaction is unspecified&quot;, which means that <i>anything</i>
        may happen: it may work, it may not.</p>
    <p class="Pp">In scalar context, the remaining time in the timer is
        returned.</p>
    <p class="Pp">In list context, both the remaining time and the interval are
        returned.</p>
    <p class="Pp">There are usually three or four interval timers (signals)
        available: the <span class="Li">$which</span> can be
        <span class="Li">&quot;ITIMER_REAL&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;ITIMER_VIRTUAL&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;ITIMER_PROF&quot;</span>, or
        <span class="Li">&quot;ITIMER_REALPROF&quot;</span>. Note that which
        ones are available depends: true UNIX platforms usually have the first
        three, but only Solaris seems to have
        <span class="Li">&quot;ITIMER_REALPROF&quot;</span> (which is used to
        profile multithreaded programs). Win32 unfortunately does not
        haveinterval timers.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;ITIMER_REAL&quot;</span> results in
        <span class="Li">&quot;alarm()&quot;</span>-like behaviour. Time is
        counted in <i>real time</i>; that is, wallclock time.
        <span class="Li">&quot;SIGALRM&quot;</span> is delivered when the timer
        expires.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;ITIMER_VIRTUAL&quot;</span> counts time
        in (process) <i>virtual time</i>; that is, only when the process is
        running. In multiprocessor/user/CPU systems this may be more or less
        than real or wallclock time. (This time is also known as the <i>user
        time</i>.) <span class="Li">&quot;SIGVTALRM&quot;</span> is delivered
        when the timer expires.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;ITIMER_PROF&quot;</span> counts time
        when either the process virtual time or when the operating system is
        running on behalf of the process (such as I/O). (This time is also known
        as the <i>system time</i>.) (The sum of user time and system time is
        known as the <i>CPU time</i>.)
        <span class="Li">&quot;SIGPROF&quot;</span> is delivered when the timer
        expires. <span class="Li">&quot;SIGPROF&quot;</span> can interrupt
        system calls.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The semantics of interval timers for multithreaded programs
        are system-specific, and some systems may support additional interval
        timers. For example, it is unspecified which thread gets the signals.
        See your <span class="Li">&quot;setitimer()&quot;</span>
      documentation.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>getitimer ( $which )</dt>
  <dd>Return the remaining time in the interval timer specified by
      <span class="Li">$which</span>.
    <p class="Pp">In scalar context, the remaining time is returned.</p>
    <p class="Pp">In list context, both the remaining time and the interval are
        returned. The interval is always what you put in using
        <span class="Li">&quot;setitimer()&quot;</span>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>clock_gettime ( $which )</dt>
  <dd>Return as seconds the current value of the POSIX high resolution timer
      specified by <span class="Li">$which</span>. All implementations that
      support POSIX high resolution timers are supposed to support at least the
      <span class="Li">$which</span> value of
      <span class="Li">&quot;CLOCK_REALTIME&quot;</span>, which is supposed to
      return results close to the results of
      <span class="Li">&quot;gettimeofday&quot;</span>, or the number of seconds
      since 00:00:00:00 January 1, 1970 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). Do not assume
      that CLOCK_REALTIME is zero, it might be one, or something else. Another
      potentially useful (but not available everywhere) value is
      <span class="Li">&quot;CLOCK_MONOTONIC&quot;</span>, which guarantees a
      monotonically increasing time value (unlike <i>time()</i> or
      <i>gettimeofday()</i>, which can be adjusted). See your system
      documentation for other possibly supported values.</dd>
  <dt>clock_getres ( $which )</dt>
  <dd>Return as seconds the resolution of the POSIX high resolution timer
      specified by <span class="Li">$which</span>. All implementations that
      support POSIX high resolution timers are supposed to support at least the
      <span class="Li">$which</span> value of
      <span class="Li">&quot;CLOCK_REALTIME&quot;</span>, see
      &quot;clock_gettime&quot;.</dd>
  <dt>clock_nanosleep ( $which, $nanoseconds, $flags = 0)</dt>
  <dd>Sleeps for the number of nanoseconds (1e9ths of a second) specified.
      Returns the number of nanoseconds actually slept. The
      <span class="Li">$which</span> is the &quot;clock id&quot;, as with
      <i>clock_gettime()</i> and <i>clock_getres()</i>. The flags default to
      zero but <span class="Li">&quot;TIMER_ABSTIME&quot;</span> can specified
      (must be exported explicitly) which means that
      <span class="Li">$nanoseconds</span> is not a time interval (as is the
      default) but instead an absolute time. Can sleep for more than one second.
      Can also sleep for zero seconds, which often works like a <i>thread
      yield</i>. See also
      <span class="Li">&quot;Time::HiRes::sleep()&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;Time::HiRes::usleep()&quot;</span>, and
      <span class="Li">&quot;Time::HiRes::nanosleep()&quot;</span>.
    <p class="Pp">Do not expect <i>clock_nanosleep()</i> to be exact down to one
        nanosecond. Getting even accuracy of one thousand nanoseconds is
      good.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><i>clock()</i></dt>
  <dd>Return as seconds the <i>process time</i> (user + system time) spent by
      the process since the first call to <i>clock()</i> (the definition is
      <b>not</b> &quot;since the start of the process&quot;, though if you are
      lucky these times may be quite close to each other, depending on the
      system). What this means is that you probably need to store the result of
      your first call to <i>clock()</i>, and subtract that value from the
      following results of <i>clock()</i>.
    <p class="Pp">The time returned also includes the process times of the
        terminated child processes for which <i>wait()</i> has been executed.
        This value is somewhat like the second value returned by the
        <i>times()</i> of core Perl, but not necessarily identical. Note that
        due to backward compatibility limitations the returned value may wrap
        around at about 2147 seconds or at about 36 minutes.</p>

        value larger than zero means yes. There are unfortunately no easy ways
        to find out whether the filesystem supports such timestamps. UNIX
        filesystems often do; NTFS does; FAT doesn't (FAT timestamp granularity
        is <b>two</b> seconds).</p>
    <p class="Pp">A zero return value of &amp;Time::HiRes::d_hires_stat means

<h1 class="Sh" id="C_API"><a class="permalink" href="#C_API">C API</a></h1>
In addition to the perl API described above, a C API is available for extension
  writers. The following C functions are available in the modglobal hash:
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  name             C prototype
  ---------------  ----------------------
  Time::NVtime     double (*)()
  Time::U2time     void (*)(pTHX_ UV ret[2])
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Both functions return equivalent information (like
    <span class="Li">&quot;gettimeofday&quot;</span>) but with different
    representations. The names <span class="Li">&quot;NVtime&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;U2time&quot;</span> were selected mainly because they
    are operating system independent.
    (<span class="Li">&quot;gettimeofday&quot;</span> is Unix-centric, though
    some platforms like Win32 and VMS have emulations for it.)</p>
<p class="Pp">Here is an example of using
    <span class="Li">&quot;NVtime&quot;</span> from C:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  double (*myNVtime)(); /* Returns -1 on failure. */

  if (!SvIOK(*svp)) croak(&quot;Time::NVtime isn't a function pointer&quot;);

In <i>ualarm()</i> you tried to use number of microseconds or interval (also in
  microseconds) more than 1_000_000 and <i>setitimer()</i> is not available in
  your system to emulate that case.

Something went horribly wrong-- the number of microseconds that cannot become
  negative just became negative. Maybe your compiler is broken?

In some platforms it is not possible to get an alarm with subsecond resolution

Notice that the core <span class="Li">&quot;time()&quot;</span> maybe rounding
  rather than truncating. What this means is that the core
  <span class="Li">&quot;time()&quot;</span> may be reporting the time as one
  second later than <span class="Li">&quot;gettimeofday()&quot;</span> and
  <span class="Li">&quot;Time::HiRes::time()&quot;</span>.
<p class="Pp">Adjusting the system clock (either manually or by services like
    ntp) may cause problems, especially for long running programs that assume a
    monotonously increasing time (note that all platforms do not adjust time as
    gracefully as UNIX ntp does). For example in Win32 (and derived platforms
    like Cygwin and MinGW) the <i>Time::HiRes::time()</i> may temporarily drift
    off from the system clock (and the original <i>time()</i>) by up to 0.5
    seconds. Time::HiRes will notice this eventually and recalibrate. Note that
    since Time::HiRes 1.77 the clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC) might help in this
    (in case your system supports CLOCK_MONOTONIC).</p>
<p class="Pp">Some systems have APIs but not implementations: for example QNX
    and Haiku have the interval timer APIs but not the functionality.</p>
