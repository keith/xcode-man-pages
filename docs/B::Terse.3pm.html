<p class="Pp">This module prints the contents of the parse tree, but without as
    much information as CPAN module B::Debug. For comparison,
    <span class="Li">&quot;print &quot;Hello, world.&quot;&quot;</span> produced
    96 lines of output from B::Debug, but only 6 from B::Terse.</p>
<p class="Pp">This module is useful for people who are writing their own back
    end, or who are learning about the Perl internals. It's not useful to the
    average programmer.</p>
<p class="Pp">This version of B::Terse is really just a wrapper that calls
    B::Concise with the <b>-terse</b> option. It is provided for compatibility
    with old scripts (and habits) but using B::Concise directly is now
    recommended instead.</p>
<p class="Pp">For compatibility with the old B::Terse, this module also adds a
    method named <span class="Li">&quot;terse&quot;</span> to B::OP and B::SV
    objects. The B::SV method is largely compatible with the old one, though
    authors of new software might be advised to choose a more user-friendly
    output format. The B::OP <span class="Li">&quot;terse&quot;</span> method,
    however, doesn't work well. Since B::Terse was first written, much more
    information in OPs has migrated to the scratchpad datastructure, but the
    <span class="Li">&quot;terse&quot;</span> interface doesn't have any way of
    getting to the correct pad. As a kludge, the new version will always use the
    pad for the main program, but for OPs in subroutines this will give the
    wrong answer or crash.</p>

<p class="Pp">The original version of B::Terse was written by Malcolm Beattie,

    McCamant, &lt;smcc@MIT.EDU&gt;.</p>
