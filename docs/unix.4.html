The UNIX-domain protocol family is a collection of protocols that provides local
  (on-machine) interprocess communication through the normal
  <a class="Xr">socket(2)</a> mechanisms. The UNIX-domain family supports the
  <code class="Dv">SOCK_STREAM</code> and <code class="Dv">SOCK_DGRAM</code>
  socket types and uses filesystem pathnames for addressing.
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="ADDRESSING"><a class="permalink" href="#ADDRESSING">ADDRESSING</a></h1>
UNIX-domain addresses are variable-length filesystem pathnames of at most 104
  characters. The include file &#x27E8;<span class="Pa">sys/un.h</span>&#x27E9;
  defines this address:
<div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent">
<pre>
struct sockaddr_un {
	u_char	sun_len;
	u_char	sun_family;
	char	sun_path[104];
};
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Binding a name to a UNIX-domain socket with
    <a class="Xr">bind(2)</a> causes a socket file to be created in the
    filesystem. This file is <i class="Em">not</i> removed when the socket is
    closed&#x2014;<a class="Xr">unlink(2)</a> must be used to remove the
  file.</p>
<p class="Pp">The UNIX-domain protocol family does not support broadcast
    addressing or any form of &#x201C;wildcard&#x201D; matching on incoming
    messages. All addresses are absolute- or relative-pathnames of other
    UNIX-domain sockets. Normal filesystem access-control mechanisms are also
    applied when referencing pathnames; e.g., the destination of a
    <a class="Xr">connect(2)</a> or <a class="Xr">sendto(2)</a> must be
    writable.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="PROTOCOLS"><a class="permalink" href="#PROTOCOLS">PROTOCOLS</a></h1>
The UNIX-domain protocol family is comprised of simple transport protocols that
  support the <code class="Dv">SOCK_STREAM</code> and
  <code class="Dv">SOCK_DGRAM</code> abstractions.
  <code class="Dv">SOCK_STREAM</code> sockets also support the communication of
  <span class="Ux">UNIX</span> file descriptors through the use of the
  <var class="Ar">msg_control</var> field in the <var class="Ar">msg</var>
  argument to <a class="Xr">sendmsg(2)</a> and <a class="Xr">recvmsg(2)</a>.
<p class="Pp">Any valid descriptor may be sent in a message. The file
    descriptor(s) to be passed are described using a <var class="Ar">struct
    cmsghdr</var> that is defined in the include file
    &#x27E8;<span class="Pa">sys/socket.h</span>&#x27E9;. The type of the
    message is <code class="Dv">SCM_RIGHTS</code>, and the data portion of the
    messages is an array of integers representing the file descriptors to be
    passed. The number of descriptors being passed is defined by the length
    field of the message; the length field is the sum of the size of the header
    plus the size of the array of file descriptors.</p>
<p class="Pp">The received descriptor is a <i class="Em">duplicate</i> of the
    sender's descriptor, as if it were created with a call to
    <a class="Xr">dup(2)</a>. Per-process descriptor flags, set with
    <a class="Xr">fcntl(2)</a>, are <i class="Em">not</i> passed to a receiver.
    Descriptors that are awaiting delivery, or that are purposely not received,
    are automatically closed by the system when the destination socket is
    closed.</p>
<p class="Pp">The effective credentials (i.e., the user ID and group list) the
    of a peer on a <code class="Dv">SOCK_STREAM</code> socket may be obtained
    using the <code class="Dv">LOCAL_PEERCRED</code> socket option. This may be
    used by a server to obtain and verify the credentials of its client, and
    vice versa by the client to verify the credentials of the server. These will
    arrive in the form of a filled in <var class="Ar">struct xucred</var>
    (defined in <span class="Pa">sys/ucred.h</span>). The credentials presented
    to the server (the <a class="Xr">listen(2)</a> caller) are those of the
    client when it called <a class="Xr">connect(2)</a>; the credentials
    presented to the client (the <a class="Xr">connect(2)</a> caller) are those
    of the server when it called <a class="Xr">listen(2)</a>. This mechanism is
    reliable; there is no way for either party to influence the credentials
    presented to its peer except by calling the appropriate system call (e.g.,
    <a class="Xr">connect(2)</a> or <a class="Xr">listen(2)</a>) under different
    effective credentials.</p>
