Perl's source code, and extensions that want maximum portability, should use the
  above functions instead of those defined in ANSI C's <i>stdio.h</i>. The perl
  headers (in particular &quot;perlio.h&quot;) will
  <span class="Li">&quot;#define&quot;</span> them to the I/O mechanism selected
  at Configure time.
<p class="Pp">The functions are modeled on those in <i>stdio.h</i>, but
    parameter order has been &quot;tidied up a little&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;PerlIO *&quot;</span> takes the place of
    FILE *. Like FILE * it should be treated as opaque (it is probably safe to
    assume it is a pointer to something).</p>
<p class="Pp">There are currently two implementations:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>1. USE_STDIO</dt>
  <dd>All above are #define'd to stdio functions or are trivial wrapper
      functions which call stdio. In this case <i>only</i> PerlIO * is a FILE *.
      This has been the default implementation since the abstraction was
      introduced in perl5.003_02.</dd>
  <dt>2. USE_PERLIO</dt>
  <dd>Introduced just after perl5.7.0, this is a re-implementation of the above
      abstraction which allows perl more control over how IO is done as it
      decouples IO from the way the operating system and C library choose to do
      things. For USE_PERLIO PerlIO * has an extra layer of indirection - it is
      a pointer-to-a-pointer. This allows the PerlIO * to remain with a known
      value while swapping the implementation around underneath <i>at run
      time</i>. In this case all the above are true (but very simple) functions
      which call the underlying implementation.
    <p class="Pp">This is the only implementation for which
        <span class="Li">&quot;PerlIO_apply_layers()&quot;</span> does anything
        &quot;interesting&quot;.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The USE_PERLIO implementation is described in perliol.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Because &quot;perlio.h&quot; is a thin layer (for efficiency) the
    semantics of these functions are somewhat dependent on the underlying
    implementation. Where these variations are understood they are noted
  below.</p>
<p class="Pp">Unless otherwise noted, functions return 0 on success, or a
    negative value (usually <span class="Li">&quot;EOF&quot;</span> which is
    usually -1) and set <span class="Li">&quot;errno&quot;</span> on error.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b></b><b>PerlIO_stdin()</b><b></b>, <b></b><b>PerlIO_stdout()</b><b></b>,
    <b></b><b>PerlIO_stderr()</b><b></b></dt>
  <dd>Use these rather than <span class="Li">&quot;stdin&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;stdout&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;stderr&quot;</span>. They are written to look like
      &quot;function calls&quot; rather than variables because this makes it
      easier to <i>make them</i> function calls if platform cannot export data
      to loaded modules, or if (say) different &quot;threads&quot; might have
      different values.</dd>
  <dt><b>PerlIO_open(path, mode)</b>, <b>PerlIO_fdopen(fd,mode)</b></dt>
  <dd>These correspond to <b>fopen()</b>/<b>fdopen()</b> and the arguments are
      the same. Return <span class="Li">&quot;NULL&quot;</span> and set
      <span class="Li">&quot;errno&quot;</span> if there is an error. There may
      be an implementation limit on the number of open handles, which may be
      lower than the limit on the number of open files -
      <span class="Li">&quot;errno&quot;</span> may not be set when
      <span class="Li">&quot;NULL&quot;</span> is returned if this limit is
      exceeded.</dd>
  <dt><b>PerlIO_reopen(path,mode,f)</b></dt>
  <dd>While this currently exists in both implementations, perl itself does not
      use it. <i>As perl does not use it, it is not well tested.</i>
    <p class="Pp">Perl prefers to <span class="Li">&quot;dup&quot;</span> the
        new low-level descriptor to the descriptor used by the existing PerlIO.
        This may become the behaviour of this function in the future.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>PerlIO_printf(f,fmt,...)</b>, <b>PerlIO_vprintf(f,fmt,a)</b></dt>
  <dd>These are <b>fprintf()</b>/<b>vfprintf()</b> equivalents.</dd>
  <dt><b>PerlIO_stdoutf(fmt,...)</b></dt>
  <dd>This is <b>printf()</b> equivalent. printf is #defined to this function,
      so it is (currently) legal to use
      <span class="Li">&quot;printf(fmt,...)&quot;</span> in perl sources.</dd>
  <dt><b>PerlIO_read(f,buf,count)</b>, <b>PerlIO_write(f,buf,count)</b></dt>
  <dd>These correspond functionally to <b>fread()</b> and <b>fwrite()</b> but
      the arguments and return values are different. The <b>PerlIO_read()</b>
      and <b>PerlIO_write()</b> signatures have been modeled on the more sane
      low level <b>read()</b> and <b>write()</b> functions instead: The
      &quot;file&quot; argument is passed first, there is only one
      &quot;count&quot;, and the return value can distinguish between error and
      <span class="Li">&quot;EOF&quot;</span>.
    <p class="Pp">Returns a byte count if successful (which may be zero or
        positive), returns negative value and sets
        <span class="Li">&quot;errno&quot;</span> on error. Depending on
        implementation <span class="Li">&quot;errno&quot;</span> may be
        <span class="Li">&quot;EINTR&quot;</span> if operation was interrupted
        by a signal.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>PerlIO_close(f)</b></dt>
  <dd>Depending on implementation <span class="Li">&quot;errno&quot;</span> may
      be <span class="Li">&quot;EINTR&quot;</span> if operation was interrupted
      by a signal.</dd>
  <dt><b>PerlIO_puts(f,s)</b>, <b>PerlIO_putc(f,c)</b></dt>
  <dd>These correspond to <b>fputs()</b> and <b>fputc()</b>. Note that arguments
      have been revised to have &quot;file&quot; first.</dd>
  <dt><b>PerlIO_ungetc(f,c)</b></dt>
  <dd>This corresponds to <b>ungetc()</b>. Note that arguments have been revised
      to have &quot;file&quot; first. Arranges that next read operation will
      return the byte <b>c</b>. Despite the implied &quot;character&quot; in the
      name only values in the range 0..0xFF are defined. Returns the byte
      <b>c</b> on success or -1 (<span class="Li">&quot;EOF&quot;</span>) on
      error. The number of bytes that can be &quot;pushed back&quot; may vary,
      only 1 character is certain, and then only if it is the last character
      that was read from the handle.</dd>
  <dt><b>PerlIO_getc(f)</b></dt>
  <dd>This corresponds to <b>getc()</b>. Despite the c in the name only byte
      range 0..0xFF is supported. Returns the character read or -1
      (<span class="Li">&quot;EOF&quot;</span>) on error.</dd>
  <dt><b>PerlIO_eof(f)</b></dt>
  <dd>This corresponds to <b>feof()</b>. Returns a true/false indication of
      whether the handle is at end of file. For terminal devices this may or may
      not be &quot;sticky&quot; depending on the implementation. The flag is
      cleared by <b>PerlIO_seek()</b>, or <b>PerlIO_rewind()</b>.</dd>
  <dt><b>PerlIO_error(f)</b></dt>
  <dd>This corresponds to <b>ferror()</b>. Returns a true/false indication of
      whether there has been an IO error on the handle.</dd>
  <dt><b>PerlIO_fileno(f)</b></dt>
  <dd>This corresponds to <b>fileno()</b>, note that on some platforms, the
      meaning of &quot;fileno&quot; may not match Unix. Returns -1 if the handle
      has no open descriptor associated with it.</dd>
  <dt><b>PerlIO_clearerr(f)</b></dt>
  <dd>This corresponds to <b>clearerr()</b>, i.e., clears 'error' and (usually)
      'eof' flags for the &quot;stream&quot;. Does not return a value.</dd>
  <dt><b>PerlIO_flush(f)</b></dt>
  <dd>This corresponds to <b>fflush()</b>. Sends any buffered write data to the
      underlying file. If called with <span class="Li">&quot;NULL&quot;</span>
      this may flush all open streams (or core dump with some USE_STDIO
      implementations). Calling on a handle open for read only, or on which last
      operation was a read of some kind may lead to undefined behaviour on some
      USE_STDIO implementations. The USE_PERLIO (layers) implementation tries to
      behave better: it flushes all open streams when passed
      <span class="Li">&quot;NULL&quot;</span>, and attempts to retain data on
      read streams either in the buffer or by seeking the handle to the current
      logical position.</dd>
  <dt><b>PerlIO_seek(f,offset,whence)</b></dt>
  <dd>This corresponds to <b>fseek()</b>. Sends buffered write data to the
      underlying file, or discards any buffered read data, then positions the
      file descriptor as specified by <b>offset</b> and <b>whence</b> (sic).
      This is the correct thing to do when switching between read and write on
      the same handle (see issues with <b>PerlIO_flush()</b> above). Offset is
      of type <span class="Li">&quot;Off_t&quot;</span> which is a perl
      Configure value which may not be same as stdio's
      <span class="Li">&quot;off_t&quot;</span>.</dd>
  <dt><b>PerlIO_tell(f)</b></dt>
  <dd>This corresponds to <b>ftell()</b>. Returns the current file position, or
      (Off_t) -1 on error. May just return value system &quot;knows&quot;
      without making a system call or checking the underlying file descriptor
      (so use on shared file descriptors is not safe without a
      <b>PerlIO_seek()</b>). Return value is of type
      <span class="Li">&quot;Off_t&quot;</span> which is a perl Configure value
      which may not be same as stdio's
      <span class="Li">&quot;off_t&quot;</span>.</dd>
  <dt><b>PerlIO_getpos(f,p)</b>, <b>PerlIO_setpos(f,p)</b></dt>
  <dd>These correspond (loosely) to <b>fgetpos()</b> and <b>fsetpos()</b>.
      Rather than stdio's Fpos_t they expect a &quot;Perl Scalar Value&quot; to
      be passed. What is stored there should be considered opaque. The layout of
      the data may vary from handle to handle. When not using stdio or if
      platform does not have the stdio calls then they are implemented in terms
      of <b>PerlIO_tell()</b> and <b>PerlIO_seek()</b>.</dd>
  <dt><b>PerlIO_rewind(f)</b></dt>
  <dd>This corresponds to <b>rewind()</b>. It is usually defined as being
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    PerlIO_seek(f,(Off_t)0L, SEEK_SET);
    PerlIO_clearerr(f);
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt><b></b><b>PerlIO_tmpfile()</b><b></b></dt>
  <dd>This corresponds to <b>tmpfile()</b>, i.e., returns an anonymous PerlIO or
      NULL on error. The system will attempt to automatically delete the file
      when closed. On Unix the file is usually
      <span class="Li">&quot;unlink&quot;</span>-ed just after it is created so
      it does not matter how it gets closed. On other systems the file may only
      be deleted if closed via <b>PerlIO_close()</b> and/or the program exits
      via <span class="Li">&quot;exit&quot;</span>. Depending on the
      implementation there may be &quot;race conditions&quot; which allow other
      processes access to the file, though in general it will be safer in this
      regard than ad. hoc. schemes.</dd>
  <dt><b>PerlIO_setlinebuf(f)</b></dt>
  <dd>This corresponds to <b>setlinebuf()</b>. Does not return a value. What
      constitutes a &quot;line&quot; is implementation dependent but usually
      means that writing &quot;\n&quot; flushes the buffer. What happens with
      things like &quot;this\nthat&quot; is uncertain. (Perl core uses it
      <i>only</i> when &quot;dumping&quot;; it has nothing to do with $|
      auto-flush.)</dd>

There is outline support for co-existence of PerlIO with stdio. Obviously if
  PerlIO is implemented in terms of stdio there is no problem. However in other
  cases then mechanisms must exist to create a FILE * which can be passed to
  library code which is going to use stdio calls.
<p class="Pp">The first step is to add this line:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
   #define PERLIO_NOT_STDIO 0
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><i>before</i> including any perl header files. (This will probably
    become the default at some point). That prevents &quot;perlio.h&quot; from
    attempting to #define stdio functions onto PerlIO functions.</p>
<p class="Pp">XS code is probably better using &quot;typemap&quot; if it expects
    FILE * arguments. The standard typemap will be adjusted to comprehend any
    changes in this area.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>PerlIO_importFILE(f,mode)</b></dt>
  <dd>Used to get a PerlIO * from a FILE *.
    <p class="Pp">The mode argument should be a string as would be passed to
        fopen/PerlIO_open. If it is NULL then - for legacy support - the code
        will (depending upon the platform and the implementation) either attempt
        to empirically determine the mode in which <i>f</i> is open, or use
        &quot;r+&quot; to indicate a read/write stream.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Once called the FILE * should <i>ONLY</i> be closed by calling

        PerlIO *.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The PerlIO is set to textmode. Use PerlIO_binmode if this is
        not the desired mode.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This is <b>not</b> the reverse of
      <b>PerlIO_exportFILE()</b>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>PerlIO_exportFILE(f,mode)</b></dt>
  <dd>Given a PerlIO * create a 'native' FILE * suitable for passing to code
      expecting to be compiled and linked with ANSI C <i>stdio.h</i>. The mode
      argument should be a string as would be passed to fopen/PerlIO_open. If it
      is NULL then - for legacy support - the FILE * is opened in same mode as
      the PerlIO *.
    <p class="Pp">The fact that such a FILE * has been 'exported' is recorded,
        (normally by pushing a new :stdio &quot;layer&quot; onto the PerlIO *),
        which may affect future PerlIO operations on the original PerlIO *. You

  </dd>
  <dt><b>PerlIO_releaseFILE(p,f)</b></dt>
  <dd>Calling PerlIO_releaseFILE informs PerlIO that all use of FILE * is

  <dd>Returns a native FILE * used by a stdio layer. If there is none, it will
      create one with PerlIO_exportFILE. In either case the FILE * should be

In addition to standard-like API defined so far above there is an
  &quot;implementation&quot; interface which allows perl to get at internals of
  PerlIO. The following calls correspond to the various FILE_xxx macros
  determined by Configure - or their equivalent in other implementations. This
  section is really of interest to only those concerned with detailed perl-core
  behaviour, implementing a PerlIO mapping or writing code which can make use of
  the &quot;read ahead&quot; that has been done by the IO system in the same way
  perl does. Note that any code that uses these interfaces must be prepared to
  do things the traditional way if a handle does not support them.

      <b>PerlIO_canset_cnt()</b> returns true. Currently used in only doio.c to
      force count less than -1 to -1. Perhaps should be PerlIO_set_empty or
      similar. This call may actually do nothing if &quot;count&quot; is deduced
      from pointer and a &quot;limit&quot;. Do not use this - use
      <b>PerlIO_set_ptrcnt()</b>.</dd>
  <dt><b>PerlIO_has_base(f)</b></dt>
  <dd>Returns true if implementation has a buffer, and can return pointer to
      whole buffer and its size. Used by perl for <b>-T</b> / <b>-B</b> tests.
      Other uses would be very obscure...</dd>
  <dt><b>PerlIO_get_base(f)</b></dt>
  <dd>Return <i>start</i> of buffer. Access only positive offsets in the buffer
      up to the value returned by <b>PerlIO_get_bufsiz()</b>.</dd>
  <dt><b>PerlIO_get_bufsiz(f)</b></dt>
  <dd>Return the <i>total number of bytes</i> in the buffer, this is neither the
      number that can be read, nor the amount of memory allocated to the buffer.
      Rather it is what the operating system and/or implementation happened to
      <span class="Li">&quot;read()&quot;</span> (or whatever) last time IO was
