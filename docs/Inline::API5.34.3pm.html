<p class="Pp">So you think Inline C is pretty cool, but what you really need is
    for Perl to work with the brand new programming language &quot;Foo&quot;.
    Well you're in luck. <span class="Li">&quot;Inline.pm&quot;</span> has
    support for adding your own Inline Language Support Module (<b>ILSM</b>),
    like <span class="Li">&quot;Inline::Foo&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Inline has always been intended to work with lots of different
    programming languages. Many of the details can be shared between
    implementations, so that <span class="Li">&quot;Inline::Java&quot;</span>
    has a similar interface to <span class="Li">&quot;Inline::ASM&quot;</span>.
    All of the common code is in
  <span class="Li">&quot;Inline.pm&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Language specific modules like
    <span class="Li">&quot;Inline::Python&quot;</span> are subclasses of
    <span class="Li">&quot;Inline.pm&quot;</span>. They can inherit as much of
    the common behaviour as they want, and provide specific behaviour of their
    own. This usually comes in the form of Configuration Options and language
    specific compilation.</p>
<p class="Pp">The Inline C support is probably the best boilerplate to copy
    from. Since version 0.30 all C support was isolated into the module
    <span class="Li">&quot;Inline::C&quot;</span> and the parsing grammar is
    further broken out into
    <span class="Li">&quot;Inline::C::grammar&quot;</span>. All of these
    components come with the Inline distribution.</p>
<p class="Pp">This POD gives you all the details you need for implementing an
    ILSM. For further assistance, contact inline@perl.org See [&quot;SEE
    ALSO&quot;] below.</p>
<p class="Pp">We'll examine the joke language Inline::Foo which is distributed
    with Inline. It actually is a full functioning ILSM. I use it in Inline's
    test harness to test base Inline functionality. It is very short, and can
    help you get your head wrapped around the Inline API.</p>

<p class="Pp">For the remainder of this tutorial, let's assume we're writing an
    ILSM for the ficticious language <span class="Li">&quot;Foo&quot;</span>.
    We'll call it <span class="Li">&quot;Inline::Foo&quot;</span>. Here is the
    entire (working) implementation.</p>

              unless $value =~ /^[01]$/;
            $o-&gt;{ILSM}{BAR} = $value;
            next;
        }

        {
            package Foo::Tester;

    This is a small report about the Foo code. Perhaps it contains
    information about the functions the parser found which will be
    bound to Perl. It will get included in the text produced by the
    Inline 'INFO' command.
    END
        return $text;
    }
    1;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Except for <span class="Li">&quot;load()&quot;</span>, the
    subroutines in this code are mandatory for an ILSM. What they do is
    described below. A few things to note:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;Inline::Foo&quot;</span> must be a subclass of
      Inline. This is accomplished with:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    @Inline::Foo::ISA = qw(Inline);
    </pre>
  </li>
  <li>The line '<span class="Li">&quot;require Inline;&quot;</span>' is not
      necessary. But it is there to remind you not to say
      '<span class="Li">&quot;use Inline;&quot;</span>'. This will not
    work.</li>
  <li>Remember, it is not valid for a user to say:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    use Inline::Foo;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;Inline.pm&quot;</span> will detect such
        usage for you in its <span class="Li">&quot;import&quot;</span> method,
        which is automatically inherited since
        <span class="Li">&quot;Inline::Foo&quot;</span> is a subclass.</p>
  </li>
  <li>In the build function, you normally need to parse your source code.
      Inline::C uses Parse::RecDescent to do this. Inline::Foo simply uses eval.
      (After we strip out all occurrences of 'foo-').
    <p class="Pp">An alternative parsing method that works well for many ILSMs
        (like Java and Python) is to use the language's compiler itself to parse
        for you. This works as long as the compiler can be made to give back
        parse information.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="THE_INLINE_API"><a class="permalink" href="#THE_INLINE_API">THE
  INLINE API</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">This section is a more formal specification of what functionality
    you'll need to provide to implement an ILSM.</p>
<p class="Pp">When Inline determines that some
    <span class="Li">&quot;Foo&quot;</span> code needs to be compiled it will
    automatically load your ILSM module. It will then call various subroutines
    which you need to supply. We'll call these subroutines
    &quot;callbacks&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">You will need to provide the following 5 callback subroutines.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">The <b>register()</b> Callback</h2>
<p class="Pp">This subroutine receives no arguments. It returns a reference to a
    hash of ILSM meta-data. Inline calls this routine only when it is trying to
    detect new ILSM-s that have been installed on a given system. Here is an
    example of the has ref you would return for Foo:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    {
        language =&gt; 'Foo',
        aliases =&gt; ['foo'],
        type =&gt; 'interpreted',
        suffix =&gt; 'foo',
    };
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The meta-data items have the following meanings:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="language"><a class="permalink" href="#language">language</a></dt>
  <dd>This is the proper name of the language. It is usually implemented as
      <span class="Li">&quot;Inline::X&quot;</span> for a given language
    'X'.</dd>
  <dt id="aliases"><a class="permalink" href="#aliases">aliases</a></dt>
  <dd>This is a reference to an array of language name aliases. The proper name
      of a language can only contain word characters. A-Za-z0-9_ An alias can
      contain any characters except whitespace and quotes. This is useful for
      names like 'C++' and 'C#'.</dd>
  <dt id="type"><a class="permalink" href="#type">type</a></dt>
  <dd>Must be set to 'compiled' or 'interpreted'. Indicates the category of the
      language.</dd>
  <dt id="suffix"><a class="permalink" href="#suffix">suffix</a></dt>
  <dd>This is the file extension for the cached object that will be created. For
      'compiled' languages, it will probably be 'so' or 'dll'. The appropriate
      value is in <span class="Li">&quot;Config.pm&quot;</span>.
    <p class="Pp">For interpreted languages, this value can be whatever you
        want. Python uses <span class="Li">&quot;pydat&quot;</span>. Foo uses
        <span class="Li">&quot;foo&quot;</span>.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">The <b>validate()</b> Callback</h2>
<p class="Pp">This routine gets passed all configuration options that were not
    already handled by the base Inline module. The options are passed as
    key/value pairs. It is up to you to validate each option and store its value
    in the Inline object (which is also passed in). If a particular option is
    invalid, you should croak with an appropriate error message.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that all the keywords this routine receives will be converted
    to upper- case by <span class="Li">&quot;Inline&quot;</span>, whatever case
    the program gave.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">The <b>build()</b> Callback</h2>
<p class="Pp">This subroutine is responsible for doing the parsing and
    compilation of the Foo source code. The Inline object is passed as the only
    argument. All pertinent information will be stored in this object.
    <span class="Li">&quot;build()&quot;</span> is required to create a cache
    object of a specific name, or to croak with an appropriate error
  message.</p>
<p class="Pp">This is the meat of your ILSM. Since it will most likely be quite
    complicated, it is probably best that you study an existing ILSM like
    <span class="Li">&quot;Inline::C&quot;</span>.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">The <b>load()</b> Callback</h2>
<p class="Pp">This method only needs to be provided for interpreted languages.
    It's responsibility is to start the interpreter.</p>
<p class="Pp">For compiled languages, the load routine from
    <span class="Li">&quot;Inline.pm&quot;</span> is called which uses
    <span class="Li">&quot;DynaLoader&quot;</span> to load the shared object or
    DLL.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">The <b>info()</b> Callback</h2>
<p class="Pp">This method is called when the user makes use of the
    <span class="Li">&quot;INFO&quot;</span> shortcut. You should return a
    string containing a small report about the Inlined code.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="THE_INLINE_OBJECT"><a class="permalink" href="#THE_INLINE_OBJECT">THE
  INLINE OBJECT</a></h1>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;Inline.pm&quot;</span> creates a hash based
    Perl object for each section of Inlined source code it receives. This object
    contains lots of information about the code, the environment, and the
    configuration options used.</p>
<p class="Pp">This object is a hash that is broken into several subhashes. The
    only two subhashes that an ILSM should use at all are
    <span class="Li">$o</span>-&gt;{API} and
    <span class="Li">$o</span>-&gt;{ILSM}. The first one contains all of the
    information that Inline has gather for you in order for you to create/load a
    cached object of your design. The second one is a repository where your ILSM
    can freely store data that it might need later on.</p>
<p class="Pp">This section will describe all of the Inline object
    &quot;API&quot; attributes.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">

<p class="Pp">The Inline community will decide if your implementation of COBOL

    <span class="Li">&quot;Inline::COBOL&quot;</span> or should use an alternate
    namespace. In matters of dispute, I (Ingy d&#x00F6;t Net) retain final
    authority. (and I hope not to need use of it :-) Actually modules@perl.org
    retains the <b>final</b> authority.</p>
<p class="Pp">But even if you want to work alone, you are free and welcome to
