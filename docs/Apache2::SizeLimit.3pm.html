    This version is only for httpd 2.x and mod_perl 2.x
    series.

</pre>
<p class="Pp">******************************** NOTICE *******************</p>
<p class="Pp">This module allows you to kill off Apache httpd processes if they
    grow too large. You can make the decision to kill a process based on its
    overall size, by setting a minimum limit on shared memory, or a maximum on
    unshared memory.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can set limits for each of these sizes, and if any limit is
    exceeded, the process will be killed.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can also limit the frequency that these sizes are checked so
    that this module only checks every N requests.</p>
<p class="Pp">This module is highly platform dependent, please read the
    &quot;PER-PLATFORM BEHAVIOR&quot; section for details. It is possible that
    this module simply does not support your platform.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="API"><a class="permalink" href="#API">API</a></h1>
You can set set the size limits from a Perl module or script loaded by Apache by
  calling the appropriate class method on
  <span class="Li">&quot;Apache2::SizeLimit&quot;</span>:
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Apache2::SizeLimit-&gt;set_max_process_size($size)
    <p class="Pp">This sets the maximum size of the process, including both
        shared and unshared memory.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Apache2::SizeLimit-&gt;set_max_unshared_size($size)
    <p class="Pp">This sets the maximum amount of <i>unshared</i> memory the
        process can use.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Apache2::SizeLimit-&gt;set_min_shared_size($size)
    <p class="Pp">This sets the minimum amount of shared memory the process must
        have.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">The two methods related to shared memory size are effectively a
    no-op if the module cannot determine the shared memory size for your
    platform. See &quot;PER-PLATFORM BEHAVIOR&quot; for more details.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Running_the__fBhandler()_fP"><a class="permalink" href="#Running_the__fBhandler()_fP">Running
  the <b>handler()</b></a></h2>
There are several ways to make this module actually run the code to kill a
  process.
<p class="Pp">The simplest is to make
    <span class="Li">&quot;Apache2::SizeLimit&quot;</span> a
    <span class="Li">&quot;PerlCleanupHandler&quot;</span> in your Apache
    config:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    PerlCleanupHandler Apache2::SizeLimit
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This will ensure that
    <span class="Li">&quot;Apache2::SizeLimit-&gt;handler()&quot;</span> is run
    for all requests.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you want to combine this module with a cleanup handler of your
    own, make sure that <span class="Li">&quot;Apache2::SizeLimit&quot;</span>
    is the last handler run:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    PerlCleanupHandler  Apache2::SizeLimit My::CleanupHandler
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Remember, mod_perl will run stacked handlers from right to left,
    as they're defined in your configuration.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you have some cleanup code you need to run, but stacked
    handlers aren't appropriate for your setup, you can also explicitly call the
    <span class="Li">&quot;Apache2::SizeLimit-&gt;handler()&quot;</span>
    function from your own cleanup handler:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    package My::CleanupHandler

    sub handler {
        my $r = shift;

        # Causes File::Temp to remove any temp dirs created during the
        # request
        File::Temp::cleanup();

        return Apache2::SizeLimit-&gt;handler($r);
    }
</pre>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd>Apache2::SizeLimit-&gt;add_cleanup_handler($r)
    <p class="Pp">You can call this method inside a request to run
        <span class="Li">&quot;Apache2::SizeLimit&quot;</span>'s
        <span class="Li">&quot;handler()&quot;</span> method for just that
        request. It's safe to call this method repeatedly -- the cleanup will
        only be run once per request.</p>

Since checking the process size can take a few system calls on some platforms
  (e.g. linux), you may not want to check the process size for every request.
<dl class="Bl-tag">

  <dd>Apache2::SizeLimit-&gt;set_check_interval($interval)
    <p class="Pp">Calling this causes

        process size every <span class="Li">$interval</span> requests. If you

In addition to simply checking the total size of a process, this module can
  factor in how much of the memory used by the process is actually being shared
  by copy-on-write. If you don't understand how memory is shared in this way,
  take a look at the mod_perl docs at http://perl.apache.org/docs/.
<p class="Pp">You can take advantage of the shared memory information by setting
    a minimum shared size and/or a maximum unshared size. Experience on one
    heavily trafficked mod_perl site showed that setting maximum unshared size
    and leaving the others unset is the most effective policy. This is because
    it only kills off processes that are truly using too much physical RAM,
    allowing most processes to live longer and reducing the process churn
  rate.</p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="PER-PLATFORM_BEHAVIOR"><a class="permalink" href="#PER-PLATFORM_BEHAVIOR">PER-PLATFORM
  BEHAVIOR</a></h1>
This module is highly platform dependent, since finding the size of a process is
  different for each OS, and some platforms may not be supported. In particular,
  the limits on minimum shared memory and maximum shared memory are currently
  only supported on Linux and BSD. If you can contribute support for another OS,
  patches are very welcome.
<p class="Pp">Currently supported OSes:</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="linux"><a class="permalink" href="#linux">linux</a></h2>
For linux we read the process size out of <i>/proc/self/statm</i>. If you are
  worried about performance, you can consider using
  <span class="Li">&quot;Apache2::SizeLimit-&gt;set_check_interval()&quot;</span>
  to reduce how often this read happens.
<p class="Pp">As of linux 2.6, <i>/proc/self/statm</i> does not report the
    amount of memory shared by the copy-on-write mechanism as shared memory.
    This means that decisions made based on shared memory as reported by that
    interface are inherently wrong.</p>
<p class="Pp">However, as of the 2.6.14 release of the kernel, there is
    <i>/proc/self/smaps</i> entry for each process. <i>/proc/self/smaps</i>
    reports various sizes for each memory segment of a process and allows us to
    count the amount of shared memory correctly.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <span class="Li">&quot;Apache2::SizeLimit&quot;</span> detects
    a kernel that supports <i>/proc/self/smaps</i> and the
    <span class="Li">&quot;Linux::Smaps&quot;</span> module is installed it will
    use that module instead of <i>/proc/self/statm</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Reading <i>/proc/self/smaps</i> is expensive compared to
    <i>/proc/self/statm</i>. It must look at each page table entry of a process.
    Further, on multiprocessor systems the access is synchronized with
    spinlocks. Again, you might consider using
    <span class="Li">&quot;Apache2::SizeLimit-&gt;set_check_interval()&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Copy-on-write and Shared Memory</i></p>
<p class="Pp">The following example shows the effect of copy-on-write:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  &lt;Perl&gt;
    require Apache2::SizeLimit;
    package X;
    use strict;
    use Apache2::Const -compile =&gt; qw(OK);

    my $x = &quot;a&quot; x (1024*1024);

    sub handler {
      my $r = shift;
      my ($size, $shared) = $Apache2::SizeLimit-&gt;_check_size();
      $x =~ tr/a/b/;
      my ($size2, $shared2) = $Apache2::SizeLimit-&gt;_check_size();
      $r-&gt;content_type('text/plain');
      $r-&gt;print(&quot;1: size=$size shared=$shared\n&quot;);
      $r-&gt;print(&quot;2: size=$size2 shared=$shared2\n&quot;);
      return OK;
    }
  &lt;/Perl&gt;

  &lt;Location /X&gt;
    SetHandler modperl
    PerlResponseHandler X
  &lt;/Location&gt;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The parent Apache process allocates memory for the string in
    <span class="Li">$x</span>. The
    <span class="Li">&quot;tr&quot;</span>-command then overwrites all
    &quot;a&quot; with &quot;b&quot; if the handler is called with an argument.
    This write is done in place, thus, the process size doesn't change. Only
    <span class="Li">$x</span> is not shared anymore by means of copy-on-write
    between the parent and the child.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <i>/proc/self/smaps</i> is available curl shows:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  r2@s93:~/work/mp2&gt; curl http://localhost:8181/X
  1: size=13452 shared=7456
  2: size=13452 shared=6432
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Shared memory has lost 1024 kB. The process' overall size remains
    unchanged.</p>
<p class="Pp">Without <i>/proc/self/smaps</i> it says:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  r2@s93:~/work/mp2&gt; curl http://localhost:8181/X
  1: size=13052 shared=3628
  2: size=13052 shared=3636
</pre>
<p class="Pp">One can see the kernel lies about the shared memory. It simply
    doesn't count copy-on-write pages as shared.</p>

For solaris we simply retrieve the size of <i>/proc/self/as</i>, which contains
  the address-space image of the process, and convert to KB. Shared memory
  calculations are not supported.
<p class="Pp">NOTE: This is only known to work for solaris 2.6 and above.
    Evidently the <i>/proc</i> filesystem has changed between 2.5.1 and 2.6. Can
    anyone confirm or deny?</p>

Uses <span class="Li">&quot;BSD::Resource::getrusage()&quot;</span> to determine

<p class="Pp">According to recent tests on OSX (July, 2006),
    <span class="Li">&quot;BSD::Resource&quot;</span> simply reports zero for

  THIS MODULE</a></h1>
This module was written in response to questions on the mod_perl mailing list on
  how to tell the httpd process to exit if it gets too big.
<p class="Pp">Actually, there are two big reasons your httpd children will grow.
    First, your code could have a bug that causes the process to increase in
    size very quickly. Second, you could just be doing operations that require a
    lot of memory for each request. Since Perl does not give memory back to the
    system after using it, the process size can grow quite large.</p>
<p class="Pp">This module will not really help you with the first problem. For
    that you should probably look into
    <span class="Li">&quot;Apache::Resource&quot;</span> or some other means of
    setting a limit on the data size of your program. BSD-ish systems have
    <span class="Li">&quot;setrlimit()&quot;</span>, which will kill your memory
    gobbling processes. However, it is a little violent, terminating your
    process in mid-request.</p>
<p class="Pp">This module attempts to solve the second situation, where your
    process slowly grows over time. It checks memory usage after every request,
    and if it exceeds a threshold, exits gracefully.</p>
<p class="Pp">By using this module, you should be able to discontinue using the
    Apache configuration directive <b>MaxRequestsPerChild</b>, although for some
    folks, using both in combination does the job.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DEPRECATED_APIS"><a class="permalink" href="#DEPRECATED_APIS">DEPRECATED

Previous versions of this module documented three globals for defining memory
  size limits:
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li><span class="Li">$Apache2::SizeLimit::MAX_PROCESS_SIZE</span></li>
  <li><span class="Li">$Apache2::SizeLimit::MIN_SHARE_SIZE</span></li>
  <li><span class="Li">$Apache2::SizeLimit::MAX_UNSHARED_SIZE</span></li>
  <li><span class="Li">$Apache2::SizeLimit::CHECK_EVERY_N_REQUESTS</span></li>
  <li><span class="Li">$Apache2::SizeLimit::USE_SMAPS</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">Direct use of these globals is deprecated, but will continue to
    work for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p class="Pp">It also documented three functions for use from registry
  scripts:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li><b>Apache2::SizeLimit::setmax()</b></li>
  <li><b>Apache2::SizeLimit::setmin()</b></li>
  <li><b>Apache2::SizeLimit::setmax_unshared()</b></li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">Besides setting the appropriate limit, these functions <i>also</i>
    add a cleanup handler to the current request. In the 2.x series of mod_perl
    to use the deprecated functions, you must set PerlOptions +GlobalRequest
    accordingly.</p>
