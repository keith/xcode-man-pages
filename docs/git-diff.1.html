Show changes between the working tree and the index or a tree, changes between
  the index and a tree, changes between two trees, changes resulting from a
  merge, changes between two blob objects, or changes between two files on disk.
<p class="Pp"><i>git diff</i> [&lt;options&gt;] [--] [&lt;path&gt;...]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This form is to view the changes you made relative to the
  index (staging area for the next commit). In other words, the differences are
  what you <i>could</i> tell Git to further add to the index but you still
  haven&#x2019;t. You can stage these changes by using <b>git-add</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>git diff</i> [&lt;options&gt;] --no-index [--] &lt;path&gt;
    &lt;path&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This form is to compare the given two paths on the
  filesystem. You can omit the <b>--no-index</b> option when running the command
  in a working tree controlled by Git and at least one of the paths points
  outside the working tree, or when running the command outside a working tree
  controlled by Git. This form implies <b>--exit-code</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>git diff</i> [&lt;options&gt;] --cached [--merge-base]
    [&lt;commit&gt;] [--] [&lt;path&gt;...]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This form is to view the changes you staged for the next
  commit relative to the named &lt;commit&gt;. Typically you would want
  comparison with the latest commit, so if you do not give &lt;commit&gt;, it
  defaults to HEAD. If HEAD does not exist (e.g. unborn branches) and
  &lt;commit&gt; is not given, it shows all staged changes. --staged is a
  synonym of --cached.
<p class="Pp">If --merge-base is given, instead of using &lt;commit&gt;, use the
    merge base of &lt;commit&gt; and HEAD. <b>git diff --merge-base A</b> is
    equivalent to <b>git diff $(git merge-base A HEAD)</b>.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>git diff</i> [&lt;options&gt;] &lt;commit&gt; [--]
    [&lt;path&gt;...]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This form is to view the changes you have in your working
  tree relative to the named &lt;commit&gt;. You can use HEAD to compare it with
  the latest commit, or a branch name to compare with the tip of a different
  branch.</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>git diff</i> [&lt;options&gt;] [--merge-base] &lt;commit&gt;
    &lt;commit&gt; [--] [&lt;path&gt;...]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This is to view the changes between two arbitrary
  &lt;commit&gt;.
<p class="Pp">If --merge-base is given, use the merge base of the two commits
    for the &quot;before&quot; side. <b>git diff --merge-base A B</b> is
    equivalent to <b>git diff $(git merge-base A B) B</b>.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>git diff</i> [&lt;options&gt;] &lt;commit&gt; &lt;commit&gt;...
    &lt;commit&gt; [--] [&lt;path&gt;...]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This form is to view the results of a merge commit. The
  first listed &lt;commit&gt; must be the merge itself; the remaining two or
  more commits should be its parents. A convenient way to produce the desired
  set of revisions is to use the <b>^@</b> suffix. For instance, if
  <b>master</b> names a merge commit, <b>git diff master master^@</b> gives the
  same combined diff as <b>git show master</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>git diff</i> [&lt;options&gt;] &lt;commit&gt;..&lt;commit&gt;
    [--] [&lt;path&gt;...]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This is synonymous to the earlier form (without the
  <b>..</b>) for viewing the changes between two arbitrary &lt;commit&gt;. If
  &lt;commit&gt; on one side is omitted, it will have the same effect as using
  HEAD instead.</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>git diff</i> [&lt;options&gt;] &lt;commit&gt;...&lt;commit&gt;
    [--] [&lt;path&gt;...]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This form is to view the changes on the branch containing
  and up to the second &lt;commit&gt;, starting at a common ancestor of both
  &lt;commit&gt;. <b>git diff A...B</b> is equivalent to <b>git diff $(git
  merge-base A B) B</b>. You can omit any one of &lt;commit&gt;, which has the
  same effect as using HEAD instead.</div>
<p class="Pp">Just in case you are doing something exotic, it should be noted
    that all of the &lt;commit&gt; in the above description, except in the
    <b>--merge-base</b> case and in the last two forms that use <b>..</b>
    notations, can be any &lt;tree&gt;.</p>
<p class="Pp">For a more complete list of ways to spell &lt;commit&gt;, see
    &quot;SPECIFYING REVISIONS&quot; section in <b>gitrevisions</b>(7). However,
    &quot;diff&quot; is about comparing two <i>endpoints</i>, not ranges, and
    the range notations (<b>&lt;commit&gt;..&lt;commit&gt;</b> and
    <b>&lt;commit&gt;...&lt;commit&gt;</b>) do not mean a range as defined in
    the &quot;SPECIFYING RANGES&quot; section in <b>gitrevisions</b>(7).</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>git diff</i> [&lt;options&gt;] &lt;blob&gt; &lt;blob&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This form is to view the differences between the raw
  contents of two blob objects.</div>

<h1 class="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
-p, -u, --patch
<div class="Bd-indent">Generate patch (see section on generating patches). This
  is the default.</div>
<p class="Pp">-s, --no-patch</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Suppress diff output. Useful for commands like <b>git
  show</b> that show the patch by default, or to cancel the effect of
  <b>--patch</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">-U&lt;n&gt;, --unified=&lt;n&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Generate diffs with &lt;n&gt; lines of context instead of
  the usual three. Implies <b>--patch</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--output=&lt;file&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Output to a specific file instead of stdout.</div>
<p class="Pp">--output-indicator-new=&lt;char&gt;,
    --output-indicator-old=&lt;char&gt;,
  --output-indicator-context=&lt;char&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Specify the character used to indicate new, old or
  context lines in the generated patch. Normally they are <i>+</i>, <i>-</i> and
  ' ' respectively.</div>
<p class="Pp">--raw</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Generate the diff in raw format.</div>
<p class="Pp">--patch-with-raw</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Synonym for <b>-p --raw</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--indent-heuristic</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Enable the heuristic that shifts diff hunk boundaries to
  make patches easier to read. This is the default.</div>
<p class="Pp">--no-indent-heuristic</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Disable the indent heuristic.</div>
<p class="Pp">--minimal</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Spend extra time to make sure the smallest possible diff
  is produced.</div>
<p class="Pp">--patience</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Generate a diff using the &quot;patience diff&quot;
  algorithm.</div>
<p class="Pp">--histogram</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Generate a diff using the &quot;histogram diff&quot;
  algorithm.</div>
<p class="Pp">--anchored=&lt;text&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Generate a diff using the &quot;anchored diff&quot;
  algorithm.
<p class="Pp">This option may be specified more than once.</p>
<p class="Pp">If a line exists in both the source and destination, exists only
    once, and starts with this text, this algorithm attempts to prevent it from
    appearing as a deletion or addition in the output. It uses the
    &quot;patience diff&quot; algorithm internally.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--diff-algorithm={patience|minimal|histogram|myers}</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Choose a diff algorithm. The variants are as follows:
<p class="Pp"><b>default</b>, <b>myers</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The basic greedy diff algorithm. Currently, this is the
  default.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>minimal</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Spend extra time to make sure the smallest possible diff
  is produced.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>patience</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Use &quot;patience diff&quot; algorithm when generating
  patches.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>histogram</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This algorithm extends the patience algorithm to
  &quot;support low-occurrence common elements&quot;.</div>
<p class="Pp">For instance, if you configured the <b>diff.algorithm</b> variable
    to a non-default value and want to use the default one, then you have to use
    <b>--diff-algorithm=default</b> option.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--stat[=&lt;width&gt;[,&lt;name-width&gt;[,&lt;count&gt;]]]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Generate a diffstat. By default, as much space as
  necessary will be used for the filename part, and the rest for the graph part.
  Maximum width defaults to terminal width, or 80 columns if not connected to a
  terminal, and can be overridden by <b>&lt;width&gt;</b>. The width of the
  filename part can be limited by giving another width <b>&lt;name-width&gt;</b>
  after a comma. The width of the graph part can be limited by using
  <b>--stat-graph-width=&lt;width&gt;</b> (affects all commands generating a
  stat graph) or by setting <b>diff.statGraphWidth=&lt;width&gt;</b> (does not
  affect <b>git format-patch</b>). By giving a third parameter
  <b>&lt;count&gt;</b>, you can limit the output to the first
  <b>&lt;count&gt;</b> lines, followed by <b>...</b> if there are more.
<p class="Pp">These parameters can also be set individually with
    <b>--stat-width=&lt;width&gt;</b>,
    <b>--stat-name-width=&lt;name-width&gt;</b> and
    <b>--stat-count=&lt;count&gt;</b>.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--compact-summary</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Output a condensed summary of extended header information
  such as file creations or deletions (&quot;new&quot; or &quot;gone&quot;,
  optionally &quot;+l&quot; if it&#x2019;s a symlink) and mode changes
  (&quot;+x&quot; or &quot;-x&quot; for adding or removing executable bit
  respectively) in diffstat. The information is put between the filename part
  and the graph part. Implies <b>--stat</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--numstat</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Similar to <b>--stat</b>, but shows number of added and
  deleted lines in decimal notation and pathname without abbreviation, to make
  it more machine friendly. For binary files, outputs two <b>-</b> instead of
  saying <b>0 0</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--shortstat</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Output only the last line of the <b>--stat</b> format
  containing total number of modified files, as well as number of added and
  deleted lines.</div>
<p class="Pp">-X[&lt;param1,param2,...&gt;],
    --dirstat[=&lt;param1,param2,...&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Output the distribution of relative amount of changes for
  each sub-directory. The behavior of <b>--dirstat</b> can be customized by
  passing it a comma separated list of parameters. The defaults are controlled
  by the <b>diff.dirstat</b> configuration variable (see <b>git-config</b>(1)).
  The following parameters are available:
<p class="Pp"><b>changes</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Compute the dirstat numbers by counting the lines that
  have been removed from the source, or added to the destination. This ignores
  the amount of pure code movements within a file. In other words, rearranging
  lines in a file is not counted as much as other changes. This is the default
  behavior when no parameter is given.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>lines</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Compute the dirstat numbers by doing the regular
  line-based diff analysis, and summing the removed/added line counts. (For
  binary files, count 64-byte chunks instead, since binary files have no natural
  concept of lines). This is a more expensive <b>--dirstat</b> behavior than the
  <b>changes</b> behavior, but it does count rearranged lines within a file as
  much as other changes. The resulting output is consistent with what you get
  from the other <b>--*stat</b> options.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>files</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Compute the dirstat numbers by counting the number of
  files changed. Each changed file counts equally in the dirstat analysis. This
  is the computationally cheapest <b>--dirstat</b> behavior, since it does not
  have to look at the file contents at all.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>cumulative</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Count changes in a child directory for the parent
  directory as well. Note that when using <b>cumulative</b>, the sum of the
  percentages reported may exceed 100%. The default (non-cumulative) behavior
  can be specified with the <b>noncumulative</b> parameter.</div>
<p class="Pp">&lt;limit&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">An integer parameter specifies a cut-off percent (3% by
  default). Directories contributing less than this percentage of the changes
  are not shown in the output.</div>
<p class="Pp">Example: The following will count changed files, while ignoring
    directories with less than 10% of the total amount of changed files, and
    accumulating child directory counts in the parent directories:
    <b>--dirstat=files,10,cumulative</b>.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--cumulative</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Synonym for --dirstat=cumulative</div>
<p class="Pp">--dirstat-by-file[=&lt;param1,param2&gt;...]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Synonym for --dirstat=files,param1,param2...</div>
<p class="Pp">--summary</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Output a condensed summary of extended header information
  such as creations, renames and mode changes.</div>
<p class="Pp">--patch-with-stat</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Synonym for <b>-p --stat</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">-z</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When <b>--raw</b>, <b>--numstat</b>, <b>--name-only</b>
  or <b>--name-status</b> has been given, do not munge pathnames and use NULs as
  output field terminators.
<p class="Pp">Without this option, pathnames with &quot;unusual&quot; characters
    are quoted as explained for the configuration variable <b>core.quotePath</b>
    (see <b>git-config</b>(1)).</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--name-only</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show only names of changed files. The file names are
  often encoded in UTF-8. For more information see the discussion about encoding
  in the <b>git-log</b>(1) manual page.</div>
<p class="Pp">--name-status</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show only names and status of changed files. See the
  description of the <b>--diff-filter</b> option on what the status letters
  mean. Just like <b>--name-only</b> the file names are often encoded in
  UTF-8.</div>
<p class="Pp">--submodule[=&lt;format&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Specify how differences in submodules are shown. When
  specifying <b>--submodule=short</b> the <i>short</i> format is used. This
  format just shows the names of the commits at the beginning and end of the
  range. When <b>--submodule</b> or <b>--submodule=log</b> is specified, the
  <i>log</i> format is used. This format lists the commits in the range like
  <b>git-submodule</b>(1) <b>summary</b> does. When <b>--submodule=diff</b> is
  specified, the <i>diff</i> format is used. This format shows an inline diff of
  the changes in the submodule contents between the commit range. Defaults to
  <b>diff.submodule</b> or the <i>short</i> format if the config option is
  unset.</div>
<p class="Pp">--color[=&lt;when&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show colored diff. <b>--color</b> (i.e. without
  <i>=&lt;when&gt;</i>) is the same as <b>--color=always</b>.
  <i>&lt;when&gt;</i> can be one of <b>always</b>, <b>never</b>, or <b>auto</b>.
  It can be changed by the <b>color.ui</b> and <b>color.diff</b> configuration
  settings.</div>
<p class="Pp">--no-color</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Turn off colored diff. This can be used to override
  configuration settings. It is the same as <b>--color=never</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--color-moved[=&lt;mode&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Moved lines of code are colored differently. It can be
  changed by the <b>diff.colorMoved</b> configuration setting. The &lt;mode&gt;
  defaults to <i>no</i> if the option is not given and to <i>zebra</i> if the
  option with no mode is given. The mode must be one of:
<p class="Pp">no</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Moved lines are not highlighted.</div>
<p class="Pp">default</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Is a synonym for <b>zebra</b>. This may change to a more
  sensible mode in the future.</div>
<p class="Pp">plain</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Any line that is added in one location and was removed in
  another location will be colored with <i>color.diff.newMoved</i>. Similarly
  <i>color.diff.oldMoved</i> will be used for removed lines that are added
  somewhere else in the diff. This mode picks up any moved line, but it is not
  very useful in a review to determine if a block of code was moved without
  permutation.</div>
<p class="Pp">blocks</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Blocks of moved text of at least 20 alphanumeric
  characters are detected greedily. The detected blocks are painted using either
  the <i>color.diff.{old,new}Moved</i> color. Adjacent blocks cannot be told
  apart.</div>
<p class="Pp">zebra</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Blocks of moved text are detected as in <i>blocks</i>
  mode. The blocks are painted using either the <i>color.diff.{old,new}Moved</i>
  color or <i>color.diff.{old,new}MovedAlternative</i>. The change between the
  two colors indicates that a new block was detected.</div>
<p class="Pp">dimmed-zebra</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Similar to <i>zebra</i>, but additional dimming of
  uninteresting parts of moved code is performed. The bordering lines of two
  adjacent blocks are considered interesting, the rest is uninteresting.
  <b>dimmed_zebra</b> is a deprecated synonym.</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--no-color-moved</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Turn off move detection. This can be used to override
  configuration settings. It is the same as <b>--color-moved=no</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--color-moved-ws=&lt;modes&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This configures how whitespace is ignored when performing
  the move detection for <b>--color-moved</b>. It can be set by the
  <b>diff.colorMovedWS</b> configuration setting. These modes can be given as a
  comma separated list:
<p class="Pp">no</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Do not ignore whitespace when performing move
  detection.</div>
<p class="Pp">ignore-space-at-eol</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Ignore changes in whitespace at EOL.</div>
<p class="Pp">ignore-space-change</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Ignore changes in amount of whitespace. This ignores
  whitespace at line end, and considers all other sequences of one or more
  whitespace characters to be equivalent.</div>
<p class="Pp">ignore-all-space</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Ignore whitespace when comparing lines. This ignores
  differences even if one line has whitespace where the other line has
  none.</div>
<p class="Pp">allow-indentation-change</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Initially ignore any whitespace in the move detection,
  then group the moved code blocks only into a block if the change in whitespace
  is the same per line. This is incompatible with the other modes.</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--no-color-moved-ws</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Do not ignore whitespace when performing move detection.
  This can be used to override configuration settings. It is the same as
  <b>--color-moved-ws=no</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--word-diff[=&lt;mode&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show a word diff, using the &lt;mode&gt; to delimit
  changed words. By default, words are delimited by whitespace; see
  <b>--word-diff-regex</b> below. The &lt;mode&gt; defaults to <i>plain</i>, and
  must be one of:
<p class="Pp">color</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Highlight changed words using only colors. Implies
  <b>--color</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">plain</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show words as <b>[-removed-]</b> and <b>{+added+}</b>.
  Makes no attempts to escape the delimiters if they appear in the input, so the
  output may be ambiguous.</div>
<p class="Pp">porcelain</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Use a special line-based format intended for script
  consumption. Added/removed/unchanged runs are printed in the usual unified
  diff format, starting with a <b>+</b>/<b>-</b>/` ` character at the beginning
  of the line and extending to the end of the line. Newlines in the input are
  represented by a tilde <b>~</b> on a line of its own.</div>
<p class="Pp">none</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Disable word diff again.</div>
<p class="Pp">Note that despite the name of the first mode, color is used to
    highlight the changed parts in all modes if enabled.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--word-diff-regex=&lt;regex&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Use &lt;regex&gt; to decide what a word is, instead of
  considering runs of non-whitespace to be a word. Also implies
  <b>--word-diff</b> unless it was already enabled.
<p class="Pp">Every non-overlapping match of the &lt;regex&gt; is considered a
    word. Anything between these matches is considered whitespace and ignored(!)
    for the purposes of finding differences. You may want to append
    <b>|[^[:space:]]</b> to your regular expression to make sure that it matches
    all non-whitespace characters. A match that contains a newline is silently
    truncated(!) at the newline.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, <b>--word-diff-regex=.</b> will treat each character
    as a word and, correspondingly, show differences character by character.</p>
<p class="Pp">The regex can also be set via a diff driver or configuration
    option, see <b>gitattributes</b>(5) or <b>git-config</b>(1). Giving it
    explicitly overrides any diff driver or configuration setting. Diff drivers
    override configuration settings.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--color-words[=&lt;regex&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Equivalent to <b>--word-diff=color</b> plus (if a regex
  was specified) <b>--word-diff-regex=&lt;regex&gt;</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--no-renames</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Turn off rename detection, even when the configuration
  file gives the default to do so.</div>
<p class="Pp">--[no-]rename-empty</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Whether to use empty blobs as rename source.</div>
<p class="Pp">--check</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Warn if changes introduce conflict markers or whitespace
  errors. What are considered whitespace errors is controlled by
  <b>core.whitespace</b> configuration. By default, trailing whitespaces
  (including lines that consist solely of whitespaces) and a space character
  that is immediately followed by a tab character inside the initial indent of
  the line are considered whitespace errors. Exits with non-zero status if
  problems are found. Not compatible with --exit-code.</div>
<p class="Pp">--ws-error-highlight=&lt;kind&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Highlight whitespace errors in the <b>context</b>,
  <b>old</b> or <b>new</b> lines of the diff. Multiple values are separated by
  comma, <b>none</b> resets previous values, <b>default</b> reset the list to
  <b>new</b> and <b>all</b> is a shorthand for <b>old,new,context</b>. When this
  option is not given, and the configuration variable
  <b>diff.wsErrorHighlight</b> is not set, only whitespace errors in <b>new</b>
  lines are highlighted. The whitespace errors are colored with
  <b>color.diff.whitespace</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--full-index</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Instead of the first handful of characters, show the full
  pre- and post-image blob object names on the &quot;index&quot; line when
  generating patch format output.</div>
<p class="Pp">--binary</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">In addition to <b>--full-index</b>, output a binary diff
  that can be applied with <b>git-apply</b>. Implies <b>--patch</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--abbrev[=&lt;n&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Instead of showing the full 40-byte hexadecimal object
  name in diff-raw format output and diff-tree header lines, show the shortest
  prefix that is at least <i>&lt;n&gt;</i> hexdigits long that uniquely refers
  the object. In diff-patch output format, <b>--full-index</b> takes higher
  precedence, i.e. if <b>--full-index</b> is specified, full blob names will be
  shown regardless of <b>--abbrev</b>. Non default number of digits can be
  specified with <b>--abbrev=&lt;n&gt;</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">-B[&lt;n&gt;][/&lt;m&gt;],
    --break-rewrites[=[&lt;n&gt;][/&lt;m&gt;]]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Break complete rewrite changes into pairs of delete and
  create. This serves two purposes:
<p class="Pp">It affects the way a change that amounts to a total rewrite of a
    file not as a series of deletion and insertion mixed together with a very
    few lines that happen to match textually as the context, but as a single
    deletion of everything old followed by a single insertion of everything new,
    and the number <b>m</b> controls this aspect of the -B option (defaults to
    60%). <b>-B/70%</b> specifies that less than 30% of the original should
    remain in the result for Git to consider it a total rewrite (i.e. otherwise
    the resulting patch will be a series of deletion and insertion mixed
    together with context lines).</p>
<p class="Pp">When used with -M, a totally-rewritten file is also considered as
    the source of a rename (usually -M only considers a file that disappeared as
    the source of a rename), and the number <b>n</b> controls this aspect of the
    -B option (defaults to 50%). <b>-B20%</b> specifies that a change with
    addition and deletion compared to 20% or more of the file&#x2019;s size are
    eligible for being picked up as a possible source of a rename to another
    file.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">-M[&lt;n&gt;], --find-renames[=&lt;n&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Detect renames. If <b>n</b> is specified, it is a
  threshold on the similarity index (i.e. amount of addition/deletions compared
  to the file&#x2019;s size). For example, <b>-M90%</b> means Git should
  consider a delete/add pair to be a rename if more than 90% of the file
  hasn&#x2019;t changed. Without a <b>%</b> sign, the number is to be read as a
  fraction, with a decimal point before it. I.e., <b>-M5</b> becomes 0.5, and is
  thus the same as <b>-M50%</b>. Similarly, <b>-M05</b> is the same as
  <b>-M5%</b>. To limit detection to exact renames, use <b>-M100%</b>. The
  default similarity index is 50%.</div>
<p class="Pp">-C[&lt;n&gt;], --find-copies[=&lt;n&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Detect copies as well as renames. See also
  <b>--find-copies-harder</b>. If <b>n</b> is specified, it has the same meaning
  as for <b>-M&lt;n&gt;</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--find-copies-harder</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">For performance reasons, by default, <b>-C</b> option
  finds copies only if the original file of the copy was modified in the same
  changeset. This flag makes the command inspect unmodified files as candidates
  for the source of copy. This is a very expensive operation for large projects,
  so use it with caution. Giving more than one <b>-C</b> option has the same
  effect.</div>
<p class="Pp">-D, --irreversible-delete</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Omit the preimage for deletes, i.e. print only the header
  but not the diff between the preimage and <b>/dev/null</b>. The resulting
  patch is not meant to be applied with <b>patch</b> or <b>git apply</b>; this
  is solely for people who want to just concentrate on reviewing the text after
  the change. In addition, the output obviously lacks enough information to
  apply such a patch in reverse, even manually, hence the name of the option.
<p class="Pp">When used together with <b>-B</b>, omit also the preimage in the
    deletion part of a delete/create pair.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">-l&lt;num&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The <b>-M</b> and <b>-C</b> options require O(n^2)
  processing time where n is the number of potential rename/copy targets. This
  option prevents rename/copy detection from running if the number of
  rename/copy targets exceeds the specified number.</div>
<p class="Pp">--diff-filter=[(A|C|D|M|R|T|U|X|B)...[*]]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Select only files that are Added (<b>A</b>), Copied
  (<b>C</b>), Deleted (<b>D</b>), Modified (<b>M</b>), Renamed (<b>R</b>), have
  their type (i.e. regular file, symlink, submodule, ...) changed (<b>T</b>),
  are Unmerged (<b>U</b>), are Unknown (<b>X</b>), or have had their pairing
  Broken (<b>B</b>). Any combination of the filter characters (including none)
  can be used. When <b>*</b> (All-or-none) is added to the combination, all
  paths are selected if there is any file that matches other criteria in the
  comparison; if there is no file that matches other criteria, nothing is
  selected.
<p class="Pp">Also, these upper-case letters can be downcased to exclude. E.g.
    <b>--diff-filter=ad</b> excludes added and deleted paths.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that not all diffs can feature all types. For instance, diffs
    from the index to the working tree can never have Added entries (because the
    set of paths included in the diff is limited by what is in the index).
    Similarly, copied and renamed entries cannot appear if detection for those
    types is disabled.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">-S&lt;string&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Look for differences that change the number of
  occurrences of the specified string (i.e. addition/deletion) in a file.
  Intended for the scripter&#x2019;s use.
<p class="Pp">It is useful when you&#x2019;re looking for an exact block of code
    (like a struct), and want to know the history of that block since it first
    came into being: use the feature iteratively to feed the interesting block
    in the preimage back into <b>-S</b>, and keep going until you get the very
    first version of the block.</p>
<p class="Pp">Binary files are searched as well.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">-G&lt;regex&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Look for differences whose patch text contains
  added/removed lines that match &lt;regex&gt;.
<p class="Pp">To illustrate the difference between <b>-S&lt;regex&gt;
    --pickaxe-regex</b> and <b>-G&lt;regex&gt;</b>, consider a commit with the
    following diff in the same file:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
+    return frotz(nitfol, two-&gt;ptr, 1, 0);
...
-    hit = frotz(nitfol, mf2.ptr, 1, 0);
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">While <b>git log -G&quot;frotz\(nitfol&quot;</b> will show this
    commit, <b>git log -S&quot;frotz\(nitfol&quot; --pickaxe-regex</b> will not
    (because the number of occurrences of that string did not change).</p>
<p class="Pp">Unless <b>--text</b> is supplied patches of binary files without a
    textconv filter will be ignored.</p>
<p class="Pp">See the <i>pickaxe</i> entry in <b>gitdiffcore</b>(7) for more
    information.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--find-object=&lt;object-id&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Look for differences that change the number of
  occurrences of the specified object. Similar to <b>-S</b>, just the argument
  is different in that it doesn&#x2019;t search for a specific string but for a
  specific object id.
<p class="Pp">The object can be a blob or a submodule commit. It implies the
    <b>-t</b> option in <b>git-log</b> to also find trees.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--pickaxe-all</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When <b>-S</b> or <b>-G</b> finds a change, show all the
  changes in that changeset, not just the files that contain the change in
  &lt;string&gt;.</div>
<p class="Pp">--pickaxe-regex</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Treat the &lt;string&gt; given to <b>-S</b> as an
  extended POSIX regular expression to match.</div>
<p class="Pp">-O&lt;orderfile&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Control the order in which files appear in the output.
  This overrides the <b>diff.orderFile</b> configuration variable (see
  <b>git-config</b>(1)). To cancel <b>diff.orderFile</b>, use
  <b>-O/dev/null</b>.
<p class="Pp">The output order is determined by the order of glob patterns in
    &lt;orderfile&gt;. All files with pathnames that match the first pattern are
    output first, all files with pathnames that match the second pattern (but
    not the first) are output next, and so on. All files with pathnames that do
    not match any pattern are output last, as if there was an implicit match-all
    pattern at the end of the file. If multiple pathnames have the same rank
    (they match the same pattern but no earlier patterns), their output order
    relative to each other is the normal order.</p>
<p class="Pp">&lt;orderfile&gt; is parsed as follows:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Blank lines are ignored, so they can be used as
  separators for readability.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Lines starting with a hash (&quot;<b>#</b>&quot;)
  are ignored, so they can be used for comments. Add a backslash
  (&quot;<b>\</b>&quot;) to the beginning of the pattern if it starts with a
  hash.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Each other line contains a single pattern.</div>
<p class="Pp">Patterns have the same syntax and semantics as patterns used for
    fnmatch(3) without the FNM_PATHNAME flag, except a pathname also matches a
    pattern if removing any number of the final pathname components matches the
    pattern. For example, the pattern &quot;<b>foo*bar</b>&quot; matches
    &quot;<b>fooasdfbar</b>&quot; and &quot;<b>foo/bar/baz/asdf</b>&quot; but
    not &quot;<b>foobarx</b>&quot;.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--skip-to=&lt;file&gt;, --rotate-to=&lt;file&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Discard the files before the named &lt;file&gt; from the
  output (i.e. <i>skip to</i>), or move them to the end of the output (i.e.
  <i>rotate to</i>). These were invented primarily for use of the <b>git
  difftool</b> command, and may not be very useful otherwise.</div>
<p class="Pp">-R</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Swap two inputs; that is, show differences from index or
  on-disk file to tree contents.</div>
<p class="Pp">--relative[=&lt;path&gt;], --no-relative</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When run from a subdirectory of the project, it can be
  told to exclude changes outside the directory and show pathnames relative to
  it with this option. When you are not in a subdirectory (e.g. in a bare
  repository), you can name which subdirectory to make the output relative to by
  giving a &lt;path&gt; as an argument. <b>--no-relative</b> can be used to
  countermand both <b>diff.relative</b> config option and previous
  <b>--relative</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">-a, --text</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Treat all files as text.</div>
<p class="Pp">--ignore-cr-at-eol</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Ignore carriage-return at the end of line when doing a
  comparison.</div>
<p class="Pp">--ignore-space-at-eol</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Ignore changes in whitespace at EOL.</div>
<p class="Pp">-b, --ignore-space-change</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Ignore changes in amount of whitespace. This ignores
  whitespace at line end, and considers all other sequences of one or more
  whitespace characters to be equivalent.</div>
<p class="Pp">-w, --ignore-all-space</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Ignore whitespace when comparing lines. This ignores
  differences even if one line has whitespace where the other line has
  none.</div>
<p class="Pp">--ignore-blank-lines</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Ignore changes whose lines are all blank.</div>
<p class="Pp">-I&lt;regex&gt;, --ignore-matching-lines=&lt;regex&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Ignore changes whose all lines match &lt;regex&gt;. This
  option may be specified more than once.</div>
<p class="Pp">--inter-hunk-context=&lt;lines&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show the context between diff hunks, up to the specified
  number of lines, thereby fusing hunks that are close to each other. Defaults
  to <b>diff.interHunkContext</b> or 0 if the config option is unset.</div>
<p class="Pp">-W, --function-context</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show whole function as context lines for each change. The
  function names are determined in the same way as <b>git diff</b> works out
  patch hunk headers (see <i>Defining a custom hunk-header</i> in
  <b>gitattributes</b>(5)).</div>
<p class="Pp">--exit-code</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Make the program exit with codes similar to diff(1). That
  is, it exits with 1 if there were differences and 0 means no
  differences.</div>
<p class="Pp">--quiet</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Disable all output of the program. Implies
  <b>--exit-code</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--ext-diff</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Allow an external diff helper to be executed. If you set
  an external diff driver with <b>gitattributes</b>(5), you need to use this
  option with <b>git-log</b>(1) and friends.</div>
<p class="Pp">--no-ext-diff</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Disallow external diff drivers.</div>
<p class="Pp">--textconv, --no-textconv</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Allow (or disallow) external text conversion filters to
  be run when comparing binary files. See <b>gitattributes</b>(5) for details.
  Because textconv filters are typically a one-way conversion, the resulting
  diff is suitable for human consumption, but cannot be applied. For this
  reason, textconv filters are enabled by default only for <b>git-diff</b>(1)
  and <b>git-log</b>(1), but not for <b>git-format-patch</b>(1) or diff plumbing
  commands.</div>
<p class="Pp">--ignore-submodules[=&lt;when&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Ignore changes to submodules in the diff generation.
  &lt;when&gt; can be either &quot;none&quot;, &quot;untracked&quot;,
  &quot;dirty&quot; or &quot;all&quot;, which is the default. Using
  &quot;none&quot; will consider the submodule modified when it either contains
  untracked or modified files or its HEAD differs from the commit recorded in
  the superproject and can be used to override any settings of the <i>ignore</i>
  option in <b>git-config</b>(1) or <b>gitmodules</b>(5). When
  &quot;untracked&quot; is used submodules are not considered dirty when they
  only contain untracked content (but they are still scanned for modified
  content). Using &quot;dirty&quot; ignores all changes to the work tree of
  submodules, only changes to the commits stored in the superproject are shown
  (this was the behavior until 1.7.0). Using &quot;all&quot; hides all changes
  to submodules.</div>
<p class="Pp">--src-prefix=&lt;prefix&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show the given source prefix instead of
  &quot;a/&quot;.</div>

<div class="Bd-indent">Show the given destination prefix instead of
  &quot;b/&quot;.</div>

<div class="Bd-indent">Do not show any source or destination prefix.</div>
<p class="Pp">--line-prefix=&lt;prefix&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Prepend an additional prefix to every line of
  output.</div>
<p class="Pp">--ita-invisible-in-index</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">By default entries added by &quot;git add -N&quot; appear
  as an existing empty file in &quot;git diff&quot; and a new file in &quot;git
  diff --cached&quot;. This option makes the entry appear as a new file in
  &quot;git diff&quot; and non-existent in &quot;git diff --cached&quot;. This
  option could be reverted with <b>--ita-visible-in-index</b>. Both options are
  experimental and could be removed in future.</div>
<p class="Pp">For more detailed explanation on these common options, see also

<p class="Pp">-1 --base, -2 --ours, -3 --theirs</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Compare the working tree with the &quot;base&quot;
  version (stage #1), &quot;our branch&quot; (stage #2) or &quot;their
  branch&quot; (stage #3). The index contains these stages only for unmerged

  PATCH TEXT WITH -P</a></h1>
Running <b>git-diff</b>(1), <b>git-log</b>(1), <b>git-show</b>(1),
  <b>git-diff-index</b>(1), <b>git-diff-tree</b>(1), or <b>git-diff-files</b>(1)
  with the <b>-p</b> option produces patch text. You can customize the creation
  of patch text via the <b>GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF</b> and the <b>GIT_DIFF_OPTS</b>
  environment variables (see <b>git</b>(1)), and the <b>diff</b> attribute (see
  <b>gitattributes</b>(5)).
<p class="Pp">What the -p option produces is slightly different from the
    traditional diff format:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 1.It is preceded with a &quot;git diff&quot; header that
  looks like this:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
diff --git a/file1 b/file2
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The <b>a/</b> and <b>b/</b> filenames are the same unless
    rename/copy is involved. Especially, even for a creation or a deletion,
    <b>/dev/null</b> is <i>not</i> used in place of the <b>a/</b> or <b>b/</b>
    filenames.</p>
<p class="Pp">When rename/copy is involved, <b>file1</b> and <b>file2</b> show
    the name of the source file of the rename/copy and the name of the file that
    rename/copy produces, respectively.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 2.It is followed by one or more extended header lines:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
old mode &lt;mode&gt;
new mode &lt;mode&gt;
deleted file mode &lt;mode&gt;
new file mode &lt;mode&gt;
copy from &lt;path&gt;
copy to &lt;path&gt;
rename from &lt;path&gt;
rename to &lt;path&gt;
similarity index &lt;number&gt;
dissimilarity index &lt;number&gt;
index &lt;hash&gt;..&lt;hash&gt; &lt;mode&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">File modes are printed as 6-digit octal numbers including the file
    type and file permission bits.</p>
<p class="Pp">Path names in extended headers do not include the <b>a/</b> and
    <b>b/</b> prefixes.</p>
<p class="Pp">The similarity index is the percentage of unchanged lines, and the
    dissimilarity index is the percentage of changed lines. It is a rounded down
    integer, followed by a percent sign. The similarity index value of 100% is
    thus reserved for two equal files, while 100% dissimilarity means that no
    line from the old file made it into the new one.</p>
<p class="Pp">The index line includes the blob object names before and after the
    change. The &lt;mode&gt; is included if the file mode does not change;
    otherwise, separate lines indicate the old and the new mode.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 3.Pathnames with &quot;unusual&quot; characters are
  quoted as explained for the configuration variable <b>core.quotePath</b> (see
  <b>git-config</b>(1)).</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 4.All the <b>file1</b> files in the output refer to
  files before the commit, and all the <b>file2</b> files refer to files after
  the commit. It is incorrect to apply each change to each file sequentially.
  For example, this patch will swap a and b:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
diff --git a/a b/b
rename from a
rename to b
diff --git a/b b/a
rename from b
rename to a
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 5.Hunk headers mention the name of the function to which
  the hunk applies. See &quot;Defining a custom hunk-header&quot; in
  <b>gitattributes</b>(5) for details of how to tailor to this to specific
  languages.</div>

<h1 class="Sh" id="COMBINED_DIFF_FORMAT"><a class="permalink" href="#COMBINED_DIFF_FORMAT">COMBINED
  DIFF FORMAT</a></h1>
Any diff-generating command can take the <b>-c</b> or <b>--cc</b> option to
  produce a <i>combined diff</i> when showing a merge. This is the default
  format when showing merges with <b>git-diff</b>(1) or <b>git-show</b>(1). Note
  also that you can give suitable <b>--diff-merges</b> option to any of these
  commands to force generation of diffs in specific format.
<p class="Pp">A &quot;combined diff&quot; format looks like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
diff --combined describe.c

</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 1.It is preceded with a &quot;git diff&quot; header,
  that looks like this (when the <b>-c</b> option is used):
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
diff --combined file
</pre>

<p class="Pp">or like this (when the <b>--cc</b> option is used):</p>

<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
diff --cc file
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 2.It is followed by one or more extended header lines
  (this example shows a merge with two parents):
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
index &lt;hash&gt;,&lt;hash&gt;..&lt;hash&gt;
mode &lt;mode&gt;,&lt;mode&gt;..&lt;mode&gt;
new file mode &lt;mode&gt;
deleted file mode &lt;mode&gt;,&lt;mode&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The <b>mode &lt;mode&gt;,&lt;mode&gt;..&lt;mode&gt;</b> line
    appears only if at least one of the &lt;mode&gt; is different from the rest.
    Extended headers with information about detected contents movement (renames
    and copying detection) are designed to work with diff of two
    &lt;tree-ish&gt; and are not used by combined diff format.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 3.It is followed by two-line from-file/to-file header
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
--- a/file
+++ b/file
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Similar to two-line header for traditional <i>unified</i> diff
    format, <b>/dev/null</b> is used to signal created or deleted files.</p>
<p class="Pp">However, if the --combined-all-paths option is provided, instead
    of a two-line from-file/to-file you get a N+1 line from-file/to-file header,
    where N is the number of parents in the merge commit</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
--- a/file
--- a/file
--- a/file
+++ b/file
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">This extended format can be useful if rename or copy detection is
    active, to allow you to see the original name of the file in different
    parents.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 4.Chunk header format is modified to prevent people from
  accidentally feeding it to <b>patch -p1</b>. Combined diff format was created
  for review of merge commit changes, and was not meant to be applied. The
  change is similar to the change in the extended <i>index</i> header:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
@@@ &lt;from-file-range&gt; &lt;from-file-range&gt; &lt;to-file-range&gt; @@@
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">There are (number of parents + 1) <b>@</b> characters in the chunk
    header for combined diff format.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Unlike the traditional <i>unified</i> diff format, which shows two
    files A and B with a single column that has <b>-</b> (minus &#x2014; appears
    in A but removed in B), <b>+</b> (plus &#x2014; missing in A but added to
    B), or <b>&quot; &quot;</b> (space &#x2014; unchanged) prefix, this format
    compares two or more files file1, file2,... with one file X, and shows how X
    differs from each of fileN. One column for each of fileN is prepended to the
    output line to note how X&#x2019;s line is different from it.</p>
<p class="Pp">A <b>-</b> character in the column N means that the line appears
    in fileN but it does not appear in the result. A <b>+</b> character in the
    column N means that the line appears in the result, and fileN does not have
    that line (in other words, the line was added, from the point of view of
    that parent).</p>
<p class="Pp">In the above example output, the function signature was changed
    from both files (hence two <b>-</b> removals from both file1 and file2, plus
    <b>++</b> to mean one line that was added does not appear in either file1 or
    file2). Also eight other lines are the same from file1 but do not appear in
    file2 (hence prefixed with <b>+</b>).</p>
<p class="Pp">When shown by <b>git diff-tree -c</b>, it compares the parents of
    a merge commit with the merge result (i.e. file1..fileN are the parents).
    When shown by <b>git diff-files -c</b>, it compares the two unresolved merge
    parents with the working tree file (i.e. file1 is stage 2 aka &quot;our
    version&quot;, file2 is stage 3 aka &quot;their version&quot;).</p>

The <b>--summary</b> option describes newly added, deleted, renamed and copied
  files. The <b>--stat</b> option adds diffstat(1) graph to the output. These
  options can be combined with other options, such as <b>-p</b>, and are meant
  for human consumption.
<p class="Pp">When showing a change that involves a rename or a copy,
    <b>--stat</b> output formats the pathnames compactly by combining common
    prefix and suffix of the pathnames. For example, a change that moves
    <b>arch/i386/Makefile</b> to <b>arch/x86/Makefile</b> while modifying 4
    lines will be shown like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
arch/{i386 =&gt; x86}/Makefile    |   4 +--
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>--numstat</b> option gives the diffstat(1) information but
    is designed for easier machine consumption. An entry in <b>--numstat</b>
    output looks like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
1       2       README
3       1       arch/{i386 =&gt; x86}/Makefile

<div class="Bd-indent"> 5.pathname (possibly with rename/copy
  information);</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 6.a newline.</div>
<p class="Pp">When <b>-z</b> output option is in effect, the output is formatted
    this way:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
1       2       README NUL
3       1       NUL arch/i386/Makefile NUL arch/x86/Makefile NUL
</pre>

<div class="Bd-indent"> 5.a NUL (only exists if renamed/copied);</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 6.pathname in preimage;</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 7.a NUL (only exists if renamed/copied);</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 8.pathname in postimage (only exists if
  renamed/copied);</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 9.a NUL.</div>
<p class="Pp">The extra <b>NUL</b> before the preimage path in renamed case is
    to allow scripts that read the output to tell if the current record being
    read is a single-path record or a rename/copy record without reading ahead.
    After reading added and deleted lines, reading up to <b>NUL</b> would yield
    the pathname, but if that is <b>NUL</b>, the record will show two paths.</p>
