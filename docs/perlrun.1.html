<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
The normal way to run a Perl program is by making it directly executable, or
  else by passing the name of the source file as an argument on the command
  line. (An interactive Perl environment is also possible--see perldebug for
  details on how to do that.) Upon startup, Perl looks for your program in one
  of the following places:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>1.</dt>
  <dd>Specified line by line via <b>-e</b> or <b>-E</b> switches on the command
      line.</dd>
  <dt>2.</dt>
  <dd>Contained in the file specified by the first filename on the command line.
      (Note that systems supporting the <span class="Li">&quot;#!&quot;</span>
      notation invoke interpreters this way. See &quot;Location of
    Perl&quot;.)</dd>
  <dt>3.</dt>
  <dd>Passed in implicitly via standard input. This works only if there are no
      filename arguments--to pass arguments to a STDIN-read program you must
      explicitly specify a &quot;-&quot; for the program name.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">With methods 2 and 3, Perl starts parsing the input file from the
    beginning, unless you've specified a <b>-x</b> switch, in which case it
    scans for the first line starting with
    <span class="Li">&quot;#!&quot;</span> and containing the word
    &quot;perl&quot;, and starts there instead. This is useful for running a
    program embedded in a larger message. (In this case you would indicate the
    end of the program using the <span class="Li">&quot;__END__&quot;</span>
    token.)</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;#!&quot;</span> line is always examined
    for switches as the line is being parsed. Thus, if you're on a machine that
    allows only one argument with the <span class="Li">&quot;#!&quot;</span>
    line, or worse, doesn't even recognize the
    <span class="Li">&quot;#!&quot;</span> line, you still can get consistent
    switch behaviour regardless of how Perl was invoked, even if <b>-x</b> was
    used to find the beginning of the program.</p>
<p class="Pp">Because historically some operating systems silently chopped off
    kernel interpretation of the <span class="Li">&quot;#!&quot;</span> line
    after 32 characters, some switches may be passed in on the command line, and
    some may not; you could even get a &quot;-&quot; without its letter, if
    you're not careful. You probably want to make sure that all your switches
    fall either before or after that 32-character boundary. Most switches don't
    actually care if they're processed redundantly, but getting a &quot;-&quot;
    instead of a complete switch could cause Perl to try to execute standard
    input instead of your program. And a partial <b>-I</b> switch could also
    cause odd results.</p>
<p class="Pp">Some switches do care if they are processed twice, for instance
    combinations of <b>-l</b> and <b>-0</b>. Either put all the switches after
    the 32-character boundary (if applicable), or replace the use of
    <b>-0</b><i>digits</i> by <span class="Li">&quot;BEGIN{ $/ =
    &quot;\0digits&quot;; }&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Parsing of the <span class="Li">&quot;#!&quot;</span> switches
    starts wherever &quot;perl&quot; is mentioned in the line. The sequences
    &quot;-*&quot; and &quot;- &quot; are specifically ignored so that you
    could, if you were so inclined, say</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    #!/bin/sh
    #! -*-perl-*-
    eval 'exec perl -x -wS $0 ${1+&quot;$@&quot;}'
        if 0;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">to let Perl see the <b>-p</b> switch.</p>
<p class="Pp">A similar trick involves the <i>env</i> program, if you have
  it.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    #!/usr/bin/env perl
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The examples above use a relative path to the perl interpreter,
    getting whatever version is first in the user's path. If you want a specific
    version of Perl, say, perl5.14.1, you should place that directly in the
    <span class="Li">&quot;#!&quot;</span> line's path.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the <span class="Li">&quot;#!&quot;</span> line does not
    contain the word &quot;perl&quot; nor the word &quot;indir&quot;, the
    program named after the <span class="Li">&quot;#!&quot;</span> is executed
    instead of the Perl interpreter. This is slightly bizarre, but it helps
    people on machines that don't do <span class="Li">&quot;#!&quot;</span>,
    because they can tell a program that their SHELL is <i>/usr/bin/perl</i>,
    and Perl will then dispatch the program to the correct interpreter for
  them.</p>
<p class="Pp">After locating your program, Perl compiles the entire program to
    an internal form. If there are any compilation errors, execution of the
    program is not attempted. (This is unlike the typical shell script, which
    might run part-way through before finding a syntax error.)</p>
<p class="Pp">If the program is syntactically correct, it is executed. If the
    program runs off the end without hitting an <b>exit()</b> or <b>die()</b>
    operator, an implicit <span class="Li">exit(0)</span> is provided to
    indicate successful completion.</p>

  and quoting on non-Unix systems</a></h2>
Unix's <span class="Li">&quot;#!&quot;</span> technique can be simulated on
  other systems:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>OS/2</dt>
  <dd>Put
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    extproc perl -S -your_switches
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">as the first line in <span class="Li">&quot;*.cmd&quot;</span>
        file (<b>-S</b> due to a bug in cmd.exe's `extproc' handling).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>MS-DOS</dt>
  <dd>Create a batch file to run your program, and codify it in
      <span class="Li">&quot;ALTERNATE_SHEBANG&quot;</span> (see the
      <i>dosish.h</i> file in the source distribution for more
    information).</dd>
  <dt>Win95/NT</dt>
  <dd>The Win95/NT installation, when using the ActiveState installer for Perl,
      will modify the Registry to associate the <i>.pl</i> extension with the
      perl interpreter. If you install Perl by other means (including building
      from the sources), you may have to modify the Registry yourself. Note that
      this means you can no longer tell the difference between an executable
      Perl program and a Perl library file.</dd>
  <dt>VMS</dt>
  <dd>Put
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
 $ perl -mysw 'f$env(&quot;procedure&quot;)' 'p1' 'p2' 'p3' 'p4' 'p5' 'p6' 'p7' 'p8' !
 $ exit++ + ++$status != 0 and $exit = $status = undef;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">at the top of your program, where <b>-mysw</b> are any command
        line switches you want to pass to Perl. You can now invoke the program
        directly, by saying <span class="Li">&quot;perl program&quot;</span>, or
        as a DCL procedure, by saying <span class="Li">@program</span> (or
        implicitly via <i>DCL$PATH</i> by just using the name of the
      program).</p>
    <p class="Pp">This incantation is a bit much to remember, but Perl will
        display it for you if you say <span class="Li">&quot;perl
        &quot;-V:startperl&quot;&quot;</span>.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Command-interpreters on non-Unix systems have rather different
    ideas on quoting than Unix shells. You'll need to learn the special
    characters in your command-interpreter
    (<span class="Li">&quot;*&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;\&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;&quot;&quot;</span> are common) and how to protect
    whitespace and these characters to run one-liners (see -e below).</p>
<p class="Pp">On some systems, you may have to change single-quotes to double
    ones, which you must <i>not</i> do on Unix or Plan 9 systems. You might also
    have to change a single % to a %%.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    # Unix
    perl -e 'print &quot;Hello world\n&quot;'

    # MS-DOS, etc.
    perl -e &quot;print \&quot;Hello world\n\&quot;&quot;

    # VMS
    perl -e &quot;print &quot;&quot;Hello world\n&quot;&quot;&quot;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The problem is that none of this is reliable: it depends on the
    command and it is entirely possible neither works. If <i>4DOS</i> were the
    command shell, this would probably work better:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    perl -e &quot;print &lt;Ctrl-x&gt;&quot;Hello world\n&lt;Ctrl-x&gt;&quot;&quot;
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><b>CMD.EXE</b> in Windows NT slipped a lot of standard Unix
    functionality in when nobody was looking, but just try to find documentation
    for its quoting rules.</p>
<p class="Pp">There is no general solution to all of this. It's just a mess.</p>

It may seem obvious to say, but Perl is useful only when users can easily find
  it. When possible, it's good for both <i>/usr/bin/perl</i> and
  <i>/usr/local/bin/perl</i> to be symlinks to the actual binary. If that can't
  be done, system administrators are strongly encouraged to put (symlinks to)
  perl and its accompanying utilities into a directory typically found along a
  user's PATH, or in some other obvious and convenient place.
<p class="Pp">In this documentation,
    <span class="Li">&quot;#!/usr/bin/perl&quot;</span> on the first line of the
    program will stand in for whatever method works on your system. You are
    advised to use a specific path if you care about a specific version.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    #!/usr/local/bin/perl5.14
</pre>
<p class="Pp">or if you just want to be running at least version, place a
    statement like this at the top of your program:</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Command_Switches"><a class="permalink" href="#Command_Switches">Command
  Switches</a></h2>
As with all standard commands, a single-character switch may be clustered with
  the following switch, if any.
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    #!/usr/bin/perl -spi.orig   # same as -s -p -i.orig
</pre>
<p class="Pp">A <span class="Li">&quot;--&quot;</span> signals the end of
    options and disables further option processing. Any arguments after the
    <span class="Li">&quot;--&quot;</span> are treated as filenames and
    arguments.</p>
<p class="Pp">Switches include:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>-0</b>[<i>octal/hexadecimal</i>]</dt>
  <dd>specifies the input record separator (<span class="Li">$/</span>) as an
      octal or hexadecimal number. If there are no digits, the null character is
      the separator. Other switches may precede or follow the digits. For
      example, if you have a version of <i>find</i> which can print filenames
      terminated by the null character, you can say this:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    find . -name '*.orig' -print0 | perl -n0e unlink
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The special value 00 will cause Perl to slurp files in
        paragraph mode. Any value 0400 or above will cause Perl to slurp files
        whole, but by convention the value 0777 is the one normally used for
        this purpose.</p>
    <p class="Pp">You can also specify the separator character using hexadecimal
        notation: <b>-0x</b><b><i>HHH...</i></b><b></b>, where the
        <span class="Li">&quot;</span><i>H</i><span class="Li">&quot;</span> are
        valid hexadecimal digits. Unlike the octal form, this one may be used to
        specify any Unicode character, even those beyond 0xFF. So if you
        <i>really</i> want a record separator of 0777, specify it as
        <b>-0x1FF</b>. (This means that you cannot use the <b>-x</b> option with
        a directory name that consists of hexadecimal digits, or else Perl will
        think you have specified a hex number to <b>-0</b>.)</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>-a</b></dt>
  <dd>turns on autosplit mode when used with a <b>-n</b> or <b>-p</b>. An
      implicit split command to the <span class="Li">@F</span> array is done as
      the first thing inside the implicit while loop produced by the <b>-n</b>
      or <b>-p</b>.
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    perl -ane 'print pop(@F), &quot;\n&quot;;'

    I     1   STDIN is assumed to be in UTF-8

    S     7   I + O + E
    i     8   UTF-8 is the default PerlIO layer for input streams
    o    16   UTF-8 is the default PerlIO layer for output streams
    D    24   i + o
    A    32   the @ARGV elements are expected to be strings encoded
              in UTF-8
    L    64   normally the &quot;IOEioA&quot; are unconditional, the L makes
              them conditional on the locale environment variables
              (the LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, and LANG, in the order of
              decreasing precedence) -- if the variables indicate
              UTF-8, then the selected &quot;IOEioA&quot; are in effect
    a   256   Set ${^UTF8CACHE} to -1, to run the UTF-8 caching
              code in debugging mode.
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">For example, <b>-COE</b> and <b>-C6</b> will both turn on
        UTF-8-ness on both STDOUT and STDERR. Repeating letters is just
        redundant, not cumulative nor toggling.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;io&quot;</span> options mean that
        any subsequent <b>open()</b> (or similar I/O operations) in the current
        file scope will have the <span class="Li">&quot;:utf8&quot;</span>
        PerlIO layer implicitly applied to them, in other words, UTF-8 is
        expected from any input stream, and UTF-8 is produced to any output
        stream. This is just the default, with explicit layers in <b>open()</b>
        and with <b>binmode()</b> one can manipulate streams as usual.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><b>-C</b> on its own (not followed by any number or option
        list), or the empty string <span class="Li">&quot;&quot;</span> for the
        <span class="Li">&quot;PERL_UNICODE&quot;</span> environment variable,
        has the same effect as <b>-CSDL</b>. In other words, the standard I/O
        handles and the default <span class="Li">&quot;open()&quot;</span> layer
        are UTF-8-fied <i>but</i> only if the locale environment variables
        indicate a UTF-8 locale. This behaviour follows the <i>implicit</i> (and
        problematic) UTF-8 behaviour of Perl 5.8.0. (See &quot;UTF-8 no longer
        default under UTF-8 locales&quot; in perl581delta.)</p>
    <p class="Pp">You can use <b>-C0</b> (or
        <span class="Li">&quot;0&quot;</span> for
        <span class="Li">&quot;PERL_UNICODE&quot;</span>) to explicitly disable
        all the above Unicode features.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The read-only magic variable
        <span class="Li">&quot;${^UNICODE}&quot;</span> reflects the numeric
        value of this setting. This variable is set during Perl startup and is
        thereafter read-only. If you want runtime effects, use the three-arg
        <b>open()</b> (see &quot;open&quot; in perlfunc), the two-arg
        <b>binmode()</b> (see &quot;binmode&quot; in perlfunc), and the
        <span class="Li">&quot;open&quot;</span> pragma (see open).</p>
    <p class="Pp">(In Perls earlier than 5.8.1 the <b>-C</b> switch was a
        Win32-only switch that enabled the use of Unicode-aware &quot;wide
        system call&quot; Win32 APIs. This feature was practically unused,
        however, and the command line switch was therefore
        &quot;recycled&quot;.)</p>
    <p class="Pp"><b>Note:</b> Since perl 5.10.1, if the <b>-C</b> option is
        used on the <span class="Li">&quot;#!&quot;</span> line, it must be
        specified on the command line as well, since the standard streams are
        already set up at this point in the execution of the perl interpreter.
        You can also use <b>binmode()</b> to set the encoding of an I/O
      stream.</p>

    <p class="Pp">Perl can be built so that it by default will try to execute
        <i></i><i>$Config</i><i>{sitelib}/sitecustomize.pl</i> at startup (in a
        BEGIN block). This is a hook that allows the sysadmin to customize how
        Perl behaves. It can for instance be used to add entries to the
        <span class="Li">@INC</span> array to make Perl find modules in
        non-standard locations.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Perl actually inserts the following code:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    BEGIN {
        do { local $!; -f &quot;$Config{sitelib}/sitecustomize.pl&quot;; }
            &amp;&amp; do &quot;$Config{sitelib}/sitecustomize.pl&quot;;
    }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Since it is an actual <span class="Li">&quot;do&quot;</span>
        (not a <span class="Li">&quot;require&quot;</span>),
        <i>sitecustomize.pl</i> doesn't need to return a true value. The code is
        run in package <span class="Li">&quot;main&quot;</span>, in its own
        lexical scope. However, if the script dies, <span class="Li">$@</span>
        will not be set.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The value of <span class="Li">$Config{sitelib}</span> is also
        determined in C code and not read from
        <span class="Li">&quot;Config.pm&quot;</span>, which is not loaded.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The code is executed <i>very</i> early. For example, any

        will be likewise executed very late.</p>
    <p class="Pp">To determine at runtime if this capability has been compiled

      otherwise it will be put in single quotes. You can't use literal
      whitespace or NUL characters in the pattern.
    <p class="Pp"><b>-F</b> implicitly sets both <b>-a</b> and <b>-n</b>.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt><b>-i</b>[<i>extension</i>]</dt>
  <dd>specifies that files processed by the
      <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;&gt;&quot;</span> construct are to be edited
      in-place. It does this by renaming the input file, opening the output file
      by the original name, and selecting that output file as the default for
      <b>print()</b> statements. The extension, if supplied, is used to modify
      the name of the old file to make a backup copy, following these rules:
    <p class="Pp">If no extension is supplied, and your system supports it, the
        original <i>file</i> is kept open without a name while the output is
        redirected to a new file with the original <i>filename</i>. When perl
        exits, cleanly or not, the original <i>file</i> is unlinked.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If the extension doesn't contain a
        <span class="Li">&quot;*&quot;</span>, then it is appended to the end of
        the current filename as a suffix. If the extension does contain one or
        more <span class="Li">&quot;*&quot;</span> characters, then each
        <span class="Li">&quot;*&quot;</span> is replaced with the current
        filename. In Perl terms, you could think of this as:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    ($backup = $extension) =~ s/\*/$file_name/g;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This allows you to add a prefix to the backup file, instead of
        (or in addition to) a suffix:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
 $ perl -pi'orig_*' -e 's/bar/baz/' fileA  # backup to
                                           # 'orig_fileA'
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Or even to place backup copies of the original files into
        another directory (provided the directory already exists):</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
 $ perl -pi'old/*.orig' -e 's/bar/baz/' fileA  # backup to
                                               # 'old/fileA.orig'
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">These sets of one-liners are equivalent:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
 $ perl -pi -e 's/bar/baz/' fileA          # overwrite current file
 $ perl -pi'*' -e 's/bar/baz/' fileA       # overwrite current file

 $ perl -pi'.orig' -e 's/bar/baz/' fileA   # backup to 'fileA.orig'
 $ perl -pi'*.orig' -e 's/bar/baz/' fileA  # backup to 'fileA.orig'
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">From the shell, saying</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    $ perl -p -i.orig -e &quot;s/foo/bar/; ... &quot;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">is the same as using the program:</p>

                $backup = $ARGV . $extension;
            }
            else {
                ($backup = $extension) =~ s/\*/$ARGV/g;

        s/foo/bar/;
    }
    continue {
        print;  # this prints to original filename
    }
    select(STDOUT);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">except that the <b>-i</b> form doesn't need to compare
        <span class="Li">$ARGV</span> to <span class="Li">$oldargv</span> to
        know when the filename has changed. It does, however, use ARGVOUT for
        the selected filehandle. Note that STDOUT is restored as the default
        output filehandle after the loop.</p>
    <p class="Pp">As shown above, Perl creates the backup file whether or not
        any output is actually changed. So this is just a fancy way to copy
        files:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    $ perl -p -i'/some/file/path/*' -e 1 file1 file2 file3...
or
    $ perl -p -i'.orig' -e 1 file1 file2 file3...
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">You can use <span class="Li">&quot;eof&quot;</span> without
        parentheses to locate the end of each input file, in case you want to
        append to each file, or reset line numbering (see example in
        &quot;eof&quot; in perlfunc).</p>
    <p class="Pp">If, for a given file, Perl is unable to create the backup file
        as specified in the extension then it will skip that file and continue
        on with the next one (if it exists).</p>
    <p class="Pp">For a discussion of issues surrounding file permissions and
        <b>-i</b>, see &quot;Why does Perl let me delete read-only files? Why
        does -i clobber protected files? Isn't this a bug in Perl?&quot; in
        perlfaq5.</p>
    <p class="Pp">You cannot use <b>-i</b> to create directories or to strip
        extensions from files.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Perl does not expand <span class="Li">&quot;~&quot;</span> in
        filenames, which is good, since some folks use it for their backup
        files:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    $ perl -pi~ -e 's/foo/bar/' file1 file2 file3...
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Note that because <b>-i</b> renames or deletes the original
        file before creating a new file of the same name, Unix-style soft and
        hard links will not be preserved.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Finally, the <b>-i</b> switch does not impede execution when
        no files are given on the command line. In this case, no backup is made
        (the original file cannot, of course, be determined) and processing
        proceeds from STDIN to STDOUT as might be expected.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>-I</b><i>directory</i></dt>
  <dd>Directories specified by <b>-I</b> are prepended to the search path for
      modules (<span class="Li">@INC</span>).</dd>
  <dt><b>-l</b>[<i>octnum</i>]</dt>
  <dd>enables automatic line-ending processing. It has two separate effects.
      First, it automatically chomps <span class="Li">$/</span> (the input
      record separator) when used with <b>-n</b> or <b>-p</b>. Second, it
      assigns <span class="Li">&quot;$\&quot;</span> (the output record
      separator) to have the value of <i>octnum</i> so that any print statements
      will have that separator added back on. If <i>octnum</i> is omitted, sets
      <span class="Li">&quot;$\&quot;</span> to the current value of
      <span class="Li">$/</span>. For instance, to trim lines to 80 columns:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    perl -lpe 'substr($_, 80) = &quot;&quot;'
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Note that the assignment <span class="Li">&quot;$\ =
        $/&quot;</span> is done when the switch is processed, so the input
        record separator can be different than the output record separator if
        the <b>-l</b> switch is followed by a <b>-0</b> switch:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    gnufind / -print0 | perl -ln0e 'print &quot;found $_&quot; if -p'
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This sets <span class="Li">&quot;$\&quot;</span> to newline
        and then sets <span class="Li">$/</span> to the null character.</p>

    <p class="Pp"><b>-M</b><i>module</i> executes

        This loads the module and calls its
        <span class="Li">&quot;import&quot;</span> method, causing the module to
        have its default effect, typically importing subroutines or giving
        effect to a pragma. You can use quotes to add extra code after the
        module name, e.g.,
        <span class="Li">'-M</span><i>MODULE</i><span class="Li"> qw(foo
        bar)'</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If the first character after the <b>-M</b> or <b>-m</b> is a
        dash (<b>-</b>) then the 'use' is replaced with 'no'. This makes no
        difference for <b>-m</b>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">A little builtin syntactic sugar means you can also say
        <b>-m</b> <b><i>MODULE</i></b><b>=foo,bar</b> or
        <b>-M</b><b><i>MODULE</i></b> <b>=foo,bar</b> as a shortcut for
        <b>'-M</b> <b><i>MODULE</i></b><b> qw(foo bar)'</b>. This avoids the
        need to use quotes when importing symbols. The actual code generated by
        <b>-M</b><b><i>MODULE</i></b><b>=foo,bar</b> is
        <span class="Li">&quot;use module split(/,/,q{foo,bar})&quot;</span>.
        Note that the <span class="Li">&quot;=&quot;</span> form removes the
        distinction between <b>-m</b> and <b>-M</b>; that is,
        <b>-m</b><b><i>MODULE</i></b><b>=foo,bar</b> is the same as
        <b>-M</b><b><i>MODULE</i></b><b>=foo,bar</b>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">A consequence of the <span class="Li">&quot;split&quot;</span>
        formulation is that <b>-M</b><b><i>MODULE</i></b><b>=number</b> never
        does a version check, unless
        <span class="Li">&quot;</span><i>MODULE</i><span class="Li">::import()&quot;</span>
        itself is set up to do a version check, which could happen for example

  <dd>makes Perl use the PATH environment variable to search for the program
      unless the name of the program contains path separators.
    <p class="Pp">On some platforms, this also makes Perl append suffixes to the
        filename while searching for it. For example, on Win32 platforms, the
        &quot;.bat&quot; and &quot;.cmd&quot; suffixes are appended if a lookup
        for the original name fails, and if the name does not already end in one
        of those suffixes. If your Perl was compiled with
        <span class="Li">&quot;DEBUGGING&quot;</span> turned on, using the
        <b>-Dp</b> switch to Perl shows how the search progresses.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Typically this is used to emulate
        <span class="Li">&quot;#!&quot;</span> startup on platforms that don't
        support <span class="Li">&quot;#!&quot;</span>. It's also convenient
        when debugging a script that uses
        <span class="Li">&quot;#!&quot;</span>, and is thus normally found by
        the shell's <span class="Li">$PATH</span> search mechanism.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This example works on many platforms that have a shell
        compatible with Bourne shell:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    #!/usr/bin/perl
    eval 'exec /usr/bin/perl -wS $0 ${1+&quot;$@&quot;}'
            if $running_under_some_shell;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The system ignores the first line and feeds the program to
        <i>/bin/sh</i>, which proceeds to try to execute the Perl program as a
        shell script. The shell executes the second line as a normal shell
        command, and thus starts up the Perl interpreter. On some systems
        <span class="Li">$0</span> doesn't always contain the full pathname, so
        the <b>-S</b> tells Perl to search for the program if necessary. After
        Perl locates the program, it parses the lines and ignores them because
        the variable <span class="Li">$running_under_some_shell</span> is never
        true. If the program will be interpreted by csh, you will need to
        replace <span class="Li">&quot;${1+&quot;$@&quot;}&quot;</span> with
        <span class="Li">$*</span>, even though that doesn't understand embedded
        spaces (and such) in the argument list. To start up <i>sh</i> rather
        than <i>csh</i>, some systems may have to replace the
        <span class="Li">&quot;#!&quot;</span> line with a line containing just
        a colon, which will be politely ignored by Perl. Other systems can't
        control that, and need a totally devious construct that will work under
        any of <i>csh</i>, <i>sh</i>, or Perl, such as the following:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
        eval '(exit $?0)' &amp;&amp; eval 'exec perl -wS $0 ${1+&quot;$@&quot;}'
        &amp; eval 'exec /usr/bin/perl -wS $0 $argv:q'
                if $running_under_some_shell;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If the filename supplied contains directory separators (and so
        is an absolute or relative pathname), and if that file is not found,
        platforms that append file extensions will do so and try to look for the
        file with those extensions added, one by one.</p>
    <p class="Pp">On DOS-like platforms, if the program does not contain
        directory separators, it will first be searched for in the current
        directory before being searched for on the PATH. On Unix platforms, the
        program will be searched for strictly on the PATH.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>-t</b></dt>
  <dd>Like <b>-T</b>, but taint checks will issue warnings rather than fatal

      <span class="Li">qw(taint)&quot;</span>.
    <p class="Pp"><b>Note: This is not a substitute for

  </dd>
  <dt><b>-T</b></dt>
  <dd>turns on &quot;taint&quot; so you can test them. Ordinarily these checks
      are done only when running setuid or setgid. It's a good idea to turn them
      on explicitly for programs that run on behalf of someone else whom you
      might not necessarily trust, such as CGI programs or any internet servers
      you might write in Perl. See perlsec for details. For security reasons,
      this option must be seen by Perl quite early; usually this means it must
      appear early on the command line or in the
      <span class="Li">&quot;#!&quot;</span> line for systems which support that
      construct.</dd>
  <dt><b>-u</b></dt>
  <dd>This switch causes Perl to dump core after compiling your program. You can
      then in theory take this core dump and turn it into an executable file by
      using the <i>undump</i> program (not supplied). This speeds startup at the
      expense of some disk space (which you can minimize by stripping the
      executable). (Still, a &quot;hello world&quot; executable comes out to
      about 200K on my machine.) If you want to execute a portion of your
      program before dumping, use the <b>dump()</b> operator instead. Note:
      availability of <i>undump</i> is platform specific and may not be
      available for a specific port of Perl.</dd>
  <dt><b>-U</b></dt>
  <dd>allows Perl to do unsafe operations. Currently the only &quot;unsafe&quot;
      operations are attempting to unlink directories while running as superuser
      and running setuid programs with fatal taint checks turned into warnings.
      Note that warnings must be enabled along with this option to actually
      <i>generate</i> the taint-check warnings.</dd>

        You can disable or promote into fatal errors specific warnings using

  <dt><b>-x</b><i>directory</i></dt>
  <dd>tells Perl that the program is embedded in a larger chunk of unrelated
      text, such as in a mail message. Leading garbage will be discarded until
      the first line that starts with <span class="Li">&quot;#!&quot;</span> and
      contains the string &quot;perl&quot;. Any meaningful switches on that line
      will be applied.
    <p class="Pp">All references to line numbers by the program (warnings,
        errors, ...) will treat the <span class="Li">&quot;#!&quot;</span> line
        as the first line. Thus a warning on the 2nd line of the program, which
        is on the 100th line in the file will be reported as line 2, not as line
        100. This can be overridden by using the
        <span class="Li">&quot;#line&quot;</span> directive. (See &quot;Plain
        Old Comments (Not!)&quot; in perlsyn)</p>
    <p class="Pp">If a directory name is specified, Perl will switch to that
        directory before running the program. The <b>-x</b> switch controls only
        the disposal of leading garbage. The program must be terminated with
        <span class="Li">&quot;__END__&quot;</span> if there is trailing garbage
        to be ignored; the program can process any or all of the trailing
        garbage via the <span class="Li">&quot;DATA&quot;</span> filehandle if
        desired.</p>

      <i>version/</i>, or <i>archname/</i> under the specified locations are
      automatically included if they exist, with this lookup done at interpreter

      <span class="Li">$Config{inc_version_list}</span> are added. (These
      typically would be for older compatible perl versions installed in the
      same directory tree.)
    <p class="Pp">If PERL5LIB is not defined, PERLLIB is used. Directories are
        separated (like in PATH) by a colon on Unixish platforms and by a

  <dt>PERLIO</dt>
  <dd>A space (or colon) separated list of PerlIO layers. If perl is built to
      use PerlIO system for IO (the default) these layers affect Perl's IO.
    <p class="Pp">It is conventional to start layer names with a colon (for
        example, <span class="Li">&quot;:perlio&quot;</span>) to emphasize their
        similarity to variable &quot;attributes&quot;. But the code that parses
        layer specification strings, which is also used to decode the PERLIO
        environment variable, treats the colon as a separator.</p>
    <p class="Pp">An unset or empty PERLIO is equivalent to the default set of
        layers for your platform; for example,
        <span class="Li">&quot;:unix:perlio&quot;</span> on Unix-like systems
        and <span class="Li">&quot;:unix:crlf&quot;</span> on Windows and other
        DOS-like systems.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The list becomes the default for <i>all</i> Perl's IO.
        Consequently only built-in layers can appear in this list, as external
        layers (such as <span class="Li">&quot;:encoding()&quot;</span>) need IO
        in order to load them! See &quot;open pragma&quot; for how to add
        external encodings as defaults.</p>

      translation distinguishing &quot;text&quot; and &quot;binary&quot; files
      in the manner of MS-DOS and similar operating systems. (It currently does

  <dd>A layer that implements &quot;reading&quot; of files by using

  <dt>:perlio</dt>
  <dd>This is a re-implementation of stdio-like buffering written as a PerlIO

  <dt>:pop</dt>
  <dd>An experimental pseudolayer that removes the topmost layer. Use with the

  <dt>:raw</dt>
  <dd>A pseudolayer that manipulates other layers. Applying the
      <span class="Li">&quot;:raw&quot;</span> layer is equivalent to calling
      <span class="Li">&quot;binmode($fh)&quot;</span>. It makes the stream pass
      each byte as-is without translation. In particular, both CRLF translation
      and intuiting <span class="Li">&quot;:utf8&quot;</span> from the locale

<p class="Pp">The default set of layers should give acceptable results on all

<p class="Pp">On Win32 the default in this release (5.14) is &quot;unix
    crlf&quot;. Win32's &quot;stdio&quot; has a number of bugs/mis-features for

<p class="Pp">This release (5.14) uses <span class="Li">&quot;unix&quot;</span>

  <dd>Set to 1 to allow the use of non-IFS compatible LSPs (Layered Service
      Providers). Perl normally searches for an IFS-compatible LSP because this
      is required for its emulation of Windows sockets as real filehandles.
      However, this may cause problems if you have a firewall such as <i>McAfee
      Guardian</i>, which requires that all applications use its LSP but which
      is not IFS-compatible, because clearly Perl will normally avoid using such
      an LSP.
    <p class="Pp">Setting this environment variable to 1 means that Perl will
        simply use the first suitable LSP enumerated in the catalog, which keeps
        <i>McAfee Guardian</i> happy--and in that particular case Perl still
        works too because <i>McAfee</i> <i>Guardian</i>'s LSP actually plays
        other games which allow applications requiring IFS compatibility to
        work.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>PERL_DEBUG_MSTATS</dt>
  <dd>Relevant only if Perl is compiled with the
      <span class="Li">&quot;malloc&quot;</span> included with the Perl
      distribution; that is, if <span class="Li">&quot;perl
      -V:d_mymalloc&quot;</span> is &quot;define&quot;.
    <p class="Pp">If set, this dumps out memory statistics after execution. If
        set to an integer greater than one, also dumps out memory statistics
        after compilation.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL</dt>
  <dd>Relevant only if your Perl executable was built with <b>-DDEBUGGING</b>,
      this controls the behaviour of global destruction of objects and other
      references. See &quot;PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL&quot; in perlhacktips for more
      information.</dd>
  <dt>PERL_DL_NONLAZY</dt>
  <dd>Set to <span class="Li">&quot;1&quot;</span> to have Perl resolve
      <i>all</i> undefined symbols when it loads a dynamic library. The default
      behaviour is to resolve symbols when they are used. Setting this variable
      is useful during testing of extensions, as it ensures that you get an
      error on misspelled function names even if the test suite doesn't call
      them.</dd>
  <dt>PERL_ENCODING</dt>
  <dd>If using the <span class="Li">&quot;use encoding&quot;</span> pragma
      without an explicit encoding name, the PERL_ENCODING environment variable
      is consulted for an encoding name.</dd>
  <dt>PERL_HASH_SEED</dt>
  <dd>(Since Perl 5.8.1, new semantics in Perl 5.18.0) Used to override the
      randomization of Perl's internal hash function. The value is expressed in
      hexadecimal, and may include a leading 0x. Truncated patterns are treated
      as though they are suffixed with sufficient 0's as required.
    <p class="Pp">If the option is provided, and
        <span class="Li">&quot;PERL_PERTURB_KEYS&quot;</span> is NOT set, then a
        value of '0' implies
        <span class="Li">&quot;PERL_PERTURB_KEYS=0&quot;</span> and any other
        value implies
      <span class="Li">&quot;PERL_PERTURB_KEYS=2&quot;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><b>PLEASE NOTE: The hash seed is sensitive information</b>.
        Hashes are randomized to protect against local and remote attacks
        against Perl code. By manually setting a seed, this protection may be
        partially or completely lost.</p>
    <p class="Pp">See &quot;Algorithmic Complexity Attacks&quot; in perlsec,
        &quot;PERL_PERTURB_KEYS&quot;, and &quot;PERL_HASH_SEED_DEBUG&quot; for
        more information.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>PERL_PERTURB_KEYS</dt>
  <dd>(Since Perl 5.18.0) Set to <span class="Li">&quot;0&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;NO&quot;</span> then traversing keys will be
      repeatable from run to run for the same PERL_HASH_SEED. Insertion into a
      hash will not change the order, except to provide for more space in the
      hash. When combined with setting PERL_HASH_SEED this mode is as close to
      pre 5.18 behavior as you can get.
    <p class="Pp">When set to <span class="Li">&quot;1&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;RANDOM&quot;</span> then traversing keys will be
        randomized. Every time a hash is inserted into the key order will change
        in a random fashion. The order may not be repeatable in a following
        program run even if the PERL_HASH_SEED has been specified. This is the
        default mode for perl.</p>
    <p class="Pp">When set to <span class="Li">&quot;2&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;DETERMINISTIC&quot;</span> then inserting keys
        into a hash will cause the key order to change, but in a way that is
        repeatable from program run to program run.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><b>NOTE:</b> Use of this option is considered insecure, and is
        intended only for debugging non-deterministic behavior in Perl's hash
        function. Do not use it in production.</p>
    <p class="Pp">See &quot;Algorithmic Complexity Attacks&quot; in perlsec and
        &quot;PERL_HASH_SEED&quot; and &quot;PERL_HASH_SEED_DEBUG&quot; for more
        information. You can get and set the key traversal mask for a specific
        hash by using the
        <span class="Li">&quot;hash_traversal_mask()&quot;</span> function from
        Hash::Util.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>PERL_HASH_SEED_DEBUG</dt>
  <dd>(Since Perl 5.8.1.) Set to <span class="Li">&quot;1&quot;</span> to
      display (to STDERR) information about the hash function, seed, and what
      type of key traversal randomization is in effect at the beginning of
      execution. This, combined with &quot;PERL_HASH_SEED&quot; and
      &quot;PERL_PERTURB_KEYS&quot; is intended to aid in debugging
      nondeterministic behaviour caused by hash randomization.
    <p class="Pp"><b>Note</b> that any information about the hash function,
        especially the hash seed is <b>sensitive information</b>: by knowing it,
        one can craft a denial-of-service attack against Perl code, even
        remotely; see &quot;Algorithmic Complexity Attacks&quot; in perlsec for
        more information. <b>Do not disclose the hash seed</b> to people who
        don't need to know it. See also
        <span class="Li">&quot;hash_seed()&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;key_traversal_mask()&quot;</span> in
      Hash::Util.</p>
    <p class="Pp">An example output might be:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
 HASH_FUNCTION = ONE_AT_A_TIME_HARD HASH_SEED = 0x652e9b9349a7a032 PERTURB_KEYS = 1 (RANDOM)
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>PERL_MEM_LOG</dt>
  <dd>If your Perl was configured with <b>-Accflags=-DPERL_MEM_LOG</b>, setting
      the environment variable <span class="Li">&quot;PERL_MEM_LOG&quot;</span>
      enables logging debug messages. The value has the form
      <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;</span><i>number</i><span class="Li">&gt;[m][s][t]&quot;</span>,
      where
      <span class="Li">&quot;</span><i>number</i><span class="Li">&quot;</span>
      is the file descriptor number you want to write to (2 is default), and the
      combination of letters specifies that you want information about (m)emory
      and/or (s)v, optionally with (t)imestamps. For example,
      <span class="Li">&quot;PERL_MEM_LOG=1mst&quot;</span> logs all information
      to stdout. You can write to other opened file descriptors in a variety of
      ways:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
  $ 3&gt;foo3 PERL_MEM_LOG=3m perl ...
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>PERL_ROOT (specific to the VMS port)</dt>
  <dd>A translation-concealed rooted logical name that contains Perl and the
      logical device for the <span class="Li">@INC</span> path on VMS only.
      Other logical names that affect Perl on VMS include PERLSHR,
      PERL_ENV_TABLES, and SYS$TIMEZONE_DIFFERENTIAL, but are optional and
      discussed further in perlvms and in <i>README.vms</i> in the Perl source
      distribution.</dd>
  <dt>PERL_SIGNALS</dt>
  <dd>Available in Perls 5.8.1 and later. If set to
      <span class="Li">&quot;unsafe&quot;</span>, the pre-Perl-5.8.0 signal
      behaviour (which is immediate but unsafe) is restored. If set to
      <span class="Li">&quot;safe&quot;</span>, then safe (but deferred) signals
      are used. See &quot;Deferred Signals (Safe Signals)&quot; in perlipc.</dd>
  <dt>PERL_UNICODE</dt>
  <dd>Equivalent to the <b>-C</b> command-line switch. Note that this is not a
      boolean variable. Setting this to <span class="Li">&quot;1&quot;</span> is
      not the right way to &quot;enable Unicode&quot; (whatever that would
      mean). You can use <span class="Li">&quot;0&quot;</span> to &quot;disable
      Unicode&quot;, though (or alternatively unset PERL_UNICODE in your shell
      before starting Perl). See the description of the <b>-C</b> switch for
      more information.</dd>
  <dt>PERL_USE_UNSAFE_INC</dt>
  <dd>If perl has been configured to not have the current directory in
      <span class="Li">@INC</span> by default, this variable can be set to
      <span class="Li">&quot;1&quot;</span> to reinstate it. It's primarily
      intended for use while building and testing modules that have not been
      updated to deal with &quot;.&quot; not being in
      <span class="Li">@INC</span> and should not be set in the environment for
      day-to-day use.</dd>
  <dt>SYS$LOGIN (specific to the VMS port)</dt>
  <dd>Used if chdir has no argument and HOME and LOGDIR are not set.</dd>
  <dt>PERL_INTERNAL_RAND_SEED</dt>
  <dd>Set to a non-negative integer to seed the random number generator used
      internally by perl for a variety of purposes.
    <p class="Pp">Ignored if perl is run setuid or setgid. Used only for some
        limited startup randomization (hash keys) if
        <span class="Li">&quot;-T&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;-t&quot;</span> perl is started with tainting
        enabled.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Perl may be built to ignore this variable.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Perl also has environment variables that control how Perl handles
    data specific to particular natural languages; see perllocale.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl and its various modules and components, including its test
    frameworks, may sometimes make use of certain other environment variables.
    Some of these are specific to a particular platform. Please consult the
    appropriate module documentation and any documentation for your platform
    (like perlsolaris, perllinux, perlmacosx, perlwin32, etc) for variables
    peculiar to those specific situations.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl makes all environment variables available to the program
    being executed, and passes these along to any child processes it starts.
    However, programs running setuid would do well to execute the following
    lines before doing anything else, just to keep people honest:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    $ENV{PATH}  = &quot;/bin:/usr/bin&quot;;    # or whatever you need
    $ENV{SHELL} = &quot;/bin/sh&quot; if exists $ENV{SHELL};
    delete @ENV{qw(IFS CDPATH ENV BASH_ENV)};
