<p class="Pp"><b>patch</b> takes a patch file <i>patchfile</i> containing a
    difference listing produced by the <b>diff</b> program and applies those
    differences to one or more original files, producing patched versions.
    Normally the patched versions are put in place of the originals. Backups can
    be made; see the <b>-b</b> or <b>--backup</b> option. The names of the files
    to be patched are usually taken from the patch file, but if there's just one
    file to be patched it can specified on the command line as
    <i>originalfile</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Upon startup, patch attempts to determine the type of the diff
    listing, unless overruled by a <b>-c</b> (<b>--context</b>), <b>-e</b>
    (<b>--ed</b>), <b>-n</b> (<b>--normal</b>), or <b>-u</b> (<b>--unified</b>)
    option. Context diffs (old-style, new-style, and unified) and normal diffs
    are applied by the <b>patch</b> program itself, while <b>ed</b> diffs are
    simply fed to the <b>ed</b>(1) editor via a pipe.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>patch</b> tries to skip any leading garbage, apply the diff,
    and then skip any trailing garbage. Thus you could feed an article or
    message containing a diff listing to <b>patch</b>, and it should work. If
    the entire diff is indented by a consistent amount, or if a context diff
    contains lines ending in CRLF or is encapsulated one or more times by
    prepending &quot;<b>- </b>&quot; to lines starting with &quot;<b>-</b>&quot;
    as specified by Internet RFC 934, this is taken into account. After removing
    indenting or encapsulation, lines beginning with <b>#</b> are ignored, as
    they are considered to be comments.</p>
<p class="Pp">With context diffs, and to a lesser extent with normal diffs,
    <b>patch</b> can detect when the line numbers mentioned in the patch are
    incorrect, and attempts to find the correct place to apply each hunk of the
    patch. As a first guess, it takes the line number mentioned for the hunk,
    plus or minus any offset used in applying the previous hunk. If that is not
    the correct place, <b>patch</b> scans both forwards and backwards for a set
    of lines matching the context given in the hunk. First <b>patch</b> looks
    for a place where all lines of the context match. If no such place is found,
    and it's a context diff, and the maximum fuzz factor is set to 1 or more,
    then another scan takes place ignoring the first and last line of context.
    If that fails, and the maximum fuzz factor is set to 2 or more, the first
    two and last two lines of context are ignored, and another scan is made.
    (The default maximum fuzz factor is 2.) If <b>patch</b> cannot find a place
    to install that hunk of the patch, it puts the hunk out to a reject file,
    which normally is the name of the output file plus a <b>.rej</b> suffix, or
    <b>#</b> if <b>.rej</b> would generate a file name that is too long (if even
    appending the single character <b>#</b> makes the file name too long, then
    <b>#</b> replaces the file name's last character). (The rejected hunk comes
    out in ordinary context diff form regardless of the input patch's form. If
    the input was a normal diff, many of the contexts are simply null.) The line
    numbers on the hunks in the reject file may be different than in the patch
    file: they reflect the approximate location patch thinks the failed hunks
    belong in the new file rather than the old one.</p>
<p class="Pp">As each hunk is completed, you are told if the hunk failed, and if
    so which line (in the new file) <b>patch</b> thought the hunk should go on.
    If the hunk is installed at a different line from the line number specified
    in the diff you are told the offset. A single large offset <i>may</i>
    indicate that a hunk was installed in the wrong place. You are also told if
    a fuzz factor was used to make the match, in which case you should also be
    slightly suspicious. If the <b>--verbose</b> option is given, you are also
    told about hunks that match exactly.</p>
<p class="Pp">If no original file <i>origfile</i> is specified on the command
    line, <b>patch</b> tries to figure out from the leading garbage what the
    name of the file to edit is, using the following rules.</p>
<p class="Pp">First, <b>patch</b> takes an ordered list of candidate file names
    as follows:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b> &#x2022;</b></dt>
  <dd>If the header is that of a context diff, <b>patch</b> takes the old and
      new file names in the header. A name is ignored if it does not have enough
      slashes to satisfy the <b>-p</b><i>num</i> or <b>--strip=</b><i>num</i>
      option. The name <b>/dev/null</b> is also ignored.</dd>
  <dt><b> &#x2022;</b></dt>
  <dd>If there is an <b>Index:</b> line in the leading garbage and if either the
      old and new names are both absent or if <b>patch</b> is conforming to
      POSIX, <b>patch</b> takes the name in the <b>Index:</b> line.</dd>
  <dt><b> &#x2022;</b></dt>
  <dd>For the purpose of the following rules, the candidate file names are
      considered to be in the order (old, new, index), regardless of the order
      that they appear in the header.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Then <b>patch</b> selects a file name from the candidate list as
    follows:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b> &#x2022;</b></dt>
  <dd>If some of the named files exist, <b>patch</b> selects the first name if
      conforming to POSIX, and the best name otherwise.</dd>
  <dt><b> &#x2022;</b></dt>
  <dd>If <b>patch</b> is not ignoring RCS, ClearCase, Perforce, and SCCS (see
      the <b>-g&#x00A0;</b><i>num</i> or <b>--get=</b><i>num</i> option), and no
      named files exist but an RCS, ClearCase, Perforce, or SCCS master is
      found, <b>patch</b> selects the first named file with an RCS, ClearCase,
      Perforce, or SCCS master.</dd>
  <dt><b> &#x2022;</b></dt>
  <dd>If no named files exist, no RCS, ClearCase, Perforce, or SCCS master was
      found, some names are given, <b>patch</b> is not conforming to POSIX, and
      the patch appears to create a file, <b>patch</b> selects the best name
      requiring the creation of the fewest directories.</dd>
  <dt><b> &#x2022;</b></dt>
  <dd>If no file name results from the above heuristics, you are asked for the
      name of the file to patch, and <b>patch</b> selects that name.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">To determine the <i>best</i> of a nonempty list of file names,
    <b>patch</b> first takes all the names with the fewest path name components;
    of those, it then takes all the names with the shortest basename; of those,
    it then takes all the shortest names; finally, it takes the first remaining
    name.</p>
<p class="Pp">Additionally, if the leading garbage contains a <b>Prereq:</b>
    line, <b>patch</b> takes the first word from the prerequisites line
    (normally a version number) and checks the original file to see if that word
    can be found. If not, <b>patch</b> asks for confirmation before
  proceeding.</p>
<p class="Pp">The upshot of all this is that you should be able to say, while in
    a news interface, something like the following:</p>
<p class="Pp">	<b>| patch -d /usr/src/local/blurfl</b></p>
<p class="Pp">and patch a file in the <b>blurfl</b> directory directly from the
    article containing the patch.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the patch file contains more than one patch, <b>patch</b> tries
    to apply each of them as if they came from separate patch files. This means,
    among other things, that it is assumed that the name of the file to patch
    must be determined for each diff listing, and that the garbage before each
    diff listing contains interesting things such as file names and revision
    level, as mentioned previously.</p>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="b"><a class="permalink" href="#b"><b>-b</b> or
    <b>--backup</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Make backup files. That is, when patching a file, rename or copy the
      original instead of removing it. When backing up a file that does not
      exist, an empty, unreadable backup file is created as a placeholder to
      represent the nonexistent file. See the <b>-V</b> or
      <b>--version-control</b> option for details about how backup file names
      are determined.</dd>
  <dt id="backup"><a class="permalink" href="#backup"><b>--backup-if-mismatch</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Back up a file if the patch does not match the file exactly and if backups
      are not otherwise requested. This is the default unless <b>patch</b> is
      conforming to POSIX.</dd>
  <dt id="no"><a class="permalink" href="#no"><b>--no-backup-if-mismatch</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Do not back up a file if the patch does not match the file exactly and if
      backups are not otherwise requested. This is the default if <b>patch</b>
      is conforming to POSIX.</dd>
  <dt id="B"><a class="permalink" href="#B"><b>-B</b> <i>pref</i> or
    <b>--prefix=</b><i>pref</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Prefix <i>pref</i> to a file name when generating its simple backup file
      name. For example, with <b>-B&#x00A0;/junk/</b> the simple backup file
      name for <b>src/patch/util.c</b> is <b>/junk/src/patch/util.c</b>.</dd>
  <dt id="binary"><a class="permalink" href="#binary"><b>--binary</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Read and write all files in binary mode, except for standard output and
      <b>/dev/tty</b>. This option has no effect on POSIX-conforming systems. On
      systems like DOS where this option makes a difference, the patch should be
      generated by <b>diff&#x00A0;-a&#x00A0;--binary</b>.</dd>
  <dt><b>-c</b> or <b>--context</b></dt>
  <dd>Interpret the patch file as a ordinary context diff.</dd>
  <dt id="d"><a class="permalink" href="#d"><b>-d</b> <i>dir</i> or
    <b>--directory=</b><i>dir</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Change to the directory <i>dir</i> immediately, before doing anything
      else.</dd>
  <dt id="D"><a class="permalink" href="#D"><b>-D</b> <i>define</i> or
    <b>--ifdef=</b><i>define</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Use the <b>#ifdef</b> ... <b>#endif</b> construct to mark changes, with
      <i>define</i> as the differentiating symbol.</dd>
  <dt id="dry"><a class="permalink" href="#dry"><b>--dry-run</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Print the results of applying the patches without actually changing any
      files.</dd>
  <dt id="e"><a class="permalink" href="#e"><b>-e</b> or <b>--ed</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Interpret the patch file as an <b>ed</b> script.</dd>
  <dt id="E"><a class="permalink" href="#E"><b>-E</b> or
    <b>--remove-empty-files</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Remove output files that are empty after the patches have been applied.
      Normally this option is unnecessary, since <b>patch</b> can examine the
      time stamps on the header to determine whether a file should exist after
      patching. However, if the input is not a context diff or if <b>patch</b>
      is conforming to POSIX, <b>patch</b> does not remove empty patched files
      unless this option is given. When <b>patch</b> removes a file, it also
      attempts to remove any empty ancestor directories.</dd>
  <dt id="f"><a class="permalink" href="#f"><b>-f</b> or <b>--force</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Assume that the user knows exactly what he or she is doing, and do not ask
      any questions. Skip patches whose headers do not say which file is to be
      patched; patch files even though they have the wrong version for the
      <b>Prereq:</b> line in the patch; and assume that patches are not reversed
      even if they look like they are. This option does not suppress commentary;
      use <b>-s</b> for that.</dd>
  <dt id="F"><a class="permalink" href="#F"><b>-F</b> <i>num</i> or
    <b>--fuzz=</b><i>num</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Set the maximum fuzz factor. This option only applies to diffs that have
      context, and causes <b>patch</b> to ignore up to that many lines in
      looking for places to install a hunk. Note that a larger fuzz factor
      increases the odds of a faulty patch. The default fuzz factor is 2, and it
      may not be set to more than the number of lines of context in the context
      diff, ordinarily 3.</dd>
  <dt id="g"><a class="permalink" href="#g"><b>-g</b> <i>num</i> or
    <b>--get=</b><i>num</i></a></dt>
  <dd>This option controls <b>patch</b>'s actions when a file is under RCS or
      SCCS control, and does not exist or is read-only and matches the default
      version, or when a file is under ClearCase or Perforce control and does
      not exist. If <i>num</i> is positive, <b>patch</b> gets (or checks out)
      the file from the revision control system; if zero, <b>patch</b> ignores
      RCS, ClearCase, Perforce, and SCCS and does not get the file; and if
      negative, <b>patch</b> asks the user whether to get the file. The default
      value of this option is given by the value of the <b>PATCH_GET</b>
      environment variable if it is set; if not, the default value is zero if
      <b>patch</b> is conforming to POSIX, negative otherwise.</dd>
  <dt id="help"><a class="permalink" href="#help"><b>--help</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Print a summary of options and exit.</dd>
  <dt id="i"><a class="permalink" href="#i"><b>-i</b> <i>patchfile</i> or
    <b>--input=</b><i>patchfile</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Read the patch from <i>patchfile</i>. If <i>patchfile</i> is <b>-</b>,
      read from standard input, the default.</dd>
  <dt id="l"><a class="permalink" href="#l"><b>-l</b> or
    <b>--ignore-whitespace</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Match patterns loosely, in case tabs or spaces have been munged in your
      files. Any sequence of one or more blanks in the patch file matches any
      sequence in the original file, and sequences of blanks at the ends of
      lines are ignored. Normal characters must still match exactly. Each line
      of the context must still match a line in the original file.</dd>
  <dt id="n"><a class="permalink" href="#n"><b>-n</b> or
    <b>--normal</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Interpret the patch file as a normal diff.</dd>
  <dt id="N"><a class="permalink" href="#N"><b>-N</b> or
    <b>--forward</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Ignore patches that seem to be reversed or already applied. See also
      <b>-R</b>.</dd>
  <dt id="o"><a class="permalink" href="#o"><b>-o</b> <i>outfile</i> or
    <b>--output=</b><i>outfile</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Send output to <i>outfile</i> instead of patching files in place. Do not
      use this option if <i>outfile</i> is one of the files to be patched.</dd>
  <dt id="p"><a class="permalink" href="#p"><b>-p</b><i>num</i> or
    <b>--strip</b><b>=</b><i>num</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Strip the smallest prefix containing <i>num</i> leading slashes from each
      file name found in the patch file. A sequence of one or more adjacent
      slashes is counted as a single slash. This controls how file names found
      in the patch file are treated, in case you keep your files in a different
      directory than the person who sent out the patch. For example, supposing
      the file name in the patch file was
    <p class="Pp">	<b>/u/howard/src/blurfl/blurfl.c</b></p>
    <p class="Pp">setting <b>-p0</b> gives the entire file name unmodified,
        <b>-p1</b> gives</p>
    <p class="Pp">	<b>u/howard/src/blurfl/blurfl.c</b></p>
    <p class="Pp">without the leading slash, <b>-p4</b> gives</p>
    <p class="Pp">	<b>blurfl/blurfl.c</b></p>
    <p class="Pp">and not specifying <b>-p</b> at all just gives you
        <b>blurfl.c</b>. Whatever you end up with is looked for either in the
        current directory, or the directory specified by the <b>-d</b>
      option.</p>

  <dd>Assume that this patch was created with the old and new files swapped.
      (Yes, I'm afraid that does happen occasionally, human nature being what it
      is.) <b>patch</b> attempts to swap each hunk around before applying it.
      Rejects come out in the swapped format. The <b>-R</b> option does not work
      with <b>ed</b> diff scripts because there is too little information to
      reconstruct the reverse operation.
    <p class="Pp">If the first hunk of a patch fails, <b>patch</b> reverses the
        hunk to see if it can be applied that way. If it can, you are asked if
        you want to have the <b>-R</b> option set. If it can't, the patch
        continues to be applied normally. (Note: this method cannot detect a
        reversed patch if it is a normal diff and if the first command is an
        append (i.e. it should have been a delete) since appends always succeed,
        due to the fact that a null context matches anywhere. Luckily, most
        patches add or change lines rather than delete them, so most reversed
        normal diffs begin with a delete, which fails, triggering the

      time cannot easily be used by people in other time zones, and because
      local time stamps are ambiguous when local clocks move backwards during

<p class="Pp">With numbered or simple backups, if the backup file name is too
    long, the backup suffix <b>~</b> is used instead; if even appending <b>~</b>

    the file name.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="NOTES_FOR_PATCH_SENDERS"><a class="permalink" href="#NOTES_FOR_PATCH_SENDERS">NOTES
  FOR PATCH SENDERS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">There are several things you should bear in mind if you are going
    to be sending out patches.</p>
<p class="Pp">Create your patch systematically. A good method is the command
    <b>diff&#x00A0;-Naur&#x00A0;</b><i>old&#x00A0;new</i> where <i>old</i> and
    <i>new</i> identify the old and new directories. The names <i>old</i> and
    <i>new</i> should not contain any slashes. The <b>diff</b> command's headers
    should have dates and times in Universal Time using traditional Unix format,
    so that patch recipients can use the <b>-Z</b> or <b>--set-utc</b> option.
    Here is an example command, using Bourne shell syntax:</p>
<p class="Pp">	<b>LC_ALL=C TZ=UTC0 diff -Naur gcc-2.7 gcc-2.8</b></p>
<p class="Pp">Tell your recipients how to apply the patch by telling them which
    directory to <b>cd</b> to, and which <b>patch</b> options to use. The option
    string <b>-Np1</b> is recommended. Test your procedure by pretending to be a
    recipient and applying your patch to a copy of the original files.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can save people a lot of grief by keeping a
    <b>patchlevel.h</b> file which is patched to increment the patch level as
    the first diff in the patch file you send out. If you put a <b>Prereq:</b>
    line in with the patch, it won't let them apply patches out of order without
    some warning.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can create a file by sending out a diff that compares
    <b>/dev/null</b> or an empty file dated the Epoch (1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC)
    to the file you want to create. This only works if the file you want to
    create doesn't exist already in the target directory. Conversely, you can
    remove a file by sending out a context diff that compares the file to be
    deleted with an empty file dated the Epoch. The file will be removed unless
    <b>patch</b> is conforming to POSIX and the <b>-E</b> or
    <b>--remove-empty-files</b> option is not given. An easy way to generate
    patches that create and remove files is to use GNU <b>diff</b>'s <b>-N</b>
    or <b>--new-file</b> option.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the recipient is supposed to use the <b>-p</b><i>N</i> option,
    do not send output that looks like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>	diff -Naur v2.0.29/prog/README prog/README</b>
  <br/>
  	--- v2.0.29/prog/README Mon Mar 10 15:13:12 1997
  <br/>
  	+++ prog/README Mon Mar 17 14:58:22 1997</p>
<p class="Pp">because the two file names have different numbers of slashes, and
    different versions of <b>patch</b> interpret the file names differently. To
    avoid confusion, send output that looks like this instead:</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>	diff -Naur v2.0.29/prog/README v2.0.30/prog/README</b>
  <br/>
  	--- v2.0.29/prog/README Mon Mar 10 15:13:12 1997
  <br/>
  	+++ v2.0.30/prog/README Mon Mar 17 14:58:22 1997</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">Avoid sending patches that compare backup file names like
    <b>README.orig</b>, since this might confuse <b>patch</b> into patching a
    backup file instead of the real file. Instead, send patches that compare the
    same base file names in different directories, e.g. <b>old/README</b> and
    <b>new/README</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Take care not to send out reversed patches, since it makes people
    wonder whether they already applied the patch.</p>
<p class="Pp">Try not to have your patch modify derived files (e.g. the file
    <b>configure</b> where there is a line <b>configure: configure.in</b> in
    your makefile), since the recipient should be able to regenerate the derived
    files anyway. If you must send diffs of derived files, generate the diffs
    using UTC, have the recipients apply the patch with the <b>-Z</b> or
    <b>--set-utc</b> option, and have them remove any unpatched files that
    depend on patched files (e.g. with <b>make&#x00A0;clean</b>).</p>
<p class="Pp">While you may be able to get away with putting 582 diff listings
    into one file, it may be wiser to group related patches into separate files
    in case something goes haywire.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DIAGNOSTICS"><a class="permalink" href="#DIAGNOSTICS">DIAGNOSTICS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Diagnostics generally indicate that <b>patch</b> couldn't parse
    your patch file.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the <b>--verbose</b> option is given, the message <b>Hmm...</b>
    indicates that there is unprocessed text in the patch file and that
    <b>patch</b> is attempting to intuit whether there is a patch in that text
    and, if so, what kind of patch it is.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>patch</b>'s exit status is 0 if all hunks are applied
    successfully, 1 if some hunks cannot be applied, and 2 if there is more
    serious trouble. When applying a set of patches in a loop it behooves you to
    check this exit status so you don't apply a later patch to a partially
    patched file.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="CAVEATS"><a class="permalink" href="#CAVEATS">CAVEATS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Context diffs cannot reliably represent the creation or deletion
    of empty files, empty directories, or special files such as symbolic links.
    Nor can they represent changes to file metadata like ownership, permissions,
    or whether one file is a hard link to another. If changes like these are
    also required, separate instructions (e.g. a shell script) to accomplish
    them should accompany the patch.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>patch</b> cannot tell if the line numbers are off in an
    <b>ed</b> script, and can detect bad line numbers in a normal diff only when
    it finds a change or deletion. A context diff using fuzz factor 3 may have
    the same problem. Until a suitable interactive interface is added, you
    should probably do a context diff in these cases to see if the changes made
    sense. Of course, compiling without errors is a pretty good indication that
    the patch worked, but not always.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>patch</b> usually produces the correct results, even when it
    has to do a lot of guessing. However, the results are guaranteed to be
    correct only when the patch is applied to exactly the same version of the
    file that the patch was generated from.</p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="COMPATIBILITY_ISSUES"><a class="permalink" href="#COMPATIBILITY_ISSUES">COMPATIBILITY
  ISSUES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The POSIX standard specifies behavior that differs from
    <b>patch</b>'s traditional behavior. You should be aware of these
    differences if you must interoperate with <b>patch</b> versions 2.1 and
    earlier, which do not conform to POSIX.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b> &#x2022;</b></dt>
  <dd>In traditional <b>patch</b>, the <b>-p</b> option's operand was optional,
      and a bare <b>-p</b> was equivalent to <b>-p0.</b> The <b>-p</b> option
      now requires an operand, and <b>-p&#x00A0;0</b> is now equivalent to
      <b>-p0</b>. For maximum compatibility, use options like <b>-p0</b> and
      <b>-p1</b>.
    <p class="Pp">Also, traditional <b>patch</b> simply counted slashes when
        stripping path prefixes; <b>patch</b> now counts pathname components.
        That is, a sequence of one or more adjacent slashes now counts as a
        single slash. For maximum portability, avoid sending patches containing
        <b>//</b> in file names.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b> &#x2022;</b></dt>
  <dd>In traditional <b>patch</b>, backups were enabled by default. This
      behavior is now enabled with the <b>-b</b> or <b>--backup</b> option.
    <p class="Pp">Conversely, in POSIX <b>patch</b>, backups are never made,
        even when there is a mismatch. In GNU <b>patch</b>, this behavior is
        enabled with the <b>--no-backup-if-mismatch</b> option, or by conforming
        to POSIX with the <b>--posix</b> option or by setting the
        <b>POSIXLY_CORRECT</b> environment variable.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The <b>-b</b><i>&#x00A0;suffix</i> option of traditional
        <b>patch</b> is equivalent to the
        <b>-b&#x00A0;-z</b><i>&#x00A0;suffix</i> options of GNU
      <b>patch</b>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b> &#x2022;</b></dt>
  <dd>Traditional <b>patch</b> used a complicated (and incompletely documented)
      method to intuit the name of the file to be patched from the patch header.
      This method did not conform to POSIX, and had a few gotchas. Now
      <b>patch</b> uses a different, equally complicated (but better documented)
      method that is optionally POSIX-conforming; we hope it has fewer gotchas.
      The two methods are compatible if the file names in the context diff
      header and the <b>Index:</b> line are all identical after
      prefix-stripping. Your patch is normally compatible if each header's file
      names all contain the same number of slashes.</dd>
  <dt><b> &#x2022;</b></dt>
  <dd>When traditional <b>patch</b> asked the user a question, it sent the
      question to standard error and looked for an answer from the first file in
      the following list that was a terminal: standard error, standard output,
      <b>/dev/tty</b>, and standard input. Now <b>patch</b> sends questions to
      standard output and gets answers from <b>/dev/tty</b>. Defaults for some
      answers have been changed so that <b>patch</b> never goes into an infinite
      loop when using default answers.</dd>
  <dt><b> &#x2022;</b></dt>
  <dd>Traditional <b>patch</b> exited with a status value that counted the
      number of bad hunks, or with status 1 if there was real trouble. Now
      <b>patch</b> exits with status 1 if some hunks failed, or with 2 if there
      was real trouble.</dd>
  <dt><b> &#x2022;</b></dt>
  <dd>Limit yourself to the following options when sending instructions meant to
      be executed by anyone running GNU <b>patch</b>, traditional <b>patch</b>,
      or a <b>patch</b> that conforms to POSIX. Spaces are significant in the
      following list, and operands are required.
