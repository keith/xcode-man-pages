<p class="Pp">This is an extension to the curses library. It provides callers
    with a hook into the <b>ncurses</b> data to resize windows, primarily for
    use by programs running in an X Window terminal (e.g., xterm). The function
    <b>resizeterm</b> resizes the standard and current windows to the specified
    dimensions, and adjusts other bookkeeping data used by the <b>ncurses</b>
    library that record the window dimensions.</p>
<p class="Pp">Most of the work is done by the inner function <b>resize_term</b>.
    The outer function <b>resizeterm</b> adds bookkeeping for the SIGWINCH
    handler. When resizing the windows, <b>resize_term</b> blank-fills the areas
    that are extended. The calling application should fill in these areas with
    appropriate data. The <b>resize_term</b> function attempts to resize all
    windows. However, due to the calling convention of pads, it is not possible
    to resize these without additional interaction with the application.</p>
<p class="Pp">A support function <b>is_term_resized</b> is provided so that
    applications can check if the <b>resize_term</b> function would modify the
    window structures. It returns TRUE if the windows would be modified, and
    FALSE otherwise.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="RETURN_VALUE"><a class="permalink" href="#RETURN_VALUE">RETURN
  VALUE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Except as notes, these function return the integer <b>ERR</b> upon
    failure and <b>OK</b> on success. They will fail if either of the dimensions
    are less than or equal to zero, or if an error occurs while (re)allocating
    memory for the windows.</p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="NOTES"><a class="permalink" href="#NOTES">NOTES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">While these functions are intended to be used to support a signal
    handler (i.e., for SIGWINCH), care should be taken to avoid invoking them in
    a context where <b>malloc</b> or <b>realloc</b> may have been interrupted,
    since it uses those functions.</p>
<p class="Pp">If ncurses is configured to supply its own SIGWINCH handler, the
    <b>resizeterm</b> function ungetch's a <b>KEY_RESIZE</b> which will be read
    on the next call to <b>getch</b>. This is used to alert an application that
    the screen size has changed, and that it should repaint special features
    such as pads that cannot be done automatically.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the environment variables <b>LINES</b> or <b>COLUMNS</b> are
    set, this overrides the library's use of the window size obtained from the
    operating system. Thus, even if a SIGWINCH is received, no screen size
    change may be recorded. In that case, no <b>KEY_RESIZE</b> is queued for the
    next call to <b>getch</b>; an <b>ERR</b> will be returned instead.</p>
