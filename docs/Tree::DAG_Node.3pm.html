This class encapsulates/makes/manipulates objects that represent nodes in a tree
  structure. The tree structure is not an object itself, but is emergent from
  the linkages you create between nodes. This class provides the methods for
  making linkages that can be used to build up a tree, while preventing you from
  ever making any kinds of linkages which are not allowed in a tree (such as
  having a node be its own mother or ancestor, or having a node have two
  mothers).
<p class="Pp">This is what I mean by a &quot;tree structure&quot;, a bit
    redundantly stated:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>o A tree is a special case of an acyclic directed graph</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>o A tree is a network of nodes where there's exactly one root node</dt>
  <dd>Also, the only primary relationship between nodes is the mother-daughter
      relationship.</dd>
  <dt>o No node can be its own mother, or its mother's mother, etc</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>o Each node in the tree has exactly one parent</dt>
  <dd>Except for the root of course, which is parentless.</dd>
  <dt>o Each node can have any number (0 .. N) daughter nodes</dt>
  <dd>A given node's daughter nodes constitute an <i>ordered</i> list.
    <p class="Pp">However, you are free to consider this ordering irrelevant.
        Some applications do need daughters to be ordered, so I chose to
        consider this the general case.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>o A node can appear in only one tree, and only once in that tree</dt>
  <dd>Notably (notable because it doesn't follow from the two above points), a
      node cannot appear twice in its mother's daughter list.</dd>
  <dt>o There's an idea of up versus down</dt>
  <dd>Up means towards to the root, and down means away from the root (and
      towards the leaves).</dd>
  <dt>o There's an idea of left versus right</dt>
  <dd>Left is toward the start (index 0) of a given node's daughter list, and
      right is toward the end of a given node's daughter list.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Trees as described above have various applications, among them:
    representing syntactic constituency, in formal linguistics; representing
    contingencies in a game tree; representing abstract syntax in the parsing of
    any computer language -- whether in expression trees for programming
    languages, or constituency in the parse of a markup language document. (Some
    of these might not use the fact that daughters are ordered.)</p>
<p class="Pp">(Note: B-Trees are a very special case of the above kinds of
    trees, and are best treated with their own class. Check CPAN for modules
    encapsulating B-Trees; or if you actually want a database, and for some
    reason ended up looking here, go look at AnyDBM_File.)</p>
<p class="Pp">Many base classes are not usable except as such -- but
    <span class="Li">&quot;Tree::DAG_Node&quot;</span> can be used as a normal
    class. You can go ahead and say:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
        use Tree::DAG_Node;
        my $root = Tree::DAG_Node-&gt;new();
        $root-&gt;name(&quot;I'm the tops&quot;);
        $new_daughter = Tree::DAG_Node-&gt;new();
        $new_daughter-&gt;name(&quot;More&quot;);
        $root-&gt;add_daughter($new_daughter);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">and so on, constructing and linking objects from
    <span class="Li">&quot;Tree::DAG_Node&quot;</span> and making useful tree
    structures out of them.</p>

  NOTE TO THE READER</a></h1>
This class is big and provides lots of methods. If your problem is simple (say,
  just representing a simple parse tree), this class might seem like using an
  atomic sledgehammer to swat a fly. But the complexity of this module's bells
  and whistles shouldn't detract from the efficiency of using this class for a
  simple purpose. In fact, I'd be very surprised if any one user ever had use
  for more that even a third of the methods in this class. And remember: an
  atomic sledgehammer <b>will</b> kill that fly.
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="OBJECT_CONTENTS"><a class="permalink" href="#OBJECT_CONTENTS">OBJECT
  CONTENTS</a></h1>
Implementationally, each node in a tree is an object, in the sense of being an
  arbitrarily complex data structure that belongs to a class (presumably
  <span class="Li">&quot;Tree::DAG_Node&quot;</span>, or ones derived from it)
  that provides methods.
<p class="Pp">The attributes of a node-object are:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>o mother -- this node's mother. undef if this is a root</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>o daughters -- the (possibly empty) list of daughters of this node</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>o name -- the name for this node</dt>
  <dd>Need not be unique, or even printable. This is printed in some of the
      various dumper methods, but it's up to you if you don't put anything
      meaningful or printable here.</dd>
  <dt>o attributes -- whatever the user wants to use it for</dt>
  <dd>Presumably a hashref to whatever other attributes the user wants to store
      without risk of colliding with the object's real attributes. (Example
      usage: attributes to an SGML tag -- you definitely wouldn't want the
      existence of a &quot;mother=foo&quot; pair in such a tag to collide with a
      node object's 'mother' attribute.)
    <p class="Pp">Aside from (by default) initializing it to {}, and having the
        access method called &quot;attributes&quot; (described a ways below), I
        don't do anything with the &quot;attributes&quot; in this module. I
        basically intended this so that users who don't want/need to bother
        deriving a class from
        <span class="Li">&quot;Tree::DAG_Node&quot;</span>, could still attach
        whatever data they wanted in a node.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">&quot;mother&quot; and &quot;daughters&quot; are attributes that
    relate to linkage -- they are never written to directly, but are changed as
    appropriate by the &quot;linkage methods&quot;, discussed below.</p>
<p class="Pp">The other two (and whatever others you may add in derived classes)
    are simply accessed thru the same-named methods, discussed further
  below.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="About_The_Documented_Interface"><a class="permalink" href="#About_The_Documented_Interface">About
  The Documented Interface</a></h2>
Stick to the documented interface (and comments in the source -- especially ones
  saying &quot;undocumented!&quot; and/or &quot;disfavored!&quot; -- do not
  count as documentation!), and don't rely on any behavior that's not in the
  documented interface.
<p class="Pp">Specifically, unless the documentation for a particular method
    says &quot;this method returns thus-and-such a value&quot;, then you should
    not rely on it returning anything meaningful.</p>
<p class="Pp">A <i>passing</i> acquaintance with at least the broader details of
    the source code for this class is assumed for anyone using this class as a
    base class -- especially if you're overriding existing methods, and
    <b>definitely</b> if you're overriding linkage methods.</p>

  <dd>This creates a new node object, calls

      defaults (like: undef name, undef mother, no daughters, 'attributes'
      setting of a new empty hashref), and returns the object created. (If you
      just said &quot;CLASS-&gt;<b>new()</b>&quot; or &quot;CLASS-&gt;new&quot;,
      then it pretends you called &quot;CLASS-&gt;new({})&quot;.)
    <p class="Pp">See also the comments under &quot;new($hashref)&quot; for

    <p class="Pp">If you use <span class="Li">&quot;Tree::DAG_Node&quot;</span>
        as a superclass, and you add attributes that need to be initialized,
        what you need to do is provide an _init method that calls
        <span class="Li">$this</span>-&gt;SUPER::_init($options) to use its
        superclass's _init method, and then initializes the new attributes:</p>

  <dd>Just another way to get at the &quot;new($hashref)&quot; method. This

      <span class="Li">$obj2</span> =
    <span class="Li">$class</span>-&gt;new;</dd>
  <dt>the method $node-&gt;_init($options)</dt>
  <dd>Initialize the object's attribute values. See the discussion above.
      Presumably this should be called only by the guts of the
      &quot;new($hashref)&quot; constructor -- never by the end user.
    <p class="Pp">Currently there are no documented options for putting in the
        <span class="Li">$options</span> hashref, but (in case you want to
        disregard the above rant) the option exists for you to use
        <span class="Li">$options</span> for something useful in a derived

This method adds the node objects in LIST to the (right) end of
  <span class="Li">$mother</span>'s <i>daughter</i> list. Making a node N1 the
  daughter of another node N2 also means that N1's <i>mother</i> attribute is
  &quot;automatically&quot; set to N2; it also means that N1 stops being
  anything else's daughter as it becomes N2's daughter.
<p class="Pp">If you try to make a node its own mother, a fatal error results.
    If you try to take one of a node N1's ancestors and make it also a daughter
    of N1, a fatal error results. A fatal error results if anything in LIST
    isn't a node object.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you try to make N1 a daughter of N2, but it's <b>already</b> a

This adds the elements in LIST (in that order) as immediate left sisters of
  <span class="Li">$node</span>. In other words, given that B's mother's

With the first syntax, returns the address of <span class="Li">$node</span>
  within its tree, based on its position within the tree. An address is formed
  by noting the path between the root and <span class="Li">$node</span>, and
  concatenating the daughter-indices of the nodes this passes thru (starting
  with 0 for the root, and ending with <span class="Li">$node</span>).
<p class="Pp">For example, if to get from node ROOT to node
    <span class="Li">$node</span>, you pass thru ROOT, A, B, and
    <span class="Li">$node</span>, then the address is determined as:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>o ROOT's my_daughter_index is 0</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>o A's my_daughter_index is, suppose, 2</dt>
  <dd>A is index 2 in ROOT's daughter list.</dd>
  <dt>o B's my_daughter_index is, suppose, 0</dt>
  <dd>B is index 0 in A's daughter list.</dd>
  <dt>o $node's my_daughter_index is, suppose, 4</dt>
  <dd><span class="Li">$node</span> is index 4 in B's daughter list.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The address of the above-described <span class="Li">$node</span>
    is, therefore, &quot;0:2:0:4&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">(As a somewhat special case, the address of the root is always
    &quot;0&quot;; and since addresses start from the root, all addresses start
    with a &quot;0&quot;.)</p>
<p class="Pp">The second syntax, where you provide an address, starts from the
    root of the tree <span class="Li">$anynode</span> belongs to, and returns
    the node corresponding to that address. Returns undef if no node corresponds
    to that address. Note that this routine may be somewhat liberal in its
    interpretation of what can constitute an address; i.e., it accepts
    &quot;0.2.0.4&quot;, besides &quot;0:2:0:4&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">Also note that the address of a node in a tree is meaningful only
    in that tree as currently structured.</p>
<p class="Pp">(Consider how ($address1 cmp <span class="Li">$address2</span>)
    may be magically meaningful to you, if you meant to figure out what nodes
    are to the right of what other nodes.)</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="_fBancestors()_fP"><a class="permalink" href="#_fBancestors()_fP"><b>ancestors()</b></a></h2>
Returns the list of this node's ancestors, starting with its mother, then
  grandmother, and ending at the root. It does this by simply following the
  'mother' attributes up as far as it can. So if <span class="Li">$item</span>
  IS the root, this returns an empty list.

<h2 class="Ss" id="_fBdelete_tree()_fP"><a class="permalink" href="#_fBdelete_tree()_fP"><b>delete_tree()</b></a></h2>
Destroys the entire tree that <span class="Li">$node</span> is a member of
  (starting at the root), by nulling out each node-object's attributes
  (including, most importantly, its linkage attributes -- hopefully this is more
  than sufficient to eliminate all circularity in the data structure), and then
  moving it into the class DEADNODE.
<p class="Pp">Use this when you're finished with the tree in question, and want
    to free up its memory. (If you don't do this, it'll get freed up anyway when
    your program ends.)</p>
<p class="Pp">If you try calling any methods on any of the node objects in the
    tree you've destroyed, you'll get an error like:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  Can't locate object method &quot;leaves_under&quot;
    via package &quot;DEADNODE&quot;.
</pre>
<p class="Pp">So if you see that, that's what you've done wrong. (Actually, the
    class DEADNODE does provide one method: a no-op method
    &quot;delete_tree&quot;. So if you want to delete a tree, but think you may
    have deleted it already, it's safe to call
    <span class="Li">$node</span>-&gt;delete_tree on it (again).)</p>
<p class="Pp">The &quot;<b>delete_tree()</b>&quot; method is needed because
    Perl's garbage collector would never (as currently implemented) see that it
    was time to de-allocate the memory the tree uses -- until either you call
    <span class="Li">$node</span>-&gt;delete_tree, or until the program stops
    (at &quot;global destruction&quot; time, when <b>everything</b> is
    unallocated).</p>
<p class="Pp">Incidentally, there are better ways to do garbage-collecting on a
    tree, ways which don't require the user to explicitly call a method like
    &quot;<b>delete_tree()</b>&quot; -- they involve dummy classes, as explained
    at &lt;http://mox.perl.com/misc/circle-destroy.pod&gt;</p>
<p class="Pp">However, introducing a dummy class concept into
    <span class="Li">&quot;Tree::DAG_Node&quot;</span> would be rather a
    distraction. If you want to do this with your derived classes, via a DESTROY
    in a dummy class (or in a tree-metainformation class, maybe), then feel free
    to.</p>
<p class="Pp">The only case where I can imagine &quot;<b>delete_tree()</b>&quot;
    failing to totally void the tree, is if you use the hashref in the
    &quot;attributes&quot; attribute to store (presumably among other things)
    references to other nodes' &quot;attributes&quot; hashrefs -- which 1) is
    maybe a bit odd, and 2) is your problem, because it's your hash structure
    that's circular, not the tree's. Anyway, consider:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
      # null out all my &quot;attributes&quot; hashes
      $anywhere-&gt;root-&gt;walk_down({
        'callback' =&gt; sub {
          $hr = $_[0]-&gt;attributes; %$hr = (); return 1;
        }
      });
      # And then:
      $anywhere-&gt;delete_tree;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">(I suppose &quot;<b>delete_tree()</b>&quot; is a
    &quot;destructor&quot;, or as close as you can meaningfully come for a
    circularity-rich data structure in Perl.)</p>

This replaces <span class="Li">$node</span> in its mother's daughter list, by
  unlinking <span class="Li">$node</span> and replacing it with the items in
  LIST. This returns a list consisting of <span class="Li">$node</span> followed
  by LIST, i.e., the nodes that replaced it.
<p class="Pp">LIST can include <span class="Li">$node</span> itself (presumably
    at most once). LIST can also be the empty list. However, if any items in
    LIST are sisters to <span class="Li">$node</span>, they are ignored, and are
    not in the copy of LIST passed as the return value.</p>
<p class="Pp">As you might expect for any linking operation, the items in LIST
    cannot be <span class="Li">$node</span>'s mother, or any ancestor to it; and
    items in LIST are, of course, unlinked from their mothers (if they have any)
    as they're linked to <span class="Li">$node</span>'s mother.</p>
<p class="Pp">(In the special (and bizarre) case where
    <span class="Li">$node</span> is root, this simply calls

    LIST, making them roots of their own trees.)</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that the daughter-list of <span class="Li">$node</span> is
    not necessarily affected; nor are the daughter-lists of the items in LIST. I
    mention this in case you think replace_with switches one node for another,
    with respect to its mother list <b>and</b> its daughter list, leaving the
    rest of the tree unchanged. If that's what you want, replacing
    <span class="Li">$Old</span> with <span class="Li">$New</span>, then you
    want:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  $New-&gt;set_daughters($Old-&gt;clear_daughters);
  $Old-&gt;replace_with($New);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">(I can't say <span class="Li">$node</span>'s and LIST-items'
    daughter lists are <b>never</b> affected my replace_with -- they can be
    affected in this case:</p>

  $N3 = Tree::DAG_Node-&gt;random_network; # or whatever
  $node-&gt;replace_with($N1, $N2, $N3);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">As a side affect of attaching <span class="Li">$N1</span> and
    <span class="Li">$N2</span> to <span class="Li">$node</span>'s mother,
    they're unlinked from their parents ($node, and <span class="Li">$N1</span>,
    respectively). But N3's daughter list is unaffected.</p>

  daughterless as its daughters move up and take its place. This returns a list
  consisting of <span class="Li">$node</span> followed by the nodes that were
  its daughters.
<p class="Pp">In the special (and bizarre) case where
    <span class="Li">$node</span> is root, this simply unlinks its daughters
    from it, making them roots of their own trees.</p>
<p class="Pp">Effectively the same as

    more efficient, since less checking has to be done. (And I also think
    <span class="Li">$node</span>-&gt;replace_with_daughters is a more common

Performs a depth-first traversal of the structure at and under
  <span class="Li">$node</span>. What it does at each node depends on the value
  of the options hashref, which you must provide. There are three options,
  &quot;callback&quot; and &quot;callbackback&quot; (at least one of which must
  be defined, as a sub reference), and &quot;_depth&quot;.
<p class="Pp">This is what <i></i><b><i>walk_down()</i></b><i></i> does, in
    pseudocode form:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>o Starting point</dt>
  <dd>Start at the <span class="Li">$node</span> given.</dd>
  <dt>o Callback</dt>
  <dd>If there's a <i>callback</i>, call it with <span class="Li">$node</span>
      as the first argument, and the options hashref as the second argument
      (which contains the potentially useful <i>_depth</i>, remember). This
      function must return true or false -- if false, it will block the next
      step:</dd>
  <dt>o Daughters</dt>
  <dd>If <span class="Li">$node</span> has any daughter nodes, increment
      <i>_depth</i>, and call
      <span class="Li">$daughter</span>-&gt;walk_down($options) for each
      daughter (in order, of course), where options_hashref is the same hashref
      it was called with. When this returns, decrements <i>_depth</i>.</dd>
  <dt>Callbackback</dt>
  <dd>If there's a <i>callbackback</i>, call just it as with <i>callback</i>
      (but tossing out the return value). Note that <i>callback</i> returning
      false blocks traversal below <span class="Li">$node</span>, but doesn't
      block calling callbackback for <span class="Li">$node</span>.
      (Incidentally, in the unlikely case that <span class="Li">$node</span> has
      stopped being a node object, <i>callbackback</i> won't get called.)</dd>
  <dt>o Return</dt>
  <dd></dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">$node</span>-&gt;walk_down($options) is the way
    to recursively do things to a tree (if you start at the root) or part of a
    tree; if what you're doing is best done via pre-pre order traversal, use
    <i>callback</i>; if what you're doing is best done with post-order
    traversal, use <i>callbackback</i>. <i></i><b><i>walk_down()</i></b><i></i>
    is even the basis for plenty of the methods in this class. See the source
    code for examples both simple and horrific.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that if you don't specify <i>_depth</i>, it effectively
    defaults to 0. You should set it to scalar($node-&gt;ancestors) if you want
    <i>_depth</i> to reflect the true depth-in-the-tree for the nodes called,
    instead of just the depth below <span class="Li">$node</span>. (If
    <span class="Li">$node</span> is the root, there's no difference, of
    course.)</p>
<p class="Pp">And <b>by the way</b>, it's a bad idea to modify the tree from the
    callback. Unpredictable things may happen. I instead suggest having your
    callback add to a stack of things that need changing, and then, once
    <i></i><b><i>walk_down()</i></b><i></i> is all finished, changing those
    nodes from that stack.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that the existence of <i></i><b><i>walk_down()</i></b><i></i>
    doesn't mean you can't write you own special-use traversers.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="WHEN_AND_HOW_TO_DESTROY_THE_TREE"><a class="permalink" href="#WHEN_AND_HOW_TO_DESTROY_THE_TREE">WHEN
  AND HOW TO DESTROY THE TREE</a></h1>
It should be clear to you that if you've built a big parse tree or something,
  and then you're finished with it, you should call
  <span class="Li">$some_node</span>-&gt;delete_tree on it if you want the
  memory back.
<p class="Pp">But consider this case: you've got this tree:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
      A
    / | \
   B  C  D
   |     | \
   E     X  Y
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Let's say you decide you don't want D or any of its descendants in
    the tree, so you call D-&gt;unlink_from_mother. This does NOT automagically
    destroy the tree D-X-Y. Instead it merely splits the tree into two:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
     A                        D
    / \                      / \
   B   C                    X   Y
   |
   E
</pre>
<p class="Pp">To destroy D and its little tree, you have to explicitly call
    delete_tree on it.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note, however, that if you call C-&gt;unlink_from_mother, and if
    you don't have a link to C anywhere, then it <b>does</b> magically go away.
    This is because nothing links to C -- whereas with the D-X-Y tree, D links
    to X and Y, and X and Y each link back to D. Note that calling
    C-&gt;delete_tree is harmless -- after all, a tree of only one node is still
    a tree.</p>
<p class="Pp">So, this is a surefire way of getting rid of all
    <span class="Li">$node</span>'s children and freeing up the memory
    associated with them and their descendants:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  foreach my $it ($node-&gt;clear_daughters) { $it-&gt;delete_tree }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Just be sure not to do this:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  foreach my $it ($node-&gt;daughters) { $it-&gt;delete_tree }
  $node-&gt;clear_daughters;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">That's bad; the first call to
    <span class="Li">$_</span>-&gt;delete_tree will climb to the root of
    <span class="Li">$node</span>'s tree, and nuke the whole tree, not just the
    bits under <span class="Li">$node</span>. You might as well have just called
    <span class="Li">$node</span>-&gt;delete_tree. (Moreavor, once
    <span class="Li">$node</span> is dead, you can't call clear_daughters on it,
    so you'll get an error there.)</p>

If you develop a given routine for dealing with trees in some way, and use it a
  lot, then if you think it'd be of use to anyone else, do email me about it; it
  might be helpful to others to include that routine, or something based on it,
  in a later version of this module.
<p class="Pp">It's occurred to me that you might like to (and might yourself
    develop routines to) draw trees in something other than ASCII art. If you do
    so -- say, for PostScript output, or for output interpretable by some
    external plotting program -- I'd be most interested in the results.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="RAMBLINGS"><a class="permalink" href="#RAMBLINGS">RAMBLINGS</a></h1>
This module uses &quot;strict&quot;, but I never wrote it with -w warnings in
  mind -- so if you use -w, do not be surprised if you see complaints from the
  guts of DAG_Node. As long as there is no way to turn off -w for a given module
  (instead of having to do it in every single subroutine with a &quot;local
  $^W&quot;), I'm not going to change this. However, I do, at points, get bursts
  of ambition, and I try to fix code in DAG_Node that generates warnings, <i>as
  I come across them</i> -- which is only occasionally. Feel free to email me
  any patches for any such fixes you come up with, tho.
<p class="Pp">Currently I don't assume (or enforce) anything about the class
    membership of nodes being manipulated, other than by testing whether each
    one provides a method &quot;<b>is_node()</b>&quot;, a la:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  die &quot;Not a node!!!&quot; unless UNIVERSAL::can($node, &quot;is_node&quot;);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">So, as far as I'm concerned, a given tree's nodes are free to
    belong to different classes, just so long as they provide/inherit
    &quot;<b>is_node()</b>&quot;, the few methods that this class relies on to
    navigate the tree, and have the same internal object structure, or a
    superset of it. Presumably this would be the case for any object belonging
    to a class derived from <span class="Li">&quot;Tree::DAG_Node&quot;</span>,
    or belonging to <span class="Li">&quot;Tree::DAG_Node&quot;</span>
  itself.</p>
<p class="Pp">When routines in this class access a node's &quot;mother&quot;
    attribute, or its &quot;daughters&quot; attribute, they (generally) do so
    directly (via <span class="Li">$node</span>-&gt;{'mother'}, etc.), for sake
    of efficiency. But classes derived from this class should probably do this
    instead thru a method (via <span class="Li">$node</span>-&gt;mother, etc.),
    for sake of portability, abstraction, and general goodness.</p>
<p class="Pp">However, no routines in this class (aside from, necessarily,
    <i></i> <b><i>_init()</i></b><i></i>,
    <i></i><b><i>_init_name()</i></b><i></i>, and &quot;<b>name()</b>&quot;)
    access the &quot;name&quot; attribute directly; routines (like the various
    tree draw/dump methods) get the &quot;name&quot; value thru a call to
    <span class="Li">$obj</span>-&gt;<b>name()</b>. So if you want the object's
    name to not be a real attribute, but instead have it derived dynamically
    from some feature of the object (say, based on some of its other attributes,
    or based on its address), you can to override the &quot;<b>name()</b>&quot;
    method, without causing problems. (Be sure to consider the case of
    <span class="Li">$obj</span>-&gt;name as a write method, as it's used in
    <i>/lol_to_tree($lol)</i> and &quot;random_network($options)&quot;.)</p>
