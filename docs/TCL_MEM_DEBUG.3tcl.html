   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

  debugging</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">When Tcl is compiled with <b>TCL_MEM_DEBUG</b> defined, a powerful
    set of memory debugging aids is included in the compiled binary. This
    includes C and Tcl functions which can aid with debugging memory leaks,
    memory allocation overruns, and other memory related errors.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="ENABLING_MEMORY_DEBUGGING"><a class="permalink" href="#ENABLING_MEMORY_DEBUGGING">ENABLING
  MEMORY DEBUGGING</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">To enable memory debugging, Tcl should be recompiled from scratch
    with <b>TCL_MEM_DEBUG</b> defined (e.g. by passing the
    <i>--enable-symbols=mem</i> flag to the <i>configure</i> script when
    building). This will also compile in a non-stub version of
    <b>Tcl_InitMemory</b> to add the <b>memory</b> command to Tcl.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>TCL_MEM_DEBUG</b> must be either left defined for all modules
    or undefined for all modules that are going to be linked together. If they
    are not, link errors will occur, with either <b>Tcl_DbCkfree</b> and
    <b>Tcl_DbCkalloc</b> or <b>Tcl_Ckalloc</b> and <b>Tcl_Ckfree</b> being
    undefined.</p>
<p class="Pp">Once memory debugging support has been compiled into Tcl, the C
    functions <b>Tcl_ValidateAllMemory</b>, and <b>Tcl_DumpActiveMemory</b>, and
    the Tcl <b>memory</b> command can be used to validate and examine memory
    usage.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="GUARD_ZONES"><a class="permalink" href="#GUARD_ZONES">GUARD
  ZONES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">When memory debugging is enabled, whenever a call to
    <b>ckalloc</b> is made, slightly more memory than requested is allocated so
    the memory debugging code can keep track of the allocated memory, and
    eight-byte &#x201C;guard zones&#x201D; are placed in front of and behind the
    space that will be returned to the caller. (The sizes of the guard zones are
    defined by the C #define <b>LOW_GUARD_SIZE</b> and #define
    <b>HIGH_GUARD_SIZE</b> in the file <i>generic/tclCkalloc.c</i> &#x2014; it
    can be extended if you suspect large overwrite problems, at some cost in
    performance.) A known pattern is written into the guard zones and, on a call
    to <b>ckfree</b>, the guard zones of the space being freed are checked to
    see if either zone has been modified in any way. If one has been, the guard
    bytes and their new contents are identified, and a &#x201C;low guard
    failed&#x201D; or &#x201C;high guard failed&#x201D; message is issued. The
    &#x201C;guard failed&#x201D; message includes the address of the memory
    packet and the file name and line number of the code that called
    <b>ckfree</b>. This allows you to detect the common sorts of one-off
    problems, where not enough space was allocated to contain the data written,
    for example.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="DEBUGGING_DIFFICULT_MEMORY_CORRUPTION_PROBLEMS"><a class="permalink" href="#DEBUGGING_DIFFICULT_MEMORY_CORRUPTION_PROBLEMS">DEBUGGING
  DIFFICULT MEMORY CORRUPTION PROBLEMS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Normally, Tcl compiled with memory debugging enabled will make it
    easy to isolate a corruption problem. Turning on memory validation with the
    memory command can help isolate difficult problems. If you suspect (or know)
    that corruption is occurring before the Tcl interpreter comes up far enough
    for you to issue commands, you can set <b>MEM_VALIDATE</b> define, recompile
    tclCkalloc.c and rebuild Tcl. This will enable memory validation from the
    first call to <b>ckalloc</b>, again, at a large performance impact.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you are desperate and validating memory on every call to
    <b>ckalloc</b> and <b>ckfree</b> is not enough, you can explicitly call
    <b>Tcl_ValidateAllMemory</b> directly at any point. It takes a <i>char</i>
    <i>*</i> and an <i>int</i> which are normally the filename and line number
    of the caller, but they can actually be anything you want. Remember to
    remove the calls after you find the problem.</p>
