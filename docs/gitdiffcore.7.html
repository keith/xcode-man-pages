gitdiffcore - Tweaking diff output

The diff commands <i>git diff-index</i>, <i>git diff-files</i>, and <i>git
  diff-tree</i> can be told to manipulate differences they find in
  unconventional ways before showing <i>diff</i> output. The manipulation is
  collectively called &quot;diffcore transformation&quot;. This short note
  describes what they are and how to use them to produce <i>diff</i> output that
  is easier to understand than the conventional kind.
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="THE_CHAIN_OF_OPERATION"><a class="permalink" href="#THE_CHAIN_OF_OPERATION">THE
  CHAIN OF OPERATION</a></h1>
The <i>git diff-*</i> family works by first comparing two sets of files:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<i>git diff-index</i> compares contents of a
  &quot;tree&quot; object and the working directory (when <b>--cached</b> flag
  is not used) or a &quot;tree&quot; object and the index file (when
  <b>--cached</b> flag is used);</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<i>git diff-files</i> compares contents of the
  index file and the working directory;</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<i>git diff-tree</i> compares contents of two
  &quot;tree&quot; objects;</div>
<p class="Pp">In all of these cases, the commands themselves first optionally
    limit the two sets of files by any pathspecs given on their command-lines,
    and compare corresponding paths in the two resulting sets of files.</p>
<p class="Pp">The pathspecs are used to limit the world diff operates in. They
    remove the filepairs outside the specified sets of pathnames. E.g. If the
    input set of filepairs included:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
:100644 100644 bcd1234... 0123456... M junkfile
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">but the command invocation was <b>git diff-files myfile</b>, then
    the junkfile entry would be removed from the list because only
    &quot;myfile&quot; is under consideration.</p>
<p class="Pp">The result of comparison is passed from these commands to what is
    internally called &quot;diffcore&quot;, in a format similar to what is
    output when the -p option is not used. E.g.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
in-place edit  :100644 100644 bcd1234... 0123456... M file0
create         :000000 100644 0000000... 1234567... A file4
delete         :100644 000000 1234567... 0000000... D file5
unmerged       :000000 000000 0000000... 0000000... U file6
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">The diffcore mechanism is fed a list of such comparison results
    (each of which is called &quot;filepair&quot;, although at this point each
    of them talks about a single file), and transforms such a list into another
    list. There are currently 5 such transformations:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;diffcore-break</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;diffcore-rename</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;diffcore-merge-broken</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;diffcore-pickaxe</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;diffcore-order</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;diffcore-rotate</div>
<p class="Pp">These are applied in sequence. The set of filepairs <i>git
    diff-*</i> commands find are used as the input to diffcore-break, and the
    output from diffcore-break is used as the input to the next transformation.
    The final result is then passed to the output routine and generates either
    diff-raw format (see Output format sections of the manual for <i>git
    diff-*</i> commands) or diff-patch format.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DIFFCORE_-BREAK:_FOR_SPLITTING_UP_COMPLETE_REWRITES"><a class="permalink" href="#DIFFCORE_-BREAK:_FOR_SPLITTING_UP_COMPLETE_REWRITES">DIFFCORE-BREAK:
  FOR SPLITTING UP COMPLETE REWRITES</a></h1>
The second transformation in the chain is diffcore-break, and is controlled by
  the -B option to the <i>git diff-*</i> commands. This is used to detect a
  filepair that represents &quot;complete rewrite&quot; and break such filepair
  into two filepairs that represent delete and create. E.g. If the input
  contained this filepair:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
:100644 100644 bcd1234... 0123456... M file0
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">and if it detects that the file &quot;file0&quot; is completely
    rewritten, it changes it to:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
:100644 000000 bcd1234... 0000000... D file0
:000000 100644 0000000... 0123456... A file0
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">For the purpose of breaking a filepair, diffcore-break examines
    the extent of changes between the contents of the files before and after
    modification (i.e. the contents that have &quot;bcd1234...&quot; and
    &quot;0123456...&quot; as their SHA-1 content ID, in the above example). The
    amount of deletion of original contents and insertion of new material are
    added together, and if it exceeds the &quot;break score&quot;, the filepair
    is broken into two. The break score defaults to 50% of the size of the
    smaller of the original and the result (i.e. if the edit shrinks the file,
    the size of the result is used; if the edit lengthens the file, the size of
    the original is used), and can be customized by giving a number after
    &quot;-B&quot; option (e.g. &quot;-B75&quot; to tell it to use 75%).</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="DIFFCORE_-RENAME:_FOR_DETECTING_RENAMES_AND_COPIES"><a class="permalink" href="#DIFFCORE_-RENAME:_FOR_DETECTING_RENAMES_AND_COPIES">DIFFCORE-RENAME:
  FOR DETECTING RENAMES AND COPIES</a></h1>
This transformation is used to detect renames and copies, and is controlled by
  the -M option (to detect renames) and the -C option (to detect copies as well)
  to the <i>git diff-*</i> commands. If the input contained these filepairs:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
:100644 000000 0123456... 0000000... D fileX
:000000 100644 0000000... 0123456... A file0
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">and the contents of the deleted file fileX is similar enough to
    the contents of the created file file0, then rename detection merges these
    filepairs and creates:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
:100644 100644 0123456... 0123456... R100 fileX file0
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">When the &quot;-C&quot; option is used, the original contents of
    modified files, and deleted files (and also unmodified files, if the
    &quot;--find-copies-harder&quot; option is used) are considered as
    candidates of the source files in rename/copy operation. If the input were
    like these filepairs, that talk about a modified file fileY and a newly
    created file file0:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
:100644 100644 0123456... 1234567... M fileY
:000000 100644 0000000... bcd3456... A file0
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">the original contents of fileY and the resulting contents of file0
    are compared, and if they are similar enough, they are changed to:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
:100644 100644 0123456... 1234567... M fileY
:100644 100644 0123456... bcd3456... C100 fileY file0
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">In both rename and copy detection, the same &quot;extent of
    changes&quot; algorithm used in diffcore-break is used to determine if two
    files are &quot;similar enough&quot;, and can be customized to use a
    similarity score different from the default of 50% by giving a number after
    the &quot;-M&quot; or &quot;-C&quot; option (e.g. &quot;-M8&quot; to tell it
    to use 8/10 = 80%).</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that when rename detection is on but both copy and break
    detection are off, rename detection adds a preliminary step that first
    checks if files are moved across directories while keeping their filename
    the same. If there is a file added to a directory whose contents is
    sufficiently similar to a file with the same name that got deleted from a
    different directory, it will mark them as renames and exclude them from the
    later quadratic step (the one that pairwise compares all unmatched files to
    find the &quot;best&quot; matches, determined by the highest content
    similarity). So, for example, if a deleted docs/ext.txt and an added
    docs/config/ext.txt are similar enough, they will be marked as a rename and
    prevent an added docs/ext.md that may be even more similar to the deleted
    docs/ext.txt from being considered as the rename destination in the later
    step. For this reason, the preliminary &quot;match same filename&quot; step
    uses a bit higher threshold to mark a file pair as a rename and stop
    considering other candidates for better matches. At most, one comparison is
    done per file in this preliminary pass; so if there are several remaining
    ext.txt files throughout the directory hierarchy after exact rename
    detection, this preliminary step may be skipped for those files.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note. When the &quot;-C&quot; option is used with
    <b>--find-copies-harder</b> option, <i>git diff-*</i> commands feed
    unmodified filepairs to diffcore mechanism as well as modified ones. This
    lets the copy detector consider unmodified files as copy source candidates
    at the expense of making it slower. Without <b>--find-copies-harder</b>,
    <i>git diff-*</i> commands can detect copies only if the file that was
    copied happened to have been modified in the same changeset.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="DIFFCORE_-MERGE_-BROKEN:_FOR_PUTTING_COMPLETE_REWRITES_BACK_TOGETHER"><a class="permalink" href="#DIFFCORE_-MERGE_-BROKEN:_FOR_PUTTING_COMPLETE_REWRITES_BACK_TOGETHER">DIFFCORE-MERGE-BROKEN:
  FOR PUTTING COMPLETE REWRITES BACK TOGETHER</a></h1>
This transformation is used to merge filepairs broken by diffcore-break, and not
  transformed into rename/copy by diffcore-rename, back into a single
  modification. This always runs when diffcore-break is used.
<p class="Pp">For the purpose of merging broken filepairs back, it uses a
    different &quot;extent of changes&quot; computation from the ones used by
    diffcore-break and diffcore-rename. It counts only the deletion from the
    original, and does not count insertion. If you removed only 10 lines from a
    100-line document, even if you added 910 new lines to make a new 1000-line
    document, you did not do a complete rewrite. diffcore-break breaks such a
    case in order to help diffcore-rename to consider such filepairs as
    candidate of rename/copy detection, but if filepairs broken that way were
    not matched with other filepairs to create rename/copy, then this
    transformation merges them back into the original
  &quot;modification&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">The &quot;extent of changes&quot; parameter can be tweaked from
    the default 80% (that is, unless more than 80% of the original material is
    deleted, the broken pairs are merged back into a single modification) by
    giving a second number to -B option, like these:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;-B50/60 (give 50% &quot;break score&quot; to
  diffcore-break, use 60% for diffcore-merge-broken).</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;-B/60 (the same as above, since diffcore-break
  defaults to 50%).</div>
<p class="Pp">Note that earlier implementation left a broken pair as a separate
    creation and deletion patches. This was an unnecessary hack and the latest
    implementation always merges all the broken pairs back into modifications,
    but the resulting patch output is formatted differently for easier review in
    case of such a complete rewrite by showing the entire contents of old
    version prefixed with <i>-</i>, followed by the entire contents of new
    version prefixed with <i>+</i>.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="DIFFCORE_-PICKAXE:_FOR_DETECTING_ADDITION/DELETION_OF_SPECIFIED_STRING"><a class="permalink" href="#DIFFCORE_-PICKAXE:_FOR_DETECTING_ADDITION/DELETION_OF_SPECIFIED_STRING">DIFFCORE-PICKAXE:
  FOR DETECTING ADDITION/DELETION OF SPECIFIED STRING</a></h1>
This transformation limits the set of filepairs to those that change specified
  strings between the preimage and the postimage in a certain way. -S&lt;block
  of text&gt; and -G&lt;regular expression&gt; options are used to specify
  different ways these strings are sought.
<p class="Pp">&quot;-S&lt;block of text&gt;&quot; detects filepairs whose
    preimage and postimage have different number of occurrences of the specified
    block of text. By definition, it will not detect in-file moves. Also, when a
    changeset moves a file wholesale without affecting the interesting string,
    diffcore-rename kicks in as usual, and <b>-S</b> omits the filepair (since
    the number of occurrences of that string didn&#x2019;t change in that
    rename-detected filepair). When used with <b>--pickaxe-regex</b>, treat the
    &lt;block of text&gt; as an extended POSIX regular expression to match,
    instead of a literal string.</p>
<p class="Pp">&quot;-G&lt;regular expression&gt;&quot; (mnemonic: grep) detects
    filepairs whose textual diff has an added or a deleted line that matches the
    given regular expression. This means that it will detect in-file (or what
    rename-detection considers the same file) moves, which is noise. The
    implementation runs diff twice and greps, and this can be quite expensive.
    To speed things up binary files without textconv filters will be
  ignored.</p>
<p class="Pp">When <b>-S</b> or <b>-G</b> are used without <b>--pickaxe-all</b>,
    only filepairs that match their respective criterion are kept in the output.
    When <b>--pickaxe-all</b> is used, if even one filepair matches their
    respective criterion in a changeset, the entire changeset is kept. This
    behavior is designed to make reviewing changes in the context of the whole
    changeset easier.</p>

  FOR SORTING THE OUTPUT BASED ON FILENAMES</a></h1>
This is used to reorder the filepairs according to the user&#x2019;s (or
  project&#x2019;s) taste, and is controlled by the -O option to the <i>git
  diff-*</i> commands.
<p class="Pp">This takes a text file each of whose lines is a shell glob
    pattern. Filepairs that match a glob pattern on an earlier line in the file
    are output before ones that match a later line, and filepairs that do not
    match any glob pattern are output last.</p>
<p class="Pp">As an example, a typical orderfile for the core Git probably would
    look like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">

  FOR CHANGING AT WHICH PATH OUTPUT STARTS</a></h1>
This transformation takes one pathname, and rotates the set of filepairs so that
  the filepair for the given pathname comes first, optionally discarding the
  paths that come before it. This is used to implement the <b>--skip-to</b> and
  the <b>--rotate-to</b> options. It is an error when the specified pathname is
  not in the set of filepairs, but it is not useful to error out when used with
  &quot;git log&quot; family of commands, because it is unreasonable to expect
  that a given path would be modified by each and every commit shown by the
  &quot;git log&quot; command. For this reason, when used with &quot;git
  log&quot;, the filepair that sorts the same as, or the first one that sorts
  after, the given pathname is where the output starts.
<p class="Pp">Use of this transformation combined with diffcore-order will
    produce unexpected results, as the input to this transformation is likely
    not sorted when diffcore-order is in effect.</p>
