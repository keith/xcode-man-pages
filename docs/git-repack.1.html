git-repack - Pack unpacked objects in a repository

<i>git repack</i> [-a] [-A] [-d] [-f] [-F] [-l] [-n] [-q] [-b] [--window=&lt;n&gt;] [--depth=&lt;n&gt;] [--threads=&lt;n&gt;] [--keep-pack=&lt;pack-name&gt;]

This command is used to combine all objects that do not currently reside in a
  &quot;pack&quot;, into a pack. It can also be used to re-organize existing
  packs into a single, more efficient pack.
<p class="Pp">A pack is a collection of objects, individually compressed, with
    delta compression applied, stored in a single file, with an associated index
    file.</p>
<p class="Pp">Packs are used to reduce the load on mirror systems, backup
    engines, disk storage, etc.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
-a
<div class="Bd-indent">Instead of incrementally packing the unpacked objects,
  pack everything referenced into a single pack. Especially useful when packing
  a repository that is used for private development. Use with <b>-d</b>. This
  will clean up the objects that <b>git prune</b> leaves behind, but <b>git fsck
  --full --dangling</b> shows as dangling.
<p class="Pp">Note that users fetching over dumb protocols will have to fetch
    the whole new pack in order to get any contained object, no matter how many
    other objects in that pack they already have locally.</p>
<p class="Pp">Promisor packfiles are repacked separately: if there are packfiles
    that have an associated &quot;.promisor&quot; file, these packfiles will be
    repacked into another separate pack, and an empty &quot;.promisor&quot; file
    corresponding to the new separate pack will be written.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">-A</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Same as <b>-a</b>, unless <b>-d</b> is used. Then any
  unreachable objects in a previous pack become loose, unpacked objects, instead
  of being left in the old pack. Unreachable objects are never intentionally
  added to a pack, even when repacking. This option prevents unreachable objects
  from being immediately deleted by way of being left in the old pack and then
  removed. Instead, the loose unreachable objects will be pruned according to
  normal expiry rules with the next <i>git gc</i> invocation. See
  <b>git-gc</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">-d</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">After packing, if the newly created packs make some
  existing packs redundant, remove the redundant packs. Also run <i>git
  prune-packed</i> to remove redundant loose object files.</div>
<p class="Pp">-l</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Pass the <b>--local</b> option to <i>git
  pack-objects</i>. See <b>git-pack-objects</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">-f</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Pass the <b>--no-reuse-delta</b> option to
  <b>git-pack-objects</b>, see <b>git-pack-objects</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">-F</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Pass the <b>--no-reuse-object</b> option to
  <b>git-pack-objects</b>, see <b>git-pack-objects</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">-q</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Pass the <b>-q</b> option to <i>git pack-objects</i>. See
  <b>git-pack-objects</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">-n</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Do not update the server information with <i>git
  update-server-info</i>. This option skips updating local catalog files needed
  to publish this repository (or a direct copy of it) over HTTP or FTP. See
  <b>git-update-server-info</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">--window=&lt;n&gt;, --depth=&lt;n&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">These two options affect how the objects contained in the
  pack are stored using delta compression. The objects are first internally
  sorted by type, size and optionally names and compared against the other
  objects within <b>--window</b> to see if using delta compression saves space.
  <b>--depth</b> limits the maximum delta depth; making it too deep affects the
  performance on the unpacker side, because delta data needs to be applied that
  many times to get to the necessary object.
<p class="Pp">The default value for --window is 10 and --depth is 50. The
    maximum depth is 4095.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--threads=&lt;n&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This option is passed through to <b>git
  pack-objects</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--window-memory=&lt;n&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This option provides an additional limit on top of
  <b>--window</b>; the window size will dynamically scale down so as to not take
  up more than <i>&lt;n&gt;</i> bytes in memory. This is useful in repositories
  with a mix of large and small objects to not run out of memory with a large
  window, but still be able to take advantage of the large window for the
  smaller objects. The size can be suffixed with &quot;k&quot;, &quot;m&quot;,
  or &quot;g&quot;. <b>--window-memory=0</b> makes memory usage unlimited. The
  default is taken from the <b>pack.windowMemory</b> configuration variable.
  Note that the actual memory usage will be the limit multiplied by the number
  of threads used by <b>git-pack-objects</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">--max-pack-size=&lt;n&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Maximum size of each output pack file. The size can be
  suffixed with &quot;k&quot;, &quot;m&quot;, or &quot;g&quot;. The minimum size
  allowed is limited to 1 MiB. If specified, multiple packfiles may be created,
  which also prevents the creation of a bitmap index. The default is unlimited,
  unless the config variable <b>pack.packSizeLimit</b> is set.</div>
<p class="Pp">-b, --write-bitmap-index</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Write a reachability bitmap index as part of the repack.
  This only makes sense when used with <b>-a</b> or <b>-A</b>, as the bitmaps
  must be able to refer to all reachable objects. This option overrides the
  setting of <b>repack.writeBitmaps</b>. This option has no effect if multiple
  packfiles are created.</div>
<p class="Pp">--pack-kept-objects</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Include objects in <b>.keep</b> files when repacking.
  Note that we still do not delete <b>.keep</b> packs after <b>pack-objects</b>
  finishes. This means that we may duplicate objects, but this makes the option
  safe to use when there are concurrent pushes or fetches. This option is
  generally only useful if you are writing bitmaps with <b>-b</b> or
  <b>repack.writeBitmaps</b>, as it ensures that the bitmapped packfile has the
  necessary objects.</div>
<p class="Pp">--keep-pack=&lt;pack-name&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Exclude the given pack from repacking. This is the
  equivalent of having <b>.keep</b> file on the pack. <b>&lt;pack-name&gt;</b>
  is the pack file name without leading directory (e.g. <b>pack-123.pack</b>).
  The option could be specified multiple times to keep multiple packs.</div>
<p class="Pp">--unpack-unreachable=&lt;when&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When loosening unreachable objects, do not bother
  loosening any objects older than <b>&lt;when&gt;</b>. This can be used to
  optimize out the write of any objects that would be immediately pruned by a
  follow-up <b>git prune</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">-k, --keep-unreachable</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When used with <b>-ad</b>, any unreachable objects from
  existing packs will be appended to the end of the packfile instead of being
  removed. In addition, any unreachable loose objects will be packed (and their
  loose counterparts removed).</div>
<p class="Pp">-i, --delta-islands</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Pass the <b>--delta-islands</b> option to
  <b>git-pack-objects</b>, see <b>git-pack-objects</b>(1).</div>

<h1 class="Sh" id="CONFIGURATION"><a class="permalink" href="#CONFIGURATION">CONFIGURATION</a></h1>
By default, the command passes <b>--delta-base-offset</b> option to <i>git
  pack-objects</i>; this typically results in slightly smaller packs, but the
  generated packs are incompatible with versions of Git older than version
  1.4.4. If you need to share your repository with such ancient Git versions,
  either directly or via the dumb http protocol, then you need to set the
  configuration variable <b>repack.UseDeltaBaseOffset</b> to &quot;false&quot;
  and repack. Access from old Git versions over the native protocol is
  unaffected by this option as the conversion is performed on the fly as needed
  in that case.
