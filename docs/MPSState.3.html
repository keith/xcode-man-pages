  Description</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">This depends on Metal Framework <b>A</b> semi-opaque data
    container for large storage in MPS CNN filters Some MPS CNN kernels produce
    additional information beyond a <b>MPSImage</b>. These may be pooling
    indices where the result came from, convolution weights, or other
    information not contained in the usual <b>MPSImage</b> result from a
    <b>MPSCNNKernel</b>. <b>A</b> <b>MPSState</b> object typically contains one
    or more expensive MTLResources such as textures or buffers to store this
    information. It provides a base class with interfaces for managing this
    storage. Child classes may add additional functionality specific to their
    contents.</p>
<p class="Pp">Some <b>MPSState</b> objects are temporary. Temporary state
    objects, like MPSTemporaryImages and Matrices, are for very short lived
    storage, perhaps just a few lines of code within the scope of a single
    MTLCommandBuffer. They are very efficient for storage, as several temporary
    objects can share the same memory over the course of a MTLCommandBuffer.
    This can improve both memory usage and time spent in the kernel wiring down
    memory and such. You may find that some large CNN tasks can not be computed
    without them, as non-temporary storage would simply take up too much
  memory.</p>
<p class="Pp">In exchange, the lifetime of the underlying storage in temporary
    <b>MPSState</b> objects needs to be carefully managed. ARC often waits until
    the end of scope to release objects. Temporary storage often needs to be
    released sooner than that. Consequently the lifetime of the data in the
    underlying MTLResources is managed by a readCount property. Each time a
    <b>MPSCNNKernel</b> reads a temporary <b>MPSState</b> object the readCount
    is automatically decremented. When it reaches zero, the underlying storage
    is recycled for use by other MPS temporary objects, and the data is becomes
    undefined. If you need to consume the data multiple times, you should set
    the readCount to a larger number to prevent the data from becomming
    undefined. You may set the readCount to 0 yourself to return the storage to
    MPS, if for any reason, you realize that the <b>MPSState</b> object will no
    longer be used.</p>
<p class="Pp">The contents of a temporary <b>MPSState</b> object are only valid
    from creation to the time the readCount reaches 0. The data is only valid
    for the MTLCommandBuffer on which it was created. Non-temporary
    <b>MPSState</b> objects are valid on any MTLCommandBuffer on the same device
    until they are released.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
<br/>
            Finally, temporary MPSState objects are complicated to use with blit encoders.
<br/>
            Your application should assume that the temporary MPSState is backed by a MTLHeap,
<br/>
            and consequently needs a MTLFence to ensure that compute command encoders and other
<br/>
            encoders do not trip over one another with heap based memory. MPS will almost never
<br/>
            use a blit encoder for this reason. If you do need one, then you will need to make
<br/>
            a new compute encoder to block on whatever previous compute encoder last used the
<br/>
            heap block. (MPS will not tell you who previously used the heap block. That encoder
<br/>
            is almost certainly long dead anyway.) If concurrent encoders are involved, then a
<br/>
            barrier might be needed. Within that compute encoder, you will call -updateFence.
<br/>
            End the compute encoder, make a blit encoder wait for the fence, do the blit, update
<br/>
            a new fence, then make a new compute encoder, wait for the second fence, then you
<br/>
            can continue. Possibly the second do-nothing compute encoder needs to be ended so
<br/>
            MPS can be called. Frankly, we don't bother with blit encoders and just write a compute
<br/>
            operation for copy / clear as needed, or better yet find a way to eliminate the
<br/>
            clear / copy pass so we don't have to pay for it. Your application needs to use
<br/>
            temporary MPSStates and MPSTemporaryImages. Memory costs skyrocket, otherwise.
<br/>
            It is the blit encoder that is hopefully optional. Note: the most common use of a
<br/>
            blit encoder, -synchronizeResource: can not encounter this problem because temporary
<br/>
            images and states live in GPU private memory and can not be read by the CPU..fi</pre>

<p class="Pp">Except when -initWithResource: is used, most MPSStates are
