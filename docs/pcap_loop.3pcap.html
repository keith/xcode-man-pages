<b>pcap_loop()</b> processes packets from a live capture or ``savefile'' until
  <i>cnt</i> packets are processed, the end of the ``savefile'' is reached when
  reading from a ``savefile'', <b>pcap_breakloop()</b> is called, or an error
  occurs. It does <b>not</b> return when live read timeouts occur. A value of -1
  or 0 for <i>cnt</i> is equivalent to infinity, so that packets are processed
  until another ending condition occurs.
<p class="Pp"><b>pcap_dispatch()</b> processes packets from a live capture or
    ``savefile'' until <i>cnt</i> packets are processed, the end of the current
    bufferful of packets is reached when doing a live capture, the end of the
    ``savefile'' is reached when reading from a ``savefile'',
    <b>pcap_breakloop()</b> is called, or an error occurs. Thus, when doing a
    live capture, <i>cnt</i> is the maximum number of packets to process before
    returning, but is not a minimum number; when reading a live capture, only
    one bufferful of packets is read at a time, so fewer than <i>cnt</i> packets
    may be processed. A value of -1 or 0 for <i>cnt</i> causes all the packets
    received in one buffer to be processed when reading a live capture, and
    causes all the packets in the file to be processed when reading a
    ``savefile''.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that, when doing a live capture on some platforms, if the
    read timeout expires when there are no packets available,
    <b>pcap_dispatch()</b> will return 0, even when not in non-blocking mode, as
    there are no packets to process. Applications should be prepared for this to
    happen, but must not rely on it happening.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b></b><b>(In older versions of libpcap, the behavior when</b>
    <b></b> <i>cnt</i><b></b> <b>was 0 was undefined; different platforms and
    devices behaved</b> <b>differently, so code that must work with older
    versions of libpcap</b> <b>should use -1, not 0, as the value of</b>
    <b></b><i>cnt</i><b>.)</b></p>
<p class="Pp"><i>callback</i> specifies a <i>pcap_handler</i> routine to be
    called with three arguments: a <i>u_char</i> pointer which is passed in the
    <i>user</i> argument to <b>pcap_loop()</b> or <b>pcap_dispatch()</b>, a
    <i>const struct pcap_pkthdr</i> pointer pointing to the packet time stamp
    and lengths, and a <i>const u_char</i> pointer to the first <b>caplen</b>
    (as given in the <i>struct pcap_pkthdr</i> a pointer to which is passed to
    the callback routine) bytes of data from the packet. The <i>struct
    pcap_pkthdr</i> and the packet data are not to be freed by the callback
    routine, and are not guaranteed to be valid after the callback routine
    returns; if the code needs them to be valid after the callback, it must make
    a copy of them.</p>
<p class="Pp">The bytes of data from the packet begin with a link-layer header.
    The format of the link-layer header is indicated by the return value of the
    <b>pcap_datalink()</b> routine when handed the <b>pcap_t</b> value also
    passed to <b>pcap_loop()</b> or <b>pcap_dispatch()</b>.
    <i>http://www.tcpdump.org/linktypes.html</i> lists the values
    <b>pcap_datalink()</b> can return and describes the packet formats that
    correspond to those values. The value it returns will be valid for all
    packets received unless and until <b>pcap_set_datalink()</b> is called;
    after a successful call to <b>pcap_set_datalink()</b>, all subsequent
    packets will have a link-layer header of the type specified by the
    link-layer header type value passed to <b>pcap_set_datalink()</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Do <b>NOT</b> assume that the packets for a given capture or
    ``savefile`` will have any given link-layer header type, such as
    <b>DLT_EN10MB</b> for Ethernet. For example, the &quot;any&quot; device on
    Linux will have a link-layer header type of <b>DLT_LINUX_SLL</b> even if all
    devices on the system at the time the &quot;any&quot; device is opened have
    some other data link type, such as <b>DLT_EN10MB</b> for Ethernet.</p>

  VALUE</a></h1>
<b>pcap_loop()</b> returns 0 if <i>cnt</i> is exhausted or if, when reading from
  a ``savefile'', no more packets are available. It returns -1 if an error
  occurs or -2 if the loop terminated due to a call to <b>pcap_breakloop()</b>
  before any packets were processed. It does <b>not</b> return when live read
  timeouts occur; instead, it attempts to read more packets.
<p class="Pp"><b>pcap_dispatch()</b> returns the number of packets processed on
    success; this can be 0 if no packets were read from a live capture (if, for
    example, they were discarded because they didn't pass the packet filter, or
    if, on platforms that support a read timeout that starts before any packets
    arrive, the timeout expires before any packets arrive, or if the file
    descriptor for the capture device is in non-blocking mode and no packets
    were available to be read) or if no more packets are available in a
    ``savefile.'' It returns -1 if an error occurs or -2 if the loop terminated
    due to a call to <b>pcap_breakloop()</b> before any packets were processed.
    <b></b><b>If your application uses pcap_breakloop(),</b> <b>make sure that
    you explicitly check for -1 and -2, rather than just</b> <b>checking for a
    return value &lt; 0.</b></p>
<p class="Pp">If -1 is returned, <b>pcap_geterr()</b> or <b>pcap_perror()</b>
    may be called with <i>p</i> as an argument to fetch or display the error
    text.</p>
