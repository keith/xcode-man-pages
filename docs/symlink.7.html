<h1 class="Sh" id="SYMBOLIC_LINK_HANDLING"><a class="permalink" href="#SYMBOLIC_LINK_HANDLING">SYMBOLIC
  LINK HANDLING</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Symbolic links are files that act as pointers to other files. To
    understand their behavior, you must first understand how hard links work. A
    hard link to a file is indistinguishable from the original file because it
    is a reference to the object underlying the original file name. Changes to a
    file are independent of the name used to reference the file. Hard links may
    not refer to directories and may not reference files on different file
    systems. A symbolic link contains the name of the file to which it is
    linked, i.e., it is a pointer to another name, and not to an underlying
    object. For this reason, symbolic links may reference directories and may
    span file systems.</p>
<p class="Pp">Because a symbolic link and its referenced object coexist in the
    file system name space, confusion can arise in distinguishing between the
    link itself and the referenced object. Historically, commands and system
    calls have adopted their own link following conventions in a somewhat ad-hoc
    fashion. Rules for more a uniform approach, as they are implemented in this
    system, are outlined here. It is important that local applications conform
    to these rules, too, so that the user interface can be as consistent as
    possible.</p>
<p class="Pp">Symbolic links are handled either by operating on the link itself,
    or by operating on the object referenced by the link. In the latter case, an
    application or system call is said to &#x201C;follow&#x201D; the link.
    Symbolic links may reference other symbolic links, in which case the links
    are dereferenced until an object that is not a symbolic link is found, a
    symbolic link which references a file which does not exist is found, or a
    loop is detected. (Loop detection is done by placing an upper limit on the
    number of links that may be followed, and an error results if this limit is
    exceeded.)</p>
<p class="Pp">There are three separate areas that need to be discussed. They are
    as follows:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<ol class="Bl-enum Bd-indent Bl-compact">
  <li>Symbolic links used as file name arguments for system calls.</li>
  <li>Symbolic links specified as command line arguments to utilities that are
      not traversing a file tree.</li>
  <li>Symbolic links encountered by utilities that are traversing a file tree
      (either specified on the command line or encountered as part of the file
      hierarchy walk).</li>
</ol>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="System_calls."><a class="permalink" href="#System_calls.">System
  calls.</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The first area is symbolic links used as file name arguments for
    system calls.</p>
<p class="Pp">Except as noted below, all system calls follow symbolic links. For
    example, if there were a symbolic link
    &#x201C;<code class="Li">slink</code>&#x201D; which pointed to a file named
    &#x201C;<code class="Li">afile</code>&#x201D;, the system call
    &#x201C;<code class="Li">open(&quot;slink&quot; ...)</code>&#x201D; would
    return a file descriptor to the file &#x201C;afile&#x201D;.</p>
<p class="Pp">There are twelve system calls that do not follow links, and which
    operate on the symbolic link itself. They are:
    <a class="Xr">lchflags(2)</a>, <a class="Xr">lchmod(2)</a>,
    <a class="Xr">lchown(2)</a>, <a class="Xr">lstat(2)</a>,
    <a class="Xr">lutimes(3)</a>, <a class="Xr">readlink(2)</a>,
    <a class="Xr">readlinkat(2)</a>, <a class="Xr">rename(2)</a>,
    <a class="Xr">renameat(2)</a>, <a class="Xr">rmdir(2)</a>,
    <a class="Xr">unlink(2)</a>, and <a class="Xr">unlinkat(2)</a>. Because
    <a class="Xr">remove(3)</a> is an alias for <a class="Xr">unlink(2)</a>, it
    also does not follow symbolic links. When <a class="Xr">rmdir(2)</a> or
    <a class="Xr">unlinkat(2)</a> with the <code class="Dv">AT_REMOVEDIR</code>
    flag is applied to a symbolic link, it fails with the error
    <code class="Er">ENOTDIR</code>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <a class="Xr">linkat(2)</a> system call does not follow
    symbolic links unless given the <code class="Dv">AT_SYMLINK_FOLLOW</code>
    flag.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following system calls follow symbolic links unless given the
    <code class="Dv">AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW</code> flag:
    <a class="Xr">chflagsat(2)</a>, <a class="Xr">fchmodat(2)</a>,
    <a class="Xr">fchownat(2)</a>, <a class="Xr">fstatat(2)</a> and
    <a class="Xr">utimensat(2)</a>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The owner and group of an existing symbolic link can be changed by
    means of the <a class="Xr">lchown(2)</a> system call. The flags, access
    permissions, owner/group and modification time of an existing symbolic link
    can be changed by means of the <a class="Xr">lchflags(2)</a>,
    <a class="Xr">lchmod(2)</a>, <a class="Xr">lchown(2)</a>, and
    <a class="Xr">lutimes(3)</a> system calls, respectively. Of these, only the
    flags and ownership are used by the system; the access permissions are
    ignored.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Ux">4.4BSD</span> system differs from historical
    <span class="Ux">4BSD</span> systems in that the system call
    <a class="Xr">chown(2)</a> has been changed to follow symbolic links. The
    <a class="Xr">lchown(2)</a> system call was added later when the limitations
    of the new <a class="Xr">chown(2)</a> became apparent.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Commands_not_traversing_a_file_tree."><a class="permalink" href="#Commands_not_traversing_a_file_tree.">Commands
  not traversing a file tree.</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The second area is symbolic links, specified as command line file
    name arguments, to commands which are not traversing a file tree.</p>
<p class="Pp">Except as noted below, commands follow symbolic links named as
    command line arguments. For example, if there were a symbolic link
    &#x201C;<code class="Li">slink</code>&#x201D; which pointed to a file named
    &#x201C;<code class="Li">afile</code>&#x201D;, the command
    &#x201C;<code class="Li">cat slink</code>&#x201D; would display the contents
    of the file &#x201C;<code class="Li">afile</code>&#x201D;.</p>
<p class="Pp">It is important to realize that this rule includes commands which
    may optionally traverse file trees, e.g. the command
    &#x201C;<code class="Li">chown file</code>&#x201D; is included in this rule,
    while the command &#x201C;<code class="Li">chown -R file</code>&#x201D; is
    not. (The latter is described in the third area, below.)</p>
<p class="Pp">If it is explicitly intended that the command operate on the
    symbolic link instead of following the symbolic link, e.g., it is desired
    that &#x201C;<code class="Li">chown slink</code>&#x201D; change the
    ownership of the file that &#x201C;<code class="Li">slink</code>&#x201D; is,
    whether it is a symbolic link or not, the <code class="Fl">-h</code> option
    should be used. In the above example, &#x201C;<code class="Li">chown root
    slink</code>&#x201D; would change the ownership of the file referenced by
    &#x201C;<code class="Li">slink</code>&#x201D;, while
    &#x201C;<code class="Li">chown -h root slink</code>&#x201D; would change the
    ownership of &#x201C;<code class="Li">slink</code>&#x201D; itself.</p>
<p class="Pp">There are five exceptions to this rule. The
    <a class="Xr">mv(1)</a> and <a class="Xr">rm(1)</a> commands do not follow
    symbolic links named as arguments, but respectively attempt to rename and
    delete them. (Note, if the symbolic link references a file via a relative
    path, moving it to another directory may very well cause it to stop working,
    since the path may no longer be correct.)</p>
<p class="Pp">The <a class="Xr">ls(1)</a> command is also an exception to this
    rule. For compatibility with historic systems (when
    <code class="Nm">ls</code> is not doing a tree walk, i.e., the
    <code class="Fl">-R</code> option is not specified), the
    <code class="Nm">ls</code> command follows symbolic links named as arguments
    if the <code class="Fl">-H</code> or <code class="Fl">-L</code> option is
    specified, or if the <code class="Fl">-F</code>, <code class="Fl">-d</code>
    or <code class="Fl">-l</code> options are not specified. (The
    <code class="Nm">ls</code> command is the only command where the
    <code class="Fl">-H</code> and <code class="Fl">-L</code> options affect its
    behavior even though it is not doing a walk of a file tree.)</p>
<p class="Pp">The <a class="Xr">file(1)</a> and <a class="Xr">stat(1)</a>
    commands are also exceptions to this rule. These commands do not follow
    symbolic links named as argument by default, but do follow symbolic links
    named as argument if the <code class="Fl">-L</code> option is specified.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Ux">4.4BSD</span> system differs from historical
    <span class="Ux">4BSD</span> systems in that the
    <code class="Nm">chown</code> and <code class="Nm">chgrp</code> commands
    follow symbolic links specified on the command line.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Commands_traversing_a_file_tree."><a class="permalink" href="#Commands_traversing_a_file_tree.">Commands
  traversing a file tree.</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The following commands either optionally or always traverse file
    trees: <a class="Xr">chflags(1)</a>, <a class="Xr">chgrp(1)</a>,
    <a class="Xr">chmod(1)</a>, <a class="Xr">cp(1)</a>,
    <a class="Xr">du(1)</a>, <a class="Xr">find(1)</a>, <a class="Xr">ls(1)</a>,
    <a class="Xr">pax(1)</a>, <a class="Xr">rm(1)</a>, <a class="Xr">tar(1)</a>
    and <a class="Xr">chown(8)</a>.</p>
<p class="Pp">It is important to realize that the following rules apply equally
    to symbolic links encountered during the file tree traversal and symbolic
    links listed as command line arguments.</p>
<p class="Pp">The first rule applies to symbolic links that reference files that
    are not of type directory. Operations that apply to symbolic links are
    performed on the links themselves, but otherwise the links are ignored.</p>
<p class="Pp">The command &#x201C;<code class="Li">rm -r slink
    directory</code>&#x201D; will remove
    &#x201C;<code class="Li">slink</code>&#x201D;, as well as any symbolic links
    encountered in the tree traversal of
    &#x201C;<code class="Li">directory</code>&#x201D;, because symbolic links
    may be removed. In no case will <code class="Nm">rm</code> affect the file
    which &#x201C;<code class="Li">slink</code>&#x201D; references in any
  way.</p>
<p class="Pp">The second rule applies to symbolic links that reference files of
    type directory. Symbolic links which reference files of type directory are
    never &#x201C;followed&#x201D; by default. This is often referred to as a
    &#x201C;physical&#x201D; walk, as opposed to a &#x201C;logical&#x201D; walk
    (where symbolic links referencing directories are followed).</p>
<p class="Pp">As consistently as possible, you can make commands doing a file
    tree walk follow any symbolic links named on the command line, regardless of
    the type of file they reference, by specifying the
    <code class="Fl">-H</code> (for &#x201C;half-logical&#x201D;) flag. This
    flag is intended to make the command line name space look like the logical
    name space. (Note, for commands that do not always do file tree traversals,
    the <code class="Fl">-H</code> flag will be ignored if the
    <code class="Fl">-R</code> flag is not also specified.)</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, the command &#x201C;<code class="Li">chown -HR user
    slink</code>&#x201D; will traverse the file hierarchy rooted in the file
    pointed to by &#x201C;<code class="Li">slink</code>&#x201D;. Note, the
    <code class="Fl">-H</code> is not the same as the previously discussed
    <code class="Fl">-h</code> flag. The <code class="Fl">-H</code> flag causes
    symbolic links specified on the command line to be dereferenced both for the
    purposes of the action to be performed and the tree walk, and it is as if
    the user had specified the name of the file to which the symbolic link
    pointed.</p>
<p class="Pp">As consistently as possible, you can make commands doing a file
    tree walk follow any symbolic links named on the command line, as well as
    any symbolic links encountered during the traversal, regardless of the type
    of file they reference, by specifying the <code class="Fl">-L</code> (for
    &#x201C;logical&#x201D;) flag. This flag is intended to make the entire name
    space look like the logical name space. (Note, for commands that do not
    always do file tree traversals, the <code class="Fl">-L</code> flag will be
    ignored if the <code class="Fl">-R</code> flag is not also specified.)</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, the command &#x201C;<code class="Li">chown -LR user
    slink</code>&#x201D; will change the owner of the file referenced by
    &#x201C;<code class="Li">slink</code>&#x201D;. If
    &#x201C;<code class="Li">slink</code>&#x201D; references a directory,
    <code class="Nm">chown</code> will traverse the file hierarchy rooted in the
    directory that it references. In addition, if any symbolic links are
    encountered in any file tree that <code class="Nm">chown</code> traverses,
    they will be treated in the same fashion as
    &#x201C;<code class="Li">slink</code>&#x201D;.</p>
<p class="Pp">As consistently as possible, you can specify the default behavior
    by specifying the <code class="Fl">-P</code> (for &#x201C;physical&#x201D;)
    flag. This flag is intended to make the entire name space look like the
    physical name space.</p>
<p class="Pp">For commands that do not by default do file tree traversals, the
    <code class="Fl">-H</code>, <code class="Fl">-L</code> and
    <code class="Fl">-P</code> flags are ignored if the
    <code class="Fl">-R</code> flag is not also specified. In addition, you may
    specify the <code class="Fl">-H</code>, <code class="Fl">-L</code> and
    <code class="Fl">-P</code> options more than once; the last one specified
    determines the command's behavior. This is intended to permit you to alias
    commands to behave one way or the other, and then override that behavior on
    the command line.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <a class="Xr">ls(1)</a> and <a class="Xr">rm(1)</a> commands
    have exceptions to these rules. The <code class="Nm">rm</code> command
    operates on the symbolic link, and not the file it references, and therefore
    never follows a symbolic link. The <code class="Nm">rm</code> command does
    not support the <code class="Fl">-H</code>, <code class="Fl">-L</code> or
    <code class="Fl">-P</code> options.</p>
<p class="Pp">To maintain compatibility with historic systems, the
    <code class="Nm">ls</code> command acts a little differently. If you do not
    specify the <code class="Fl">-F</code>, <code class="Fl">-d</code> or
    <code class="Fl">-l</code> options, <code class="Nm">ls</code> will follow
    symbolic links specified on the command line. If the
    <code class="Fl">-L</code> flag is specified, <code class="Nm">ls</code>
    follows all symbolic links, regardless of their type, whether specified on
    the command line or encountered in the tree walk.</p>
