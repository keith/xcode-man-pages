<span class="Li">&quot;Tie::File&quot;</span> represents a regular text file as
  a Perl array. Each element in the array corresponds to a record in the file.
  The first line of the file is element 0 of the array; the second line is
  element 1, and so on.
<p class="Pp">The file is <i>not</i> loaded into memory, so this will work even
    for gigantic files.</p>
<p class="Pp">Changes to the array are reflected in the file immediately.</p>

What is a 'record'? By default, the meaning is the same as for the
  <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;...&gt;&quot;</span> operator: It's a string
  terminated by <span class="Li">$/</span>, which is probably
  <span class="Li">&quot;\n&quot;</span>. (Minor exception: on DOS and Win32
  systems, a 'record' is a string terminated by
  <span class="Li">&quot;\r\n&quot;</span>.) You may change the definition of
  &quot;record&quot; by supplying the <span class="Li">&quot;recsep&quot;</span>
  option in the <span class="Li">&quot;tie&quot;</span> call:
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
        tie @array, 'Tie::File', $file, recsep =&gt; 'es';
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This says that records are delimited by the string
    <span class="Li">&quot;es&quot;</span>. If the file contained the following
    data:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
        Curse these pesky flies!\n
</pre>
<p class="Pp">then the <span class="Li">@array</span> would appear to have four
    elements:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
        &quot;Curse th&quot;
        &quot;e p&quot;
        &quot;ky fli&quot;
        &quot;!\n&quot;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">An undefined value is not permitted as a record separator. Perl's
    special &quot;paragraph mode&quot; semantics (a la <span class="Li">&quot;$/
    = &quot;&quot;&quot;</span>) are not emulated.</p>
<p class="Pp">Records read from the tied array do not have the record separator
    string on the end; this is to allow</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
        $array[17] .= &quot;extra&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">to work as expected.</p>
<p class="Pp">(See &quot;autochomp&quot;, below.) Records stored into the array
    will have the record separator string appended before they are written to
    the file, if they don't have one already. For example, if the record
    separator string is <span class="Li">&quot;\n&quot;</span>, then the
    following two lines do exactly the same thing:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
        $array[17] = &quot;Cherry pie&quot;;
        $array[17] = &quot;Cherry pie\n&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The result is that the contents of line 17 of the file will be
    replaced with &quot;Cherry pie&quot;; a newline character will separate line
    17 from line 18. This means that this code will do nothing:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
        chomp $array[17];
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Because the <span class="Li">&quot;chomp&quot;</span>ed value will
    have the separator reattached when it is written back to the file. There is
    no way to create a file whose trailing record separator string is
  missing.</p>
<p class="Pp">Inserting records that <i>contain</i> the record separator string
    is not supported by this module. It will probably produce a reasonable
    result, but what this result will be may change in a future version. Use
    'splice' to insert records or to replace one record with several.</p>

Normally, the specified file will be opened for read and write access, and will
  be created if it does not exist. (That is, the flags
  <span class="Li">&quot;O_RDWR | O_CREAT&quot;</span> are supplied in the
  <span class="Li">&quot;open&quot;</span> call.) If you want to change this,
  you may supply alternative flags in the
  <span class="Li">&quot;mode&quot;</span> option. See Fcntl for a listing of
  available flags. For example:
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
        # open the file if it exists, but fail if it does not exist
        use Fcntl 'O_RDWR';

        # create the file if it does not exist

        tie @array, 'Tie::File', $file, mode =&gt; O_RDWR | O_CREAT;

        # open an existing file in read-only mode
        use Fcntl 'O_RDONLY';
        tie @array, 'Tie::File', $file, mode =&gt; O_RDONLY;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Opening the data file in write-only or append mode is not
    supported.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="_memory_"><a class="permalink" href="#_memory_">&quot;memory&quot;</a></h2>
This is an upper limit on the amount of memory that
  <span class="Li">&quot;Tie::File&quot;</span> will consume at any time while
  managing the file. This is used for two things: managing the <i>read cache</i>
  and managing the <i>deferred write</i> <i>buffer</i>.
<p class="Pp">Records read in from the file are cached, to avoid having to
    re-read them repeatedly. If you read the same record twice, the first time
    it will be stored in memory, and the second time it will be fetched from the
    <i>read cache</i>. The amount of data in the read cache will not exceed the
    value you specified for <span class="Li">&quot;memory&quot;</span>. If
    <span class="Li">&quot;Tie::File&quot;</span> wants to cache a new record,
    but the read cache is full, it will make room by expiring the least-recently
    visited records from the read cache.</p>
<p class="Pp">The default memory limit is 2Mib. You can adjust the maximum read
    cache size by supplying the <span class="Li">&quot;memory&quot;</span>
    option. The argument is the desired cache size, in bytes.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
 # I have a lot of memory, so use a large cache to speed up access
 tie @array, 'Tie::File', $file, memory =&gt; 20_000_000;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Setting the memory limit to 0 will inhibit caching; records will
    be fetched from disk every time you examine them.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;memory&quot;</span> value is not an
    absolute or exact limit on the memory used.
    <span class="Li">&quot;Tie::File&quot;</span> objects contains some
    structures besides the read cache and the deferred write buffer, whose sizes
    are not charged against <span class="Li">&quot;memory&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The cache itself consumes about 310 bytes per cached record, so if
    your file has many short records, you may want to decrease the cache memory
    limit, or else the cache overhead may exceed the size of the cached
  data.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="_dw_size_"><a class="permalink" href="#_dw_size_">&quot;dw_size&quot;</a></h2>
(This is an advanced feature. Skip this section on first reading.)
<p class="Pp">If you use deferred writing (See &quot;Deferred Writing&quot;,
    below) then data you write into the array will not be written directly to
    the file; instead, it will be saved in the <i>deferred write buffer</i> to
    be written out later. Data in the deferred write buffer is also charged
    against the memory limit you set with the
    <span class="Li">&quot;memory&quot;</span> option.</p>
<p class="Pp">You may set the <span class="Li">&quot;dw_size&quot;</span> option
    to limit the amount of data that can be saved in the deferred write buffer.
    This limit may not exceed the total memory limit. For example, if you set
    <span class="Li">&quot;dw_size&quot;</span> to 1000 and
    <span class="Li">&quot;memory&quot;</span> to 2500, that means that no more
    than 1000 bytes of deferred writes will be saved up. The space available for
    the read cache will vary, but it will always be at least 1500 bytes (if the
    deferred write buffer is full) and it could grow as large as 2500 bytes (if
    the deferred write buffer is empty.)</p>
<p class="Pp">If you don't specify a
    <span class="Li">&quot;dw_size&quot;</span>, it defaults to the entire
    memory limit.</p>

<pre>
        $o-&gt;flock(MODE)
</pre>
<p class="Pp">will lock the tied file. <span class="Li">&quot;MODE&quot;</span>
    has the same meaning as the second argument to the Perl built-in
    <span class="Li">&quot;flock&quot;</span> function; for example
    <span class="Li">&quot;LOCK_SH&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;LOCK_EX | LOCK_NB&quot;</span>. (These constants are
    provided by the <span class="Li">&quot;use Fcntl ':flock'&quot;</span>
    declaration.)</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;MODE&quot;</span> is optional; the default
    is <span class="Li">&quot;LOCK_EX&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;Tie::File&quot;</span> maintains an
    internal table of the byte offset of each record it has seen in the
  file.</p>
<p class="Pp">When you use <span class="Li">&quot;flock&quot;</span> to lock the
    file, <span class="Li">&quot;Tie::File&quot;</span> assumes that the read
    cache is no longer trustworthy, because another process might have modified
    the file since the last time it was read. Therefore, a successful call to
    <span class="Li">&quot;flock&quot;</span> discards the contents of the read
    cache and the internal record offset table.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;Tie::File&quot;</span> promises that the
    following sequence of operations will be safe:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
        my $o = tie @array, &quot;Tie::File&quot;, $filename;
        $o-&gt;flock;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">In particular, <span class="Li">&quot;Tie::File&quot;</span> will
    <i>not</i> read or write the file during the
    <span class="Li">&quot;tie&quot;</span> call. (Exception: Using
    <span class="Li">&quot;mode =&gt; O_TRUNC&quot;</span> will, of course,
    erase the file during the <span class="Li">&quot;tie&quot;</span> call. If
    you want to do this safely, then open the file without
    <span class="Li">&quot;O_TRUNC&quot;</span>, lock the file, and use
    <span class="Li">&quot;@array = ()&quot;</span>.)</p>
<p class="Pp">The best way to unlock a file is to discard the object and untie
    the array. It is probably unsafe to unlock the file without also untying it,
    because if you do, changes may remain unwritten inside the object. That is
    why there is no shortcut for unlocking. If you really want to unlock the
    file prematurely, you know what to do; if you don't know what to do, then
    don't do it.</p>
<p class="Pp">All the usual warnings about file locking apply here. In
    particular, note that file locking in Perl is <b>advisory</b>, which means
    that holding a lock will not prevent anyone else from reading, writing, or
    erasing the file; it only prevents them from getting another lock at the
    same time. Locks are analogous to green traffic lights: If you have a green
    light, that does not prevent the idiot coming the other way from plowing
    into you sideways; it merely guarantees to you that the idiot does not also
    have a green light at the same time.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="Deferred_Writing"><a class="permalink" href="#Deferred_Writing">Deferred
  Writing</a></h1>
(This is an advanced feature. Skip this section on first reading.)
<p class="Pp">Normally, modifying a
    <span class="Li">&quot;Tie::File&quot;</span> array writes to the underlying
    file immediately. Every assignment like <span class="Li">&quot;$a[3] =
    ...&quot;</span> rewrites as much of the file as is necessary; typically,
    everything from line 3 through the end will need to be rewritten. This is
    the simplest and most transparent behavior. Performance even for large files
    is reasonably good.</p>
<p class="Pp">However, under some circumstances, this behavior may be
    excessively slow. For example, suppose you have a million-record file, and
    you want to do:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
        for (@FILE) {
          $_ = &quot;&gt; $_&quot;;
        }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The first time through the loop, you will rewrite the entire file,
    from line 0 through the end. The second time through the loop, you will
    rewrite the entire file from line 1 through the end. The third time through
    the loop, you will rewrite the entire file from line 2 to the end. And so
    on.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the performance in such cases is unacceptable, you may defer
    the actual writing, and then have it done all at once. The following loop
    will perform much better for large files:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
        (tied @a)-&gt;defer;
        for (@a) {
          $_ = &quot;&gt; $_&quot;;
        }
        (tied @a)-&gt;flush;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If <span class="Li">&quot;Tie::File&quot;</span>'s memory limit is
    large enough, all the writing will done in memory. Then, when you call
    <span class="Li">&quot;-&gt;flush&quot;</span>, the entire file will be
    rewritten in a single pass.</p>
<p class="Pp">(Actually, the preceding discussion is something of a fib. You
    don't need to enable deferred writing to get good performance for this
    common case, because <span class="Li">&quot;Tie::File&quot;</span> will do
    it for you automatically unless you specifically tell it not to. See
    &quot;Autodeferring&quot;, below.)</p>
<p class="Pp">Calling <span class="Li">&quot;-&gt;flush&quot;</span> returns the
    array to immediate-write mode. If you wish to discard the deferred writes,
    you may call <span class="Li">&quot;-&gt;discard&quot;</span> instead of
    <span class="Li">&quot;-&gt;flush&quot;</span>. Note that in some cases,
    some of the data will have been written already, and it will be too late for
    <span class="Li">&quot;-&gt;discard&quot;</span> to discard all the changes.
    Support for <span class="Li">&quot;-&gt;discard&quot;</span> may be
    withdrawn in a future version of
    <span class="Li">&quot;Tie::File&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Deferred writes are cached in memory up to the limit specified by
    the <span class="Li">&quot;dw_size&quot;</span> option (see above). If the
    deferred-write buffer is full and you try to write still more deferred data,
    the buffer will be flushed. All buffered data will be written immediately,
    the buffer will be emptied, and the now-empty space will be used for future
    deferred writes.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the deferred-write buffer isn't yet full, but the total size of
    the buffer and the read cache would exceed the
    <span class="Li">&quot;memory&quot;</span> limit, the oldest records will be
    expired from the read cache until the total size is under the limit.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;push&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;pop&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;shift&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;unshift&quot;</span>, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;splice&quot;</span> cannot be deferred. When you
    perform one of these operations, any deferred data is written to the file
    and the operation is performed immediately. This may change in a future
    version.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you resize the array with deferred writing enabled, the file
    will be resized immediately, but deferred records will not be written. This
    has a surprising consequence: <span class="Li">&quot;@a = (...)&quot;</span>
    erases the file immediately, but the writing of the actual data is deferred.
    This might be a bug. If it is a bug, it will be fixed in a future
  version.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Autodeferring"><a class="permalink" href="#Autodeferring">Autodeferring</a></h2>
<span class="Li">&quot;Tie::File&quot;</span> tries to guess when deferred
  writing might be helpful, and to turn it on and off automatically.
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
        for (@a) {
          $_ = &quot;&gt; $_&quot;;
        }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">In this example, only the first two assignments will be done
    immediately; after this, all the changes to the file will be deferred up to
    the user-specified memory limit.</p>
<p class="Pp">You should usually be able to ignore this and just use the module
    without thinking about deferring. However, special applications may require
    fine control over which writes are deferred, or may require that all writes
    be immediate. To disable the autodeferment feature, use</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
        (tied @o)-&gt;autodefer(0);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">or</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
        tie @array, 'Tie::File', $file, autodefer =&gt; 0;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Similarly, <span class="Li">&quot;-&gt;autodefer(1)&quot;</span>
    re-enables autodeferment, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;-&gt;autodefer()&quot;</span> recovers the current
    value of the autodefer setting.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="CONCURRENT_ACCESS_TO_FILES"><a class="permalink" href="#CONCURRENT_ACCESS_TO_FILES">CONCURRENT
  ACCESS TO FILES</a></h1>
Caching and deferred writing are inappropriate if you want the same file to be
  accessed simultaneously from more than one process. Other optimizations
  performed internally by this module are also incompatible with concurrent
  access. A future version of this module will support a
  <span class="Li">&quot;concurrent =&gt; 1&quot;</span> option that enables
  safe concurrent access.
<p class="Pp">Previous versions of this documentation suggested using
    <span class="Li">&quot;memory</span> <span class="Li">=&gt; 0&quot;</span>
    for safe concurrent access. This was mistaken. Tie::File will not support
    safe concurrent access before version 0.96.</p>

(That's Latin for 'warnings'.)
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Reasonable effort was made to make this module efficient. Nevertheless,
      changing the size of a record in the middle of a large file will always be
      fairly slow, because everything after the new record must be moved.</li>
  <li>The behavior of tied arrays is not precisely the same as for regular
      arrays. For example:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
        # This DOES print &quot;How unusual!&quot;
        undef $a[10];  print &quot;How unusual!\n&quot; if defined $a[10];
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span>-ing a
        <span class="Li">&quot;Tie::File&quot;</span> array element just blanks
        out the corresponding record in the file. When you read it back again,
        you'll get the empty string, so the
        supposedly-<span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span>'ed value will be
        defined. Similarly, if you have
        <span class="Li">&quot;autochomp&quot;</span> disabled, then</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
        # This DOES print &quot;How unusual!&quot; if 'autochomp' is disabled
        undef $a[10];
        print &quot;How unusual!\n&quot; if $a[10];
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Because when <span class="Li">&quot;autochomp&quot;</span> is
        disabled, <span class="Li">$a[10]</span> will read back as
        <span class="Li">&quot;\n&quot;</span> (or whatever the record separator
        string is.)</p>
    <p class="Pp">There are other minor differences, particularly regarding
        <span class="Li">&quot;exists&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;delete&quot;</span>, but in general, the
        correspondence is extremely close.</p>
  </li>
  <li>I have supposed that since this module is concerned with file I/O, almost
      all normal use of it will be heavily I/O bound. This means that the time
      to maintain complicated data structures inside the module will be
      dominated by the time to actually perform the I/O. When there was an
      opportunity to spend CPU time to avoid doing I/O, I usually tried to take
      it.</li>
  <li>You might be tempted to think that deferred writing is like transactions,
      with <span class="Li">&quot;flush&quot;</span> as
      <span class="Li">&quot;commit&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;discard&quot;</span> as
      <span class="Li">&quot;rollback&quot;</span>, but it isn't, so don't.</li>
  <li>There is a large memory overhead for each record offset and for each cache
      entry: about 310 bytes per cached data record, and about 21 bytes per
      offset table entry.
    <p class="Pp">The per-record overhead will limit the maximum number of
        records you can access per file. Note that <i>accessing</i> the length
        of the array via <span class="Li">&quot;$x = scalar
        @tied_file&quot;</span> accesses <b>all</b> records and stores their
        offsets. The same for <span class="Li">&quot;foreach
        (@tied_file)&quot;</span>, even if you exit the loop early.</p>

Gigantic thanks to Jarkko Hietaniemi, for agreeing to put this in the core when
  I hadn't written it yet, and for generally being helpful, supportive, and
  competent. (Usually the rule is &quot;choose any one.&quot;) Also big thanks
  to Abhijit Menon-Sen for all of the same things.
<p class="Pp">Special thanks to Craig Berry and Peter Prymmer (for VMS
    portability help), Randy Kobes (for Win32 portability help), Clinton Pierce
    and Autrijus Tang (for heroic eleventh-hour Win32 testing above and beyond
    the call of duty), Michael G Schwern (for testing advice), and the rest of
    the CPAN testers (for testing generally).</p>
<p class="Pp">Special thanks to Tels for suggesting several speed and memory
    optimizations.</p>

More tests. (Stuff I didn't think of yet.)
<p class="Pp">Paragraph mode?</p>
<p class="Pp">Fixed-length mode. Leave-blanks mode.</p>
<p class="Pp">Maybe an autolocking mode?</p>
<p class="Pp">For many common uses of the module, the read cache is a liability.
    For example, a program that inserts a single record, or that scans the file
    once, will have a cache hit rate of zero. This suggests a major
    optimization: The cache should be initially disabled. Here's a hybrid
    approach: Initially, the cache is disabled, but the cache code maintains
    statistics about how high the hit rate would be *if* it were enabled. When
    it sees the hit rate get high enough, it enables itself. The STAT comments
    in this code are the beginning of an implementation of this.</p>
<p class="Pp">Record locking with <b>fcntl()</b>? Then the module might support
    an undo log and get real transactions. What a tour de force that would
  be.</p>
<p class="Pp">Keeping track of the highest cached record. This would allow
    reads-in-a-row to skip the cache lookup faster (if reading from 1..N with
    empty cache at start, the last cached value will be always N-1).</p>
<p class="Pp">More tests.</p>
