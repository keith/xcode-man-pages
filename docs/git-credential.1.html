<p class="Pp">Git has an internal interface for storing and retrieving
    credentials from system-specific helpers, as well as prompting the user for
    usernames and passwords. The git-credential command exposes this interface
    to scripts which may want to retrieve, store, or prompt for credentials in
    the same manner as Git. The design of this scriptable interface models the
    internal C API; see credential.h for more background on the concepts.</p>
<p class="Pp">git-credential takes an &quot;action&quot; option on the
    command-line (one of <b>fill</b>, <b>approve</b>, or <b>reject</b>) and
    reads a credential description on stdin (see INPUT/OUTPUT FORMAT).</p>
<p class="Pp">If the action is <b>fill</b>, git-credential will attempt to add
    &quot;username&quot; and &quot;password&quot; attributes to the description
    by reading config files, by contacting any configured credential helpers, or
    by prompting the user. The username and password attributes of the
    credential description are then printed to stdout together with the
    attributes already provided.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the action is <b>approve</b>, git-credential will send the
    description to any configured credential helpers, which may store the
    credential for later use.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the action is <b>reject</b>, git-credential will send the
    description to any configured credential helpers, which may erase any stored
    credentials matching the description.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the action is <b>capability</b>, git-credential will announce
    any capabilities it supports to standard output.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the action is <b>approve</b> or <b>reject</b>, no output should
    be emitted.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="TYPICAL_USE_OF_GIT_CREDENTIAL"><a class="permalink" href="#TYPICAL_USE_OF_GIT_CREDENTIAL">TYPICAL
  USE OF GIT CREDENTIAL</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">An application using git-credential will typically use <b>git</b>
    <b>credential</b> following these steps:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 1.Generate a credential description based on the
  context.
<p class="Pp">For example, if we want a password for
    <b>https://example.com/foo.git</b>, we might generate the following
    credential description (don&#x2019;t forget the blank line at the end; it
    tells <b>git</b> <b>credential</b> that the application finished feeding all
    the information it has):</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>protocol=https
host=example.com
path=foo.git</pre>
</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 2.Ask git-credential to give us a username and password
  for this description. This is done by running <b>git</b> <b>credential</b>
  <b>fill</b>, feeding the description from step (1) to its standard input. The
  complete credential description (including the credential per se, i.e. the
  login and password) will be produced on standard output, like:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>protocol=https
host=example.com
username=bob
password=secr3t</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">In most cases, this means the attributes given in the input will
    be repeated in the output, but Git may also modify the credential
    description, for example by removing the <b>path</b> attribute when the
    protocol is HTTP(s) and <b>credential.useHttpPath</b> is false.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the <b>git</b> <b>credential</b> knew about the password, this
    step may not have involved the user actually typing this password (the user
    may have typed a password to unlock the keychain instead, or no user
    interaction was done if the keychain was already unlocked) before it
    returned <b>password=secr3t</b>.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 3.Use the credential (e.g., access the URL with the
  username and password from step (2)), and see if it&#x2019;s accepted.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 4.Report on the success or failure of the password. If
  the credential allowed the operation to complete successfully, then it can be
  marked with an &quot;approve&quot; action to tell <b>git</b> <b>credential</b>
  to reuse it in its next invocation. If the credential was rejected during the
  operation, use the &quot;reject&quot; action so that <b>git</b>
  <b>credential</b> will ask for a new password in its next invocation. In
  either case, <b>git</b> <b>credential</b> should be fed with the credential
  description obtained from step (2) (which also contains the fields provided in
  step (1)).</div>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="INPUT/OUTPUT_FORMAT"><a class="permalink" href="#INPUT/OUTPUT_FORMAT">INPUT/OUTPUT
  FORMAT</a></h1>
<p class="Pp"><b>git</b> <b>credential</b> reads and/or writes (depending on the
    action used) credential information in its standard input/output. This
    information can correspond either to keys for which <b>git</b>
    <b>credential</b> will obtain the login information (e.g. host, protocol,
    path), or to the actual credential data to be obtained
  (username/password).</p>
<p class="Pp">The credential is split into a set of named attributes, with one
    attribute per line. Each attribute is specified by a key-value pair,
    separated by an <b>=</b> (equals) sign, followed by a newline.</p>
<p class="Pp">The key may contain any bytes except <b>=</b>, newline, or NUL.
    The value may contain any bytes except newline or NUL. A line, including the
    trailing newline, may not exceed 65535 bytes in order to allow
    implementations to parse efficiently.</p>
<p class="Pp">Attributes with keys that end with C-style array brackets [] can
    have multiple values. Each instance of a multi-valued attribute forms an
    ordered list of values - the order of the repeated attributes defines the
    order of the values. An empty multi-valued attribute
    (<b>key</b>[]<b>=\n</b>) acts to clear any previous entries and reset the
    list.</p>
<p class="Pp">In all cases, all bytes are treated as-is (i.e., there is no
    quoting, and one cannot transmit a value with newline or NUL in it). The
    list of attributes is terminated by a blank line or end-of-file.</p>
<p class="Pp">Git understands the following attributes:</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>protocol</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The protocol over which the credential will be used
  (e.g., <b>https</b>).</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>host</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The remote hostname for a network credential. This
  includes the port number if one was specified (e.g.,
  &quot;example.com:8088&quot;).</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>path</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The path with which the credential will be used. E.g.,
  for accessing a remote https repository, this will be the repository&#x2019;s
  path on the server.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>username</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The credential&#x2019;s username, if we already have one
  (e.g., from a URL, the configuration, the user, or from a previously run
  helper).</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>password</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The credential&#x2019;s password, if we are asking it to
  be stored.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>password_expiry_utc</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Generated passwords such as an OAuth access token may
  have an expiry date. When reading credentials from helpers, <b>git</b>
  <b>credential</b> <b>fill</b> ignores expired passwords. Represented as Unix
  time UTC, seconds since 1970.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>oauth_refresh_token</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">An OAuth refresh token may accompany a password that is
  an OAuth access token. Helpers must treat this attribute as confidential like
  the password attribute. Git itself has no special behaviour for this
  attribute.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>url</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When this special attribute is read by <b>git</b>
  <b>credential</b>, the value is parsed as a URL and treated as if its
  constituent parts were read (e.g., <b>url=https://example.com</b> would behave
  as if <b>protocol=https</b> and <b>host=example.com</b> had been provided).
  This can help callers avoid parsing URLs themselves.
<p class="Pp">Note that specifying a protocol is mandatory and if the URL
    doesn&#x2019;t specify a hostname (e.g., &quot;cert:///path/to/file&quot;)
    the credential will contain a hostname attribute whose value is an empty
    string.</p>
<p class="Pp">Components which are missing from the URL (e.g., there is no
    username in the example above) will be left unset.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>authtype</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This indicates that the authentication scheme in question
  should be used. Common values for HTTP and HTTPS include <b>basic</b>,
  <b>bearer</b>, and <b>digest</b>, although the latter is insecure and should
  not be used. If <b>credential</b> is used, this may be set to an arbitrary
  string suitable for the protocol in question (usually HTTP).
<p class="Pp">This value should not be sent unless the appropriate capability
    (see below) is provided on input.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>credential</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The pre-encoded credential, suitable for the protocol in
  question (usually HTTP). If this key is sent, <b>authtype</b> is mandatory,
  and <b>username</b> and <b>password</b> are not used. For HTTP, Git
  concatenates the <b>authtype</b> value and this value with a single space to
  determine the <b>Authorization</b> header.
<p class="Pp">This value should not be sent unless the appropriate capability
    (see below) is provided on input.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>ephemeral</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This boolean value indicates, if true, that the value in
  the <b>credential</b> field should not be saved by the credential helper
  because its usefulness is limited in time. For example, an HTTP Digest
  <b>credential</b> value is computed using a nonce and reusing it will not
  result in successful authentication. This may also be used for situations with
  short duration (e.g., 24-hour) credentials. The default value is false.
<p class="Pp">The credential helper will still be invoked with <b>store</b> or
    <b>erase</b> so that it can determine whether the operation was
  successful.</p>
<p class="Pp">This value should not be sent unless the appropriate capability
    (see below) is provided on input.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>state</b>[]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This value provides an opaque state that will be passed
  back to this helper if it is called again. Each different credential helper
  may specify this once. The value should include a prefix unique to the
  credential helper and should ignore values that don&#x2019;t match its prefix.
<p class="Pp">This value should not be sent unless the appropriate capability
    (see below) is provided on input.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>continue</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This is a boolean value, which, if enabled, indicates
  that this authentication is a non-final part of a multistage authentication
  step. This is common in protocols such as NTLM and Kerberos, where two rounds
  of client authentication are required, and setting this flag allows the
  credential helper to implement the multistage authentication step. This flag
  should only be sent if a further stage is required; that is, if another round
  of authentication is expected.
<p class="Pp">This value should not be sent unless the appropriate capability
    (see below) is provided on input. This attribute is <i>one-way</i> from a
    credential helper to pass information to Git (or other programs invoking
    <b>git</b> <b>credential</b>).</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>wwwauth</b>[]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When an HTTP response is received by Git that includes
  one or more <i>WWW-Authenticate</i> authentication headers, these will be
  passed by Git to credential helpers.
<p class="Pp">Each <i>WWW-Authenticate</i> header value is passed as a
    multi-valued attribute <i>wwwauth[]</i>, where the order of the attributes
    is the same as they appear in the HTTP response. This attribute is
    <i>one-way</i> from Git to pass additional information to credential
    helpers.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>capability</b>[]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This signals that Git, or the helper, as appropriate,
  supports the capability in question. This can be used to provide better, more
  specific data as part of the protocol. A <b>capability</b>[] directive must
  precede any value depending on it and these directives <i>should</i> be the
  first item announced in the protocol.
<p class="Pp">There are two currently supported capabilities. The first is
    <b>authtype</b>, which indicates that the <b>authtype</b>,
    <b>credential</b>, and <b>ephemeral</b> values are understood. The second is
    <b>state</b>, which indicates that the <b>state</b>[] and <b>continue</b>
    values are understood.</p>
<p class="Pp">It is not obligatory to use the additional features just because
    the capability is supported, but they should not be provided without the
    capability.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Unrecognised attributes and capabilities are silently
  discarded.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="CAPABILITY_INPUT/OUTPUT_FORMAT"><a class="permalink" href="#CAPABILITY_INPUT/OUTPUT_FORMAT">CAPABILITY
  INPUT/OUTPUT FORMAT</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">For <b>git</b> <b>credential</b> <b>capability</b>, the format is
    slightly different. First, a <b>version</b> <b>0</b> announcement is made to
    indicate the current version of the protocol, and then each capability is
    announced with a line like <b>capability</b> <b>authtype</b>. Credential
    helpers may also implement this format, again with the <b>capability</b>
    argument. Additional lines may be added in the future; callers should ignore
    lines which they don&#x2019;t understand.</p>
<p class="Pp">Because this is a new part of the credential helper protocol,
    older versions of Git, as well as some credential helpers, may not support
    it. If a non-zero exit status is received, or if the first line
    doesn&#x2019;t start with the word <b>version</b> and a space, callers
    should assume that no capabilities are supported.</p>
<p class="Pp">The intention of this format is to differentiate it from the
    credential output in an unambiguous way. It is possible to use very simple
    credential helpers (e.g., inline shell scripts) which always produce
    identical output. Using a distinct format allows users to continue to use
    this syntax without having to worry about correctly implementing capability
    advertisements or accidentally confusing callers querying for
  capabilities.</p>
