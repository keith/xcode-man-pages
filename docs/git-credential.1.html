<p class="Pp">Git has an internal interface for storing and retrieving
    credentials from system-specific helpers, as well as prompting the user for
    usernames and passwords. The git-credential command exposes this interface
    to scripts which may want to retrieve, store, or prompt for credentials in
    the same manner as Git. The design of this scriptable interface models the
    internal C API; see credential.h for more background on the concepts.</p>
<p class="Pp">git-credential takes an &quot;action&quot; option on the
    command-line (one of <b>fill</b>, <b>approve</b>, or <b>reject</b>) and
    reads a credential description on stdin (see INPUT/OUTPUT FORMAT).</p>
<p class="Pp">If the action is <b>fill</b>, git-credential will attempt to add
    &quot;username&quot; and &quot;password&quot; attributes to the description
    by reading config files, by contacting any configured credential helpers, or
    by prompting the user. The username and password attributes of the
    credential description are then printed to stdout together with the
    attributes already provided.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the action is <b>approve</b>, git-credential will send the
    description to any configured credential helpers, which may store the
    credential for later use.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the action is <b>reject</b>, git-credential will send the
    description to any configured credential helpers, which may erase any stored
    credential matching the description.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the action is <b>approve</b> or <b>reject</b>, no output should
    be emitted.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="TYPICAL_USE_OF_GIT_CREDENTIAL"><a class="permalink" href="#TYPICAL_USE_OF_GIT_CREDENTIAL">TYPICAL
  USE OF GIT CREDENTIAL</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">An application using git-credential will typically use <b>git
    credential</b> following these steps:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 1.Generate a credential description based on the
  context.
<p class="Pp">For example, if we want a password for
    <b>https://example.com/foo.git</b>, we might generate the following
    credential description (don&#x2019;t forget the blank line at the end; it
    tells <b>git credential</b> that the application finished feeding all the
    information it has):</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>protocol=https
host=example.com
path=foo.git</pre>
</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 2.Ask git-credential to give us a username and password
  for this description. This is done by running <b>git credential fill</b>,
  feeding the description from step (1) to its standard input. The complete
  credential description (including the credential per se, i.e. the login and
  password) will be produced on standard output, like:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>protocol=https
host=example.com
username=bob
password=secr3t</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">In most cases, this means the attributes given in the input will
    be repeated in the output, but Git may also modify the credential
    description, for example by removing the <b>path</b> attribute when the
    protocol is HTTP(s) and <b>credential.useHttpPath</b> is false.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the <b>git credential</b> knew about the password, this step
    may not have involved the user actually typing this password (the user may
    have typed a password to unlock the keychain instead, or no user interaction
    was done if the keychain was already unlocked) before it returned
    <b>password=secr3t</b>.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 3.Use the credential (e.g., access the URL with the
  username and password from step (2)), and see if it&#x2019;s accepted.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 4.Report on the success or failure of the password. If
  the credential allowed the operation to complete successfully, then it can be
  marked with an &quot;approve&quot; action to tell <b>git credential</b> to
  reuse it in its next invocation. If the credential was rejected during the
  operation, use the &quot;reject&quot; action so that <b>git credential</b>
  will ask for a new password in its next invocation. In either case, <b>git
  credential</b> should be fed with the credential description obtained from
  step (2) (which also contain the ones provided in step (1)).</div>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="INPUT/OUTPUT_FORMAT"><a class="permalink" href="#INPUT/OUTPUT_FORMAT">INPUT/OUTPUT
  FORMAT</a></h1>
<p class="Pp"><b>git credential</b> reads and/or writes (depending on the action
    used) credential information in its standard input/output. This information
    can correspond either to keys for which <b>git credential</b> will obtain
    the login information (e.g. host, protocol, path), or to the actual
    credential data to be obtained (username/password).</p>
<p class="Pp">The credential is split into a set of named attributes, with one
    attribute per line. Each attribute is specified by a key-value pair,
    separated by an <b>=</b> (equals) sign, followed by a newline.</p>
<p class="Pp">The key may contain any bytes except <b>=</b>, newline, or NUL.
    The value may contain any bytes except newline or NUL.</p>
<p class="Pp">In both cases, all bytes are treated as-is (i.e., there is no
    quoting, and one cannot transmit a value with newline or NUL in it). The
    list of attributes is terminated by a blank line or end-of-file.</p>
<p class="Pp">Git understands the following attributes:</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>protocol</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The protocol over which the credential will be used
  (e.g., <b>https</b>).</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>host</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The remote hostname for a network credential. This
  includes the port number if one was specified (e.g.,
  &quot;example.com:8088&quot;).</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>path</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The path with which the credential will be used. E.g.,
  for accessing a remote https repository, this will be the repository&#x2019;s
  path on the server.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>username</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The credential&#x2019;s username, if we already have one
  (e.g., from a URL, the configuration, the user, or from a previously run
  helper).</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>password</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The credential&#x2019;s password, if we are asking it to
  be stored.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>url</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When this special attribute is read by <b>git
  credential</b>, the value is parsed as a URL and treated as if its constituent
  parts were read (e.g., <b>url=https://example.com</b> would behave as if
  <b>protocol=https</b> and <b>host=example.com</b> had been provided). This can
  help callers avoid parsing URLs themselves.
<p class="Pp">Note that specifying a protocol is mandatory and if the URL
    doesn&#x2019;t specify a hostname (e.g., &quot;cert:///path/to/file&quot;)
    the credential will contain a hostname attribute whose value is an empty
    string.</p>
<p class="Pp">Components which are missing from the URL (e.g., there is no
    username in the example above) will be left unset.</p>
