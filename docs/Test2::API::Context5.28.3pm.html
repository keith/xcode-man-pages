Test2::API::Context - Object to represent a testing context.
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
The context object is the primary interface for authors of testing tools written
  with Test2. The context object represents the context in which a test takes
  place (File and Line Number), and provides a quick way to generate events from
  that context. The context object also takes care of sending events to the
  correct Test2::Hub instance.
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="permalink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
In general you will not be creating contexts directly. To obtain a context you
  should always use <span class="Li">&quot;context()&quot;</span> which is
  exported by the Test2::API module.
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    use Test2::API qw/context/;

    sub my_ok {
        my ($bool, $name) = @_;
        my $ctx = context();
        $ctx-&gt;ok($bool, $name);
        $ctx-&gt;release; # You MUST do this!
        return $bool;
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Context objects make it easy to wrap other tools that also use
    context. Once you grab a context, any tool you call before releasing your
    context will inherit it:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    sub wrapper {
        my ($bool, $name) = @_;
        my $ctx = context();
        $ctx-&gt;diag(&quot;wrapping my_ok&quot;);

        my $out = my_ok($bool, $name);
        $ctx-&gt;release; # You MUST do this!
        return $out;
    }

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>you MUST always use the <b>context()</b> sub from Test2::API</dt>
  <dd>Creating your own context via
      <span class="Li">&quot;Test2::API::Context-&gt;new()&quot;</span> will
      almost never produce a desirable result. Use
      <span class="Li">&quot;context()&quot;</span> which is exported by
      Test2::API.
    <p class="Pp">There are a handful of cases where a tool author may want to
        create a new context by hand, which is why the
        <span class="Li">&quot;new&quot;</span> method exists. Unless you really
        know what you are doing you should avoid this.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>You MUST always release the context when done with it</dt>
  <dd>Releasing the context tells the system you are done with it. This gives it
      a chance to run any necessary callbacks or cleanup tasks. If you forget to
      release the context it will try to detect the problem and warn you about
      it.</dd>
  <dt>You MUST NOT pass context objects around</dt>
  <dd>When you obtain a context object it is made specifically for your tool and
      any tools nested within. If you pass a context around you run the risk of
      polluting other tools with incorrect context information.
    <p class="Pp">If you are certain that you want a different tool to use the
        same context you may pass it a snapshot.
        <span class="Li">&quot;$ctx-&gt;snapshot&quot;</span> will give you a
        shallow clone of the context that is safe to pass around or store.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>You MUST NOT store or cache a context for later</dt>
  <dd>As long as a context exists for a given hub, all tools that try to get a
      context will get the existing instance. If you try to store the context
      you will pollute other tools with incorrect context information.
    <p class="Pp">If you are certain that you want to save the context for
        later, you can use a snapshot.
        <span class="Li">&quot;$ctx-&gt;snapshot&quot;</span> will give you a
        shallow clone of the context that is safe to pass around or store.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;context()&quot;</span> has some
        mechanisms to protect you if you do cause a context to persist beyond
        the scope in which it was obtained. In practice you should not rely on
        these protections, and they are fairly noisy with warnings.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>You SHOULD obtain your context as soon as possible in a given tool</dt>
  <dd>You never know what tools you call from within your own tool will need a
      context. Obtaining the context early ensures that nested tools can find
      the context you want them to find.</dd>

<p class="Pp"><i>PER HUB</i></p>
<p class="Pp">This is how you add a release callback for all contexts created
    for a given hub. These callbacks will not run for other hubs.</p>

<pre>
    $hub-&gt;add_context_release(sub {

<p class="Pp"><i>PER CONTEXT</i></p>
<p class="Pp">This is how you add release callbacks directly to a context. The
    callback will <b>ALWAYS</b> be added to the context that gets returned, it
    does not matter if a new one is generated, or if an existing one is
    returned.</p>
