The CPAN module automates or at least simplifies the make and install of perl
  modules and extensions. It includes some primitive searching capabilities and
  knows how to use LWP, HTTP::Tiny, Net::FTP and certain external download
  clients to fetch distributions from the net.
<p class="Pp">These are fetched from one or more mirrored CPAN (Comprehensive
    Perl Archive Network) sites and unpacked in a dedicated directory.</p>
<p class="Pp">The CPAN module also supports named and versioned <i>bundles</i>
    of modules. Bundles simplify handling of sets of related modules. See
    Bundles below.</p>
<p class="Pp">The package contains a session manager and a cache manager. The
    session manager keeps track of what has been fetched, built, and installed
    in the current session. The cache manager keeps track of the disk space
    occupied by the make processes and deletes excess space using a simple FIFO
    mechanism.</p>
<p class="Pp">All methods provided are accessible in a programmer style and in
    an interactive shell style.</p>

<p class="Pp">or</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>

<p class="Pp">which puts you into a readline interface. If
    <span class="Li">&quot;Term::ReadKey&quot;</span> and either of
    <span class="Li">&quot;Term::ReadLine::Perl&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;Term::ReadLine::Gnu&quot;</span> are installed,
    history and command completion are supported.</p>
<p class="Pp">Once at the command line, type
    <span class="Li">&quot;h&quot;</span> for one-page help screen; the rest
    should be self-explanatory.</p>
<p class="Pp">The function call <span class="Li">&quot;shell&quot;</span> takes
    two optional arguments: one the prompt, the second the default initial
    command line (the latter only works if a real ReadLine interface module is
    installed).</p>
<p class="Pp">The most common uses of the interactive modes are</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>Searching for authors, bundles, distribution files and modules</dt>
  <dd>There are corresponding one-letter commands
      <span class="Li">&quot;a&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;b&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;d&quot;</span>, and
      <span class="Li">&quot;m&quot;</span> for each of the four categories and
      another, <span class="Li">&quot;i&quot;</span> for any of the mentioned
      four. Each of the four entities is implemented as a class with slightly
      differing methods for displaying an object.
    <p class="Pp">Arguments to these commands are either strings exactly
        matching the identification string of an object, or regular expressions
        matched case-insensitively against various attributes of the objects.
        The parser only recognizes a regular expression when you enclose it with
        slashes.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The principle is that the number of objects found influences
        how an item is displayed. If the search finds one item, the result is
        displayed with the rather verbose method
        <span class="Li">&quot;as_string&quot;</span>, but if more than one is
        found, each object is displayed with the terse method
        <span class="Li">&quot;as_glimpse&quot;</span>.</p>

    <p class="Pp">The examples illustrate several aspects: the first three
        queries target modules, authors, or distros directly and yield exactly
        one result. The last two use regular expressions and yield several
        results. The last one targets all of bundles, modules, authors, and
        distros simultaneously. When more than one result is available, they are
        printed in one-line format.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>&quot;get&quot;, &quot;make&quot;, &quot;test&quot;, &quot;install&quot;,
    &quot;clean&quot; modules or distributions</dt>
  <dd>These commands take any number of arguments and investigate what is
      necessary to perform the action. Argument processing is as follows:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
  known module name in format Foo/Bar.pm   module
  other embedded slash                     distribution
    - with trailing slash dot              directory
  enclosing slashes                        regexp
  known module name in format Foo::Bar     module
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If the argument is a distribution file name (recognized by
        embedded slashes), it is processed. If it is a module, CPAN determines
        the distribution file in which this module is included and processes
        that, following any dependencies named in the module's META.yml or
        Makefile.PL (this behavior is controlled by the configuration parameter
        <span class="Li">&quot;prerequisites_policy&quot;</span>). If an
        argument is enclosed in slashes it is treated as a regular expression:
        it is expanded and if the result is a single object (distribution,
        bundle or module), this object is processed.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Example:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    install Dummy::Perl                   # installs the module
    install AUXXX/Dummy-Perl-3.14.tar.gz  # installs that distribution
    install /Dummy-Perl-3.14/             # same if the regexp is unambiguous
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;get&quot;</span> downloads a
        distribution file and untars or unzips it,
        <span class="Li">&quot;make&quot;</span> builds it,
        <span class="Li">&quot;test&quot;</span> runs the test suite, and
        <span class="Li">&quot;install&quot;</span> installs it.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Any <span class="Li">&quot;make&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;test&quot;</span> is run unconditionally. An</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
  install &lt;distribution_file&gt;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">is also run unconditionally. But for</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
  install &lt;module&gt;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">CPAN checks whether an install is needed and prints <i>module
        up to date</i> if the distribution file containing the module doesn't
        need updating.</p>
    <p class="Pp">CPAN also keeps track of what it has done within the current
        session and doesn't try to build a package a second time regardless of
        whether it succeeded or not. It does not repeat a test run if the test
        has been run successfully before. Same for install runs.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;force&quot;</span> pragma may
        precede another command (currently:
        <span class="Li">&quot;get&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;make&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;test&quot;</span>, or
        <span class="Li">&quot;install&quot;</span>) to execute the command from
        scratch and attempt to continue past certain errors. See the section
        below on the <span class="Li">&quot;force&quot;</span> and the
        <span class="Li">&quot;fforce&quot;</span> pragma.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;notest&quot;</span> pragma skips
        the test part in the build process.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Example:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    cpan&gt; notest install Tk
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">A <span class="Li">&quot;clean&quot;</span> command results in
        a</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
  make clean
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">being executed within the distribution file's working
        directory.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>&quot;readme&quot;, &quot;perldoc&quot;, &quot;look&quot; module or
    distribution</dt>
  <dd><span class="Li">&quot;readme&quot;</span> displays the README file of the
      associated distribution. <span class="Li">&quot;Look&quot;</span> gets and
      untars (if not yet done) the distribution file, changes to the appropriate
      directory and opens a subshell process in that directory.
      <span class="Li">&quot;perldoc&quot;</span> displays the module's pod
      documentation in html or plain text format.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;ls&quot; author</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>&quot;ls&quot; globbing_expression</dt>
  <dd>The first form lists all distribution files in and below an author's CPAN
      directory as stored in the CHECKSUMS files distributed on CPAN. The
      listing recurses into subdirectories.
    <p class="Pp">The second form limits or expands the output with shell
        globbing as in the following examples:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
      ls JV/make*
      ls GSAR/*make*
      ls */*make*
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The last example is very slow and outputs extra progress
        indicators that break the alignment of the result.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that globbing only lists directories explicitly asked
        for, for example FOO/* will not list FOO/bar/Acme-Sthg-n.nn.tar.gz. This
        may be regarded as a bug that may be changed in some future version.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>&quot;failed&quot;</dt>
  <dd>The <span class="Li">&quot;failed&quot;</span> command reports all
      distributions that failed on one of
      <span class="Li">&quot;make&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;test&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;install&quot;</span> for some reason in the
      currently running shell session.</dd>
  <dt>Persistence between sessions</dt>
  <dd>If the <span class="Li">&quot;YAML&quot;</span> or the
      <span class="Li">&quot;YAML::Syck&quot;</span> module is installed a
      record of the internal state of all modules is written to disk after each
      step. The files contain a signature of the currently running perl version
      for later perusal.
    <p class="Pp">If the configurations variable
        <span class="Li">&quot;build_dir_reuse&quot;</span> is set to a true
        value, then CPAN.pm reads the collected YAML files. If the stored
        signature matches the currently running perl, the stored state is loaded
        into memory such that persistence between sessions is effectively
        established.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>The &quot;force&quot; and the &quot;fforce&quot; pragma</dt>
  <dd>To speed things up in complex installation scenarios, CPAN.pm keeps track
      of what it has already done and refuses to do some things a second time. A
      <span class="Li">&quot;get&quot;</span>, a
      <span class="Li">&quot;make&quot;</span>, and an
      <span class="Li">&quot;install&quot;</span> are not repeated. A
      <span class="Li">&quot;test&quot;</span> is repeated only if the previous
      test was unsuccessful. The diagnostic message when CPAN.pm refuses to do
      something a second time is one of <i>Has already been
      </i><span class="Li">&quot;unwrapped|made|tested successfully&quot;</span>
      or something similar. Another situation where CPAN refuses to act is an
      <span class="Li">&quot;install&quot;</span> if the corresponding
      <span class="Li">&quot;test&quot;</span> was not successful.
    <p class="Pp">In all these cases, the user can override this stubborn
        behaviour by prepending the command with the word force, for
      example:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
  cpan&gt; force get Foo
  cpan&gt; force make AUTHOR/Bar-3.14.tar.gz
  cpan&gt; force test Baz
  cpan&gt; force install Acme::Meta
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Each <i>forced</i> command is executed with the corresponding
        part of its memory erased.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;fforce&quot;</span> pragma is a
        variant that emulates a <span class="Li">&quot;force get&quot;</span>
        which erases the entire memory followed by the action specified,
        effectively restarting the whole get/make/test/install procedure from
        scratch.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Lockfile</dt>
  <dd>Interactive sessions maintain a lockfile, by default
      <span class="Li">&quot;~/.cpan/.lock&quot;</span>. Batch jobs can run
      without a lockfile and not disturb each other.
    <p class="Pp">The shell offers to run in <i>downgraded mode</i> when another
        process is holding the lockfile. This is an experimental feature that is
        not yet tested very well. This second shell then does not write the
        history file, does not use the metadata file, and has a different
        prompt.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Signals</dt>
  <dd>CPAN.pm installs signal handlers for SIGINT and SIGTERM. While you are in
      the cpan-shell, it is intended that you can press
      <span class="Li">&quot;^C&quot;</span> anytime and return to the
      cpan-shell prompt. A SIGTERM will cause the cpan-shell to clean up and
      leave the shell loop. You can emulate the effect of a SIGTERM by sending
      two consecutive SIGINTs, which usually means by pressing
      <span class="Li">&quot;^C&quot;</span> twice.
    <p class="Pp">CPAN.pm ignores SIGPIPE. If the user sets
        <span class="Li">&quot;inactivity_timeout&quot;</span>, a SIGALRM is
        used during the run of the <span class="Li">&quot;perl
        Makefile.PL&quot;</span> or <span class="Li">&quot;perl</span>
        <span class="Li">Build.PL&quot;</span> subprocess. A SIGALRM is also
        used during module version parsing, and is controlled by
        <span class="Li">&quot;version_timeout&quot;</span>.</p>

The commands available in the shell interface are methods in the package
  CPAN::Shell. If you enter the shell command, your input is split by the
  <b>Text::ParseWords::shellwords()</b> routine, which acts like most shells do.
  The first word is interpreted as the method to be invoked, and the rest of the
  words are treated as the method's arguments. Continuation lines are supported
  by ending a line with a literal backslash.

  Duplicates of each distribution are suppressed. The name of the bundle file is

<h2 class="Ss" id="recompile"><a class="permalink" href="#recompile">recompile</a></h2>
<b>recompile()</b> is a special command that takes no argument and runs the
  make/test/install cycle with brute force over all installed dynamically
  loadable extensions (a.k.a. XS modules) with 'force' in effect. The primary
  purpose of this command is to finish a network installation. Imagine you have
  a common source tree for two different architectures. You decide to do a
  completely independent fresh installation. You start on one architecture with
  the help of a Bundle file produced earlier. CPAN installs the whole Bundle for
  you, but when you try to repeat the job on the second architecture, CPAN
  responds with a <span class="Li">&quot;Foo up to date&quot;</span> message for
  all modules. So you invoke CPAN's recompile on the second architecture and
  you're done.
<p class="Pp">Another popular use for
    <span class="Li">&quot;recompile&quot;</span> is to act as a rescue in case
    your perl breaks binary compatibility. If one of the modules that CPAN uses
    is in turn depending on binary compatibility (so you cannot run CPAN
    commands), then you should try the CPAN::Nox module for recovery.</p>

  four &quot;CPAN::*&quot; Classes: Author, Bundle, Module,
  Distribution</a></h2>
Although it may be considered internal, the class hierarchy does matter for both
  users and programmer. CPAN.pm deals with the four classes mentioned above, and
  those classes all share a set of methods. Classical single polymorphism is in
  effect. A metaclass object registers all objects of all kinds and indexes them
  with a string. The strings referencing objects have a separated namespace
  (well, not completely separated):
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
         Namespace                         Class

   words containing a &quot;/&quot; (slash)      Distribution
    words starting with Bundle::          Bundle
          everything else            Module or Author
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Modules know their associated Distribution objects. They always
    refer to the most recent official release. Developers may mark their
    releases as unstable development versions (by inserting an underscore into
    the module version number which will also be reflected in the distribution
    name when you run 'make dist'), so the really hottest and newest
    distribution is not always the default. If a module Foo circulates on CPAN
    in both version 1.23 and 1.23_90, CPAN.pm offers a convenient way to install
    version 1.23 by saying</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    install Foo
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This would install the complete distribution file (say
    BAR/Foo-1.23.tar.gz) with all accompanying material. But if you would like
    to install version 1.23_90, you need to know where the distribution file
    resides on CPAN relative to the authors/id/ directory. If the author is BAR,
    this might be BAR/Foo-1.23_90.tar.gz; so you would have to say</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    install BAR/Foo-1.23_90.tar.gz
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The first example will be driven by an object of the class
    CPAN::Module, the second by an object of class CPAN::Distribution.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Integrating_local_directories"><a class="permalink" href="#Integrating_local_directories">Integrating
  local directories</a></h2>
Note: this feature is still in alpha state and may change in future versions of
  CPAN.pm
<p class="Pp">Distribution objects are normally distributions from the CPAN, but
    there is a slightly degenerate case for Distribution objects, too, of
    projects held on the local disk. These distribution objects have the same
    name as the local directory and end with a dot. A dot by itself is also
    allowed for the current directory at the time CPAN.pm was used. All actions
    such as <span class="Li">&quot;make&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;test&quot;</span>, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;install&quot;</span> are applied directly to that
    directory. This gives the command <span class="Li">&quot;cpan .&quot;</span>
    an interesting touch: while the normal mantra of installing a CPAN module
    without CPAN.pm is one of</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    perl Makefile.PL                 perl Build.PL
           ( go and get prerequisites )
    make                             ./Build
    make test                        ./Build test
    make install                     ./Build install
</pre>
<p class="Pp">the command <span class="Li">&quot;cpan .&quot;</span> does all of
    this at once. It figures out which of the two mantras is appropriate,
    fetches and installs all prerequisites, takes care of them recursively, and
    finally finishes the installation of the module in the current directory, be
    it a CPAN module or not.</p>
<p class="Pp">The typical usage case is for private modules or working copies of
    projects from remote repositories on the local disk.</p>

The usual shell redirection symbols <span class="Li">&quot; | &quot;</span> and

<pre>
  CPAN::Plugin::Flurb=dir,/opt/pkgs/flurb/raw,verbose,1

<p class="Pp">At run time, each listed plugin is instantiated as a singleton
    object by running the equivalent of this pseudo code:</p>

  &lt;generate Modulename and arguments from $plugin&gt;;

<p class="Pp">The generated singletons are kept around from instantiation until
    the end of the shell session. &lt;plugin_list&gt; can be reconfigured at any
    time at run time. While the cpan shell is running, it checks all activated
    plugins at each of the 8 reference points listed above and runs the
    respective method if it is implemented for that object. The method is called
    with the active CPAN::Distribution object passed in as an argument.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="CONFIGURATION"><a class="permalink" href="#CONFIGURATION">CONFIGURATION</a></h1>
When the CPAN module is used for the first time, a configuration dialogue tries
  to determine a couple of site specific options. The result of the dialog is
  stored in a hash reference <span class="Li"> $CPAN::Config </span> in a file
  CPAN/Config.pm.
<p class="Pp">Default values defined in the CPAN/Config.pm file can be
    overridden in a user specific file: CPAN/MyConfig.pm. Such a file is best
    placed in <span class="Li">&quot;$HOME/.cpan/CPAN/MyConfig.pm&quot;</span>,
    because <span class="Li">&quot;$HOME/.cpan&quot;</span> is added to the
    search path of the CPAN module before the <b>use()</b> or <b>require()</b>
    statements. The mkmyconfig command writes this file for you.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;o conf&quot;</span> command has various
    bells and whistles:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>completion support</dt>
  <dd>If you have a ReadLine module installed, you can hit TAB at any point of
      the commandline and <span class="Li">&quot;o conf&quot;</span> will offer
      you completion for the built-in subcommands and/or config variable
    names.</dd>
  <dt>displaying some help: o conf help</dt>
  <dd>Displays a short help</dd>
  <dt>displaying current values: o conf [KEY]</dt>
  <dd>Displays the current value(s) for this config variable. Without KEY,
      displays all subcommands and config variables.
    <p class="Pp">Example:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
  o conf shell
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If KEY starts and ends with a slash, the string in between is
        treated as a regular expression and only keys matching this regexp are
        displayed</p>
    <p class="Pp">Example:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
  o conf /color/
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>changing of scalar values: o conf KEY VALUE</dt>
  <dd>Sets the config variable KEY to VALUE. The empty string can be specified
      as usual in shells, with <span class="Li">''</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;&quot;</span>
    <p class="Pp">Example:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>

  o conf wget /usr/bin/wget
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>changing of list values: o conf KEY
    SHIFT|UNSHIFT|PUSH|POP|SPLICE|LIST</dt>
  <dd>If a config variable name ends with
      <span class="Li">&quot;list&quot;</span>, it is a list.
      <span class="Li">&quot;o conf</span> <span class="Li">KEY
      shift&quot;</span> removes the first element of the list,
      <span class="Li">&quot;o conf KEY pop&quot;</span> removes the last
      element of the list. <span class="Li">&quot;o conf KEYS unshift
      LIST&quot;</span> prepends a list of values to the list,
      <span class="Li">&quot;o conf KEYS push LIST&quot;</span> appends a list
      of valued to the list.
    <p class="Pp">Likewise, <span class="Li">&quot;o conf KEY splice
        LIST&quot;</span> passes the LIST to the corresponding splice
      command.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Finally, any other list of arguments is taken as a new list
        value for the KEY variable discarding the previous value.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Examples:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
  o conf urllist unshift http://cpan.dev.local/CPAN
  o conf urllist splice 3 1
  o conf urllist http://cpan1.local http://cpan2.local ftp://ftp.perl.org
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>reverting to saved: o conf defaults</dt>
  <dd>Reverts all config variables to the state in the saved config file.</dd>
  <dt>saving the config: o conf commit</dt>
  <dd>Saves all config variables to the current config file (CPAN/Config.pm or
      CPAN/MyConfig.pm that was loaded at start).</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The configuration dialog can be started any time later again by
    issuing the command <span class="Li">&quot; o conf init &quot;</span> in the
    CPAN shell. A subset of the configuration dialog can be run by issuing
    <span class="Li">&quot;o conf init WORD&quot;</span> where WORD is any valid

The <span class="Li">&quot;urllist&quot;</span> parameter of the configuration
  table contains a list of URLs used for downloading. If the list contains any
  <span class="Li">&quot;file&quot;</span> URLs, CPAN always tries there first.
  This feature is disabled for index files. So the recommendation for the owner
  of a CD-ROM with CPAN contents is: include your local, possibly outdated
  CD-ROM as a <span class="Li">&quot;file&quot;</span> URL at the end of
  urllist, e.g.
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  o conf urllist push file://localhost/CDROM/CPAN
</pre>
<p class="Pp">CPAN.pm will then fetch the index files from one of the CPAN sites
    that come at the beginning of urllist. It will later check for each module
    to see whether there is a local copy of the most recent version.</p>
<p class="Pp">Another peculiarity of urllist is that the site that we could
    successfully fetch the last file from automatically gets a preference token
    and is tried as the first site for the next request. So if you add a new
    site at runtime it may happen that the previously preferred site will be
    tried another time. This means that if you want to disallow a site for the
    next transfer, it must be explicitly removed from urllist.</p>

If you have YAML.pm (or some other YAML module configured in
  <span class="Li">&quot;yaml_module&quot;</span>) installed, CPAN.pm collects a
  few statistical data about recent downloads. You can view the statistics with

  by looking into the <span class="Li">&quot;FTPstats.yml&quot;</span> file in

<p class="Pp">To get some interesting statistics, it is recommended that

  declarations</a></h2>
Since CPAN.pm version 1.88_51 modules declared as
  <span class="Li">&quot;build_requires&quot;</span> by a distribution are
  treated differently depending on the config variable
  <span class="Li">&quot;build_requires_install_policy&quot;</span>. By setting
  <span class="Li">&quot;build_requires_install_policy&quot;</span> to
  <span class="Li">&quot;no&quot;</span>, such a module is not installed. It is
  only built and tested, and then kept in the list of tested but uninstalled
  modules. As such, it is available during the build of the dependent module by
  integrating the path to the <span class="Li">&quot;blib/arch&quot;</span> and
  <span class="Li">&quot;blib/lib&quot;</span> directories in the environment
  variable PERL5LIB. If
  <span class="Li">&quot;build_requires_install_policy&quot;</span> is set ti
  <span class="Li">&quot;yes&quot;</span>, then both modules declared as
  <span class="Li">&quot;requires&quot;</span> and those declared as
  <span class="Li">&quot;build_requires&quot;</span> are treated alike. By
  setting to <span class="Li">&quot;ask/yes&quot;</span> or
  <span class="Li">&quot;ask/no&quot;</span>, CPAN.pm asks the user and sets the
  default accordingly.

  for individual distributions (<i>Distroprefs</i>)</a></h2>
(<b>Note:</b> This feature has been introduced in CPAN.pm 1.8854)
<p class="Pp">Distributions on CPAN usually behave according to what we call the
    CPAN mantra. Or since the advent of Module::Build we should talk about two
    mantras:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    perl Makefile.PL     perl Build.PL
    make                 ./Build
    make test            ./Build test
    make install         ./Build install
</pre>
<p class="Pp">But some modules cannot be built with this mantra. They try to get
    some extra data from the user via the environment, extra arguments, or
    interactively--thus disturbing the installation of large bundles like
    Phalanx100 or modules with many dependencies like Plagger.</p>
<p class="Pp">The distroprefs system of
    <span class="Li">&quot;CPAN.pm&quot;</span> addresses this problem by
    allowing the user to specify extra informations and recipes in YAML files to
    either</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>pass additional arguments to one of the four commands,</li>
  <li>set environment variables</li>
  <li>instantiate an Expect object that reads from the console, waits for some
      regular expressions and enters some answers</li>
  <li>temporarily override assorted <span class="Li">&quot;CPAN.pm&quot;</span>
      configuration variables</li>
  <li>specify dependencies the original maintainer forgot</li>
  <li>disable the installation of an object altogether</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">See the YAML and Data::Dumper files that come with the
    <span class="Li">&quot;CPAN.pm&quot;</span> distribution in the
    <span class="Li">&quot;distroprefs/&quot;</span> directory for examples.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Filenames"><a class="permalink" href="#Filenames">Filenames</a></h2>
The YAML files themselves must have the <span class="Li">&quot;.yml&quot;</span>
  extension; all other files are ignored (for two exceptions see <i>Fallback
  Data::Dumper and</i> <i>Storable</i> below). The containing directory can be
  specified in <span class="Li">&quot;CPAN.pm&quot;</span> in the
  <span class="Li">&quot;prefs_dir&quot;</span> config variable. Try
  <span class="Li">&quot;o conf init</span>
  <span class="Li">prefs_dir&quot;</span> in the CPAN shell to set and activate
  the distroprefs system.
<p class="Pp">Every YAML file may contain arbitrary documents according to the
    YAML specification, and every document is treated as an entity that can
    specify the treatment of a single distribution.</p>
<p class="Pp">Filenames can be picked arbitrarily;
    <span class="Li">&quot;CPAN.pm&quot;</span> always reads all files (in
    alphabetical order) and takes the key
    <span class="Li">&quot;match&quot;</span> (see below in <i>Language
    Specs</i>) as a hashref containing match criteria that determine if the
    current distribution matches the YAML document or not.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Fallback_Data::Dumper_and_Storable"><a class="permalink" href="#Fallback_Data::Dumper_and_Storable">Fallback
  Data::Dumper and Storable</a></h2>
If neither your configured <span class="Li">&quot;yaml_module&quot;</span> nor
  YAML.pm is installed, CPAN.pm falls back to using Data::Dumper and Storable
  and looks for files with the extensions
  <span class="Li">&quot;.dd&quot;</span> or
  <span class="Li">&quot;.st&quot;</span> in the
  <span class="Li">&quot;prefs_dir&quot;</span> directory. These files are
  expected to contain one or more hashrefs. For Data::Dumper generated files,
  this is expected to be done with by defining <span class="Li">$VAR1</span>,
  <span class="Li">$VAR2</span>, etc. The YAML shell would produce these with
  the command
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    ysh &lt; somefile.yml &gt; somefile.dd
</pre>
<p class="Pp">For Storable files the rule is that they must be constructed such
    that <span class="Li">&quot;Storable::retrieve(file)&quot;</span> returns an
    array reference and the array elements represent one distropref object each.
    The conversion from YAML would look like so:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    perl -MYAML=LoadFile -MStorable=nstore -e '
        @y=LoadFile(shift);
        nstore(\@y, shift)' somefile.yml somefile.st
</pre>
<p class="Pp">In bootstrapping situations it is usually sufficient to translate
    only a few YAML files to Data::Dumper for crucial modules like
    <span class="Li">&quot;YAML::Syck&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;YAML.pm&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;Expect.pm&quot;</span>. If you prefer Storable over
    Data::Dumper, remember to pull out a Storable version that writes an older
    format than all the other Storable versions that will need to read them.</p>

        happen with a question-answer pair after it has been used. In the
        default case (reuse=0) it is removed from the array, avoiding being used
        again accidentally. If you want to answer the question
        <span class="Li">&quot;Do you really want to do that&quot;</span>
        several times, then it must be included in the array at least as often
        as you want this answer to be given. Setting the parameter
        <span class="Li">&quot;reuse&quot;</span> to 1 makes this repetition

  INTERFACE</a></h1>
If you do not enter the shell, shell commands are available both as methods
  (<span class="Li">&quot;CPAN::Shell-&gt;install(...)&quot;</span>) and as
  functions in the calling package
  (<span class="Li">&quot;install(...)&quot;</span>). Before calling low-level
  commands, it makes sense to initialize components of CPAN you need, e.g.:
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  CPAN::HandleConfig-&gt;load;
  CPAN::Shell::setup_output;
  CPAN::Index-&gt;reload;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">High-level commands do such initializations automatically.</p>
<p class="Pp">There's currently only one class that has a stable interface -
    CPAN::Shell. All commands that are available in the CPAN shell are methods
    of the class CPAN::Shell. The arguments on the commandline are passed as
    arguments to the method.</p>
<p class="Pp">So if you take for example the shell command</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  notest install A B C
</pre>
<p class="Pp">the actually executed command is</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  CPAN::Shell-&gt;notest(&quot;install&quot;,&quot;A&quot;,&quot;B&quot;,&quot;C&quot;);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Each of the commands that produce listings of modules
    (<span class="Li">&quot;r&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;autobundle&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;u&quot;</span>) also return a list of the IDs of all
    modules within the list.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>expand($type,@things)</dt>
  <dd>The IDs of all objects available within a program are strings that can be
      expanded to the corresponding real objects with the
      <span class="Li">&quot;CPAN::Shell-&gt;expand(&quot;Module&quot;,@things)&quot;</span>
      method. Expand returns a list of CPAN::Module objects according to the
      <span class="Li">@things</span> arguments given. In scalar context, it
      returns only the first element of the list.</dd>
  <dt>expandany(@things)</dt>
  <dd>Like expand, but returns objects of the appropriate type, i.e.
      CPAN::Bundle objects for bundles, CPAN::Module objects for modules, and
      CPAN::Distribution objects for distributions. Note: it does not expand to
      CPAN::Author objects.</dd>
  <dt>Programming Examples</dt>
  <dd>This enables the programmer to do operations that combine functionalities
      that are available in the shell.

    # install everything that is outdated on my disk:

    # list all modules on my disk that have no VERSION number

    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Or if you want to schedule a <i>cron</i> job to watch CPAN,
        you could list all modules that need updating. First a quick and dirty
        way:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    perl -e 'use CPAN; CPAN::Shell-&gt;r;'
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If you don't want any output should all modules be up to date,
        parse the output of above command for the regular expression
        <span class="Li">&quot;/modules are up to date/&quot;</span> and decide
        to mail the output only if it doesn't match.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you prefer to do it more in a programmerish style in one
        single process, something like this may better suit you:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
  # list all modules on my disk that have newer versions on CPAN
  for $mod (CPAN::Shell-&gt;expand(&quot;Module&quot;,&quot;/./&quot;)) {
    next unless $mod-&gt;inst_file;
    next if $mod-&gt;uptodate;
    printf &quot;Module %s is installed as %s, could be updated to %s from CPAN\n&quot;,
        $mod-&gt;id, $mod-&gt;inst_version, $mod-&gt;cpan_version;
  }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If that gives too much output every day, you may want to watch
        only for three modules. You can write</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
  for $mod (CPAN::Shell-&gt;expand(&quot;Module&quot;,&quot;/Apache|LWP|CGI/&quot;)) {

Currently the cache manager only keeps track of the build directory
  ($CPAN::Config-&gt;{build_dir}). It is a simple FIFO mechanism that deletes
  complete directories below <span class="Li">&quot;build_dir&quot;</span> as
  soon as the size of all directories there gets bigger than
  <span class="Li">$CPAN::Config</span>-&gt;{build_cache} (in MB). The contents
  of this cache may be used for later re-installations that you intend to do
  manually, but will never be trusted by CPAN itself. This is due to the fact
  that the user might use these directories for building modules on different
  architectures.
<p class="Pp">There is another directory ($CPAN::Config-&gt;{keep_source_where})
    where the original distribution files are kept. This directory is not
    covered by the cache manager and must be controlled by the user. If you
    choose to have the same directory as build_dir and as keep_source_where
    directory, then your sources will be deleted with the same fifo
  mechanism.</p>

A bundle is just a perl module in the namespace Bundle:: that does not define
  any functions or methods. It usually only contains documentation.
<p class="Pp">It starts like a perl module with a package declaration and a
    <span class="Li">$VERSION</span> variable. After that the pod section looks
    like any other pod with the only difference being that <i>one special pod
    section</i> exists starting with (verbatim):</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    =head1 CONTENTS
</pre>
<p class="Pp">In this pod section each line obeys the format</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
        Module_Name [Version_String] [- optional text]
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The only required part is the first field, the name of a module
    (e.g. Foo::Bar, i.e. <i>not</i> the name of the distribution file). The rest
    of the line is optional. The comment part is delimited by a dash just as in
    the man page header.</p>
<p class="Pp">The distribution of a bundle should follow the same convention as
    other distributions.</p>
<p class="Pp">Bundles are treated specially in the CPAN package. If you say
    'install Bundle::Tkkit' (assuming such a bundle exists), CPAN will install
    all the modules in the CONTENTS section of the pod. You can install your own
    Bundles locally by placing a conformant Bundle file somewhere into your
    <span class="Li">@INC</span> path. The <b>autobundle()</b> command which is
    available in the shell interface does that for you by including all
    currently installed modules in a snapshot bundle file.</p>

The CPAN program is trying to depend on as little as possible so the user can

  environment provides. For example if you try in the CPAN shell
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  install Bundle::CPAN

<p class="Pp">or</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>

<p class="Pp">you will find the shell more convenient than the bare shell
    before.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you have a local mirror of CPAN and can access all files with
    &quot;file:&quot; URLs, then you only need a perl later than perl5.003 to
    run this module. Otherwise Net::FTP is strongly recommended. LWP may be
    required for non-UNIX systems, or if your nearest CPAN site is associated
    with a URL that is not <span class="Li">&quot;ftp:&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you have neither Net::FTP nor LWP, there is a fallback
    mechanism implemented for an external ftp command or for an external lynx

Debugging this module is more than a bit complex due to interference from the

CPAN.pm works nicely without network access, too. If you maintain machines that

There's no strong security layer in CPAN.pm. CPAN.pm helps you to install

<h2 class="Ss" id="Cryptographically_signed_modules"><a class="permalink" href="#Cryptographically_signed_modules">Cryptographically

Since release 1.77, CPAN.pm has been able to verify cryptographically signed
  module distributions using Module::Signature. The CPAN modules can be signed
  by their authors, thus giving more security. The simple unsigned MD5 checksums
  that were used before by CPAN protect mainly against accidental file
  corruption.
<p class="Pp">You will need to have Module::Signature installed, which in turn
    requires that you have at least one of Crypt::OpenPGP module or the
    command-line <i>gpg</i> tool installed.</p>
<p class="Pp">You will also need to be able to connect over the Internet to the
    public key servers, like pgp.mit.edu, and their port 11731 (the HKP

When the CPAN shell enters a subshell via the look command, it sets the
  environment CPAN_SHELL_LEVEL to 1, or increments that variable if it is
  already set.
<p class="Pp">When CPAN runs, it sets the environment variable
    PERL5_CPAN_IS_RUNNING to the ID of the running process. It also sets
    PERL5_CPANPLUS_IS_RUNNING to prevent runaway processes which could happen
    with older versions of Module::Install.</p>
<p class="Pp">When running <span class="Li">&quot;perl Makefile.PL&quot;</span>,
    the environment variable

<p class="Pp">When the config variable ftp_passive is set, all downloads will be
    run with the environment variable FTP_PASSIVE set to this value. This is in
    general a good idea as it influences both Net::FTP and LWP based
    connections. The same effect can be achieved by starting the cpan shell with

  AN INSTALLATION WITH LOTS OF MODULES</a></h1>
Populating a freshly installed perl with one's favorite modules is pretty easy
  if you maintain a private bundle definition file. To get a useful blueprint of
  a bundle definition file, the command autobundle can be used on the CPAN shell
  command line. This command writes a bundle definition file for all modules
  installed for the current perl interpreter. It's recommended to run this
  command once only, and from then on maintain the file manually under a private
  name, say Bundle/my_bundle.pm. With a clever bundle file you can then simply
  say
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    cpan&gt; install Bundle::my_bundle
</pre>
<p class="Pp">then answer a few questions and go out for coffee (possibly even
    in a different city).</p>
<p class="Pp">Maintaining a bundle definition file means keeping track of two
    things: dependencies and interactivity. CPAN.pm sometimes fails on
    calculating dependencies because not all modules define all MakeMaker
    attributes correctly, so a bundle definition file should specify
    prerequisites as early as possible. On the other hand, it's annoying that so
    many distributions need some interactive configuring. So what you can try to
    accomplish in your private bundle file is to have the packages that need to
    be configured early in the file and the gentle ones later, so you can go out
    for coffee after a few minutes and leave CPAN.pm to churn away
  unattended.</p>

Thanks to Graham Barr for contributing the following paragraphs about the
  interaction between perl, and various firewall configurations. For further
  information on firewalls, it is recommended to consult the documentation that
  comes with the <i>ncftp</i> program. If you are unable to go through the

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Three_basic_types_of_firewalls"><a class="permalink" href="#Three_basic_types_of_firewalls">Three
  basic types of firewalls</a></h2>
Firewalls can be categorized into three basic types.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>http firewall</dt>
  <dd>This is when the firewall machine runs a web server, and to access the
      outside world, you must do so via that web server. If you set environment
      variables like http_proxy or ftp_proxy to values beginning with http://,
      or in your web browser you've proxy information set, then you know you are
      running behind an http firewall.
    <p class="Pp">To access servers outside these types of firewalls with perl
        (even for ftp), you need LWP or HTTP::Tiny.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>ftp firewall</dt>
  <dd>This where the firewall machine runs an ftp server. This kind of firewall
      will only let you access ftp servers outside the firewall. This is usually
      done by connecting to the firewall with ftp, then entering a username like
      &quot;user@outside.host.com&quot;.
    <p class="Pp">To access servers outside these type of firewalls with perl,
        you need Net::FTP.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>One-way visibility</dt>
  <dd>One-way visibility means these firewalls try to make themselves invisible
      to users inside the firewall. An FTP data connection is normally created
      by sending your IP address to the remote server and then listening for the
      return connection. But the remote server will not be able to connect to
      you because of the firewall. For these types of firewall, FTP connections
      need to be done in a passive mode.
    <p class="Pp">There are two that I can think off.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>SOCKS</dt>
  <dd>If you are using a SOCKS firewall, you will need to compile perl and link
      it with the SOCKS library. This is what is normally called a 'socksified'
      perl. With this executable you will be able to connect to servers outside
      the firewall as if it were not there.</dd>
  <dt>IP Masquerade</dt>
  <dd>This is when the firewall implemented in the kernel (via NAT, or
      networking address translation), it allows you to hide a complete network
      behind one IP address. With this firewall no special compiling is needed
      as you can access hosts directly.
    <p class="Pp">For accessing ftp servers behind such firewalls you usually
        need to set the environment variable
        <span class="Li">&quot;FTP_PASSIVE&quot;</span> or the config variable
        ftp_passive to a true value.</p>

  <dd>I am not root, how can I install a module in a personal directory?
    <p class="Pp">As of CPAN 1.9463, if you do not have permission to write the
        default perl library directories, CPAN's configuration process will ask
        you whether you want to bootstrap &lt;local::lib&gt;, which makes
        keeping a personal perl library directory easy.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Another thing you should bear in mind is that the UNINST
        parameter can be dangerous when you are installing into a private area
        because you might accidentally remove modules that other people depend
        on that are not using the private area.</p>

  <dd>I installed a Bundle and had a couple of fails. When I retried, everything
      resolved nicely. Can this be fixed to work on first try?
    <p class="Pp">The reason for this is that CPAN does not know the
        dependencies of all modules when it starts out. To decide about the
        additional items to install, it just uses data found in the META.yml
        file or the generated Makefile. An undetected missing piece breaks the
        process. But it may well be that your Bundle installs some prerequisite
        later than some depending item and thus your second try is able to
        resolve everything. Please note, CPAN.pm does not know the dependency
        tree in advance and cannot sort the queue of things to install in a
        topologically correct order. It resolves perfectly well <b>if</b> all
        modules declare the prerequisites correctly with the PREREQ_PM attribute
        to MakeMaker or the <span class="Li">&quot;requires&quot;</span> stanza
        of Module::Build. For bundles which fail and you need to install often,
        it is recommended to sort the Bundle definition file manually.</p>

  <dd>In our intranet, we have many modules for internal use. How can I
      integrate these modules with CPAN.pm but without uploading the modules to

    <p class="Pp">Have a look at the CPAN::Site module.</p>

  <dt>9)</dt>
  <dd>When I run CPAN's shell, I get an error message about things in my
      <span class="Li">&quot;/etc/inputrc&quot;</span> (or
      <span class="Li">&quot;~/.inputrc&quot;</span>) file.
    <p class="Pp">These are readline issues and can only be fixed by studying
        readline configuration on your architecture and adjusting the referenced
        file accordingly. Please make a backup of the
        <span class="Li">&quot;/etc/inputrc&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;~/.inputrc&quot;</span> and edit them. Quite
        often harmless changes like uppercasing or lowercasing some arguments
        solves the problem.</p>

  <dd>Some authors have strange characters in their names.
    <p class="Pp">Internally CPAN.pm uses the UTF-8 charset. If your terminal is
        expecting ISO-8859-1 charset, a converter can be activated by setting
        term_is_latin to a true value in your config file. One way of doing so
        would be</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    cpan&gt; o conf term_is_latin 1
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If other charset support is needed, please file a bug report
        against CPAN.pm at rt.cpan.org and describe your needs. Maybe we can
        extend the support or maybe UTF-8 terminals become widely available.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note: this config variable is deprecated and will be removed
        in a future version of CPAN.pm. It will be replaced with the conventions
        around the family of <span class="Li">$LANG</span> and
        <span class="Li">$LC_</span>* environment variables.</p>

  <dd>How do I install a &quot;DEVELOPER RELEASE&quot; of a module?
    <p class="Pp">By default, CPAN will install the latest non-developer release
        of a module. If you want to install a dev release, you have to specify
        the partial path starting with the author id to the tarball you wish to
        install, like so:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    cpan&gt; install KWILLIAMS/Module-Build-0.27_07.tar.gz
    </pre>

  <dd>How do I install a module and all its dependencies from the commandline,
      without being prompted for anything, despite my CPAN configuration (or
      lack thereof)?
    <p class="Pp">CPAN uses ExtUtils::MakeMaker's <b>prompt()</b> function to
        ask its questions, so if you set the PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT environment
        variable, you shouldn't be asked any questions at all (assuming the
        modules you are installing are nice about obeying that variable as
        well):</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>

  <dd>I'm frequently irritated with the CPAN shell's inability to help me select
      a good mirror.
    <p class="Pp">CPAN can now help you select a &quot;good&quot; mirror, based
        on which ones have the lowest 'ping' round-trip times. From the shell,
        use the command 'o conf init urllist' and allow CPAN to automatically
        select mirrors for you.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Beyond that help, the urllist config parameter is yours. You
        can add and remove sites at will. You should find out which sites have
        the best up-to-dateness, bandwidth, reliability, etc. and are
        topologically close to you. Some people prefer fast downloads, others
        up-to-dateness, others reliability. You decide which to try in which
        order.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Henk P. Penning maintains a site that collects data about CPAN
        sites:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>

    <pre>
  o conf init randomize_urllist ftpstats_period ftpstats_size
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">and choose your favorite parameters. After a few downloads
        running the <span class="Li">&quot;hosts&quot;</span> command will
        probably assist you in choosing the best mirror sites.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>16)</dt>
  <dd>Why do I get asked the same questions every time I start the shell?
    <p class="Pp">You can make your configuration changes permanent by calling
        the command <span class="Li">&quot;o conf commit&quot;</span>.
        Alternatively set the <span class="Li">&quot;auto_commit&quot;</span>
        variable to true by running <span class="Li">&quot;o conf init
        auto_commit&quot;</span> and answering the following question with
      yes.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>17)</dt>
  <dd>Older versions of CPAN.pm had the original root directory of all tarballs
      in the build directory. Now there are always random characters appended to
      these directory names. Why was this done?
    <p class="Pp">The random characters are provided by File::Temp and ensure
        that each module's individual build directory is unique. This makes
        running CPAN.pm in concurrent processes simultaneously safe.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>18)</dt>
  <dd>Speaking of the build directory. Do I have to clean it up myself?
    <p class="Pp">You have the choice to set the config variable
        <span class="Li">&quot;scan_cache&quot;</span> to
        <span class="Li">&quot;never&quot;</span>. Then you must clean it up
        yourself. The other possible values,
        <span class="Li">&quot;atstart&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;atexit&quot;</span> clean up the build directory
        when you start (or more precisely, after the first extraction into the
        build directory) or exit the CPAN shell, respectively. If you never
        start up the CPAN shell, you probably also have to clean up the build
        directory yourself.</p>

CPAN.pm is regularly tested to run under 5.005 and assorted newer versions. It
  is getting more and more difficult to get the minimal prerequisites working on
  older perls. It is close to impossible to get the whole Bundle::CPAN working
  there. If you're in the position to have only these old versions, be advised
  that CPAN is designed to work fine without the Bundle::CPAN installed.
<p class="Pp">To get things going, note that GBARR/Scalar-List-Utils-1.18.tar.gz
    is compatible with ancient perls and that File::Temp is listed as a
    prerequisite but CPAN has reasonable workarounds if it is missing.</p>

This module and its competitor, the CPANPLUS module, are both much cooler than
  the other. CPAN.pm is older. CPANPLUS was designed to be more modular, but it

Many people enter the CPAN shell by running the cpan utility program which is
  installed in the same directory as perl itself. So if you have this directory
  in your PATH variable (or some equivalent in your operating system) then
  typing <span class="Li">&quot;cpan&quot;</span> in a console window will work
  for you as well. Above that the utility provides several commandline
  shortcuts.
