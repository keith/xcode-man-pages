   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

<p class="Pp">The <b>grid</b> command is used to communicate with the grid
    geometry manager that arranges widgets in rows and columns inside of another
    window, called the geometry master (or master window). The <b>grid</b>
    command can have any of several forms, depending on the <i>option</i>
    argument:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="grid"><a class="permalink" href="#grid"><b>grid </b><i>slave
    </i>?<i>slave ...</i>? ?<i>options</i>?</a></dt>
  <dd>If the first argument to <b>grid</b> is suitable as the first slave
      argument to <b>grid configure</b>, either a window name (any value
      starting with <b>.</b>) or one of the characters <b>x</b> or <b>^</b> (see
      the <b>RELATIVE PLACEMENT</b> section below), then the command is
      processed in the same way as <b>grid configure</b>.</dd>
  <dt id="grid~2"><a class="permalink" href="#grid~2"><b>grid anchor
    </b><i>master</i> ?<i>anchor</i>?</a></dt>
  <dd>The anchor value controls how to place the grid within the master when no
      row/column has any weight. See <b>THE GRID ALGORITHM</b> below for further
      details. The default <i>anchor</i> is <i>nw</i>.</dd>
  <dt id="grid~3"><a class="permalink" href="#grid~3"><b>grid bbox
    </b><i>master</i> ?<i>column row</i>? ?<i>column2 row2</i>?</a></dt>
  <dd>With no arguments, the bounding box (in pixels) of the grid is returned.
      The return value consists of 4 integers. The first two are the pixel
      offset from the master window (x then y) of the top-left corner of the
      grid, and the second two integers are the width and height of the grid,
      also in pixels. If a single <i>column</i> and <i>row</i> is specified on
      the command line, then the bounding box for that cell is returned, where
      the top left cell is numbered from zero. If both <i>column</i> and
      <i>row</i> arguments are specified, then the bounding box spanning the
      rows and columns indicated is returned.</dd>
  <dt id="grid~4"><a class="permalink" href="#grid~4"><b>grid columnconfigure
    </b><i>master index </i>?<i>-option value...</i>?</a></dt>
  <dd>Query or set the column properties of the <i>index</i> column of the
      geometry master, <i>master</i>. The valid options are <b>-minsize</b>,
      <b>-weight</b>, <b>-uniform</b> and <b>-pad</b>. If one or more options
      are provided, then <i>index</i> may be given as a list of column indices
      to which the configuration options will operate on. Indices may be
      integers, window names or the keyword <i>all</i>. For <i>all</i> the
      options apply to all columns currently occupied be slave windows. For a
      window name, that window must be a slave of this master and the options
      apply to all columns currently occupied be the slave. The <b>-minsize</b>
      option sets the minimum size, in screen units, that will be permitted for
      this column. The <b>-weight</b> option (an integer value) sets the
      relative weight for apportioning any extra spaces among columns. A weight
      of zero (0) indicates the column will not deviate from its requested size.
      A column whose weight is two will grow at twice the rate as a column of
      weight one when extra space is allocated to the layout. The
      <b>-uniform</b> option, when a non-empty value is supplied, places the
      column in a <i>uniform group</i> with other columns that have the same
      value for <b>-uniform</b>. The space for columns belonging to a uniform
      group is allocated so that their sizes are always in strict proportion to
      their <b>-weight</b> values. See <b>THE GRID ALGORITHM</b> below for
      further details. The <b>-pad</b> option specifies the number of screen
      units that will be added to the largest window contained completely in
      that column when the grid geometry manager requests a size from the
      containing window. If only an option is specified, with no value, the
      current value of that option is returned. If only the master window and
      index is specified, all the current settings are returned in a list of
      &#x201C;-option value&#x201D; pairs.</dd>
  <dt id="grid~5"><a class="permalink" href="#grid~5"><b>grid configure

  <dd>The arguments consist of the names of one or more slave windows followed
      by pairs of arguments that specify how to manage the slaves. The
      characters <b>-</b>, <b>x</b> and <b>^</b>, can be specified instead of a
      window name to alter the default location of a <i>slave</i>, as described
      in the <b>RELATIVE PLACEMENT</b> section, below. The following options are
      supported:</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">

  <dd>Insert the slave so that it occupies the <i>n</i>th column in the grid.
      Column numbers start with 0. If this option is not supplied, then the
      slave is arranged just to the right of previous slave specified on this
      call to <b>grid</b>, or column &#x201C;0&#x201D; if it is the first slave.
      For each <b>x</b> that immediately precedes the <i>slave</i>, the column
      position is incremented by one. Thus the <b>x</b> represents a blank
      column for this row in the grid.</dd>
  <dt id="columnspan"><a class="permalink" href="#columnspan"><b>-columnspan
    </b><i>n</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Insert the slave so that it occupies <i>n</i> columns in the grid. The
      default is one column, unless the window name is followed by a <b>-</b>,
      in which case the columnspan is incremented once for each immediately
      following <b>-</b>.</dd>
  <dt id="in"><a class="permalink" href="#in"><b>-in </b><i>other</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Insert the slave(s) in the master window given by <i>other</i>. The
      default is the first slave's parent window.</dd>
  <dt id="ipadx"><a class="permalink" href="#ipadx"><b>-ipadx
    </b><i>amount</i></a></dt>
  <dd>The <i>amount</i> specifies how much horizontal internal padding to leave
      on each side of the slave(s). This is space is added inside the slave(s)
      border. The <i>amount</i> must be a valid screen distance, such as
      <b>2</b> or <b>.5c</b>. It defaults to 0.</dd>
  <dt id="ipady"><a class="permalink" href="#ipady"><b>-ipady
    </b><i>amount</i></a></dt>
  <dd>The <i>amount</i> specifies how much vertical internal padding to leave on

      slave(s) border. The <i>amount</i> defaults to 0.</dd>
  <dt id="padx"><a class="permalink" href="#padx"><b>-padx
    </b><i>amount</i></a></dt>
  <dd>The <i>amount</i> specifies how much horizontal external padding to leave
      on each side of the slave(s), in screen units. <i>Amount</i> may be a list
      of two values to specify padding for left and right separately. The
      <i>amount</i> defaults to 0. This space is added outside the slave(s)
      border.</dd>
  <dt id="pady"><a class="permalink" href="#pady"><b>-pady
    </b><i>amount</i></a></dt>
  <dd>The <i>amount</i> specifies how much vertical external padding to leave on
      the top and bottom of the slave(s), in screen units. <i>Amount</i> may be
      a list of two values to specify padding for top and bottom separately. The
      <i>amount</i> defaults to 0. This space is added outside the slave(s)
      border.</dd>
  <dt id="row"><a class="permalink" href="#row"><b>-row </b><i>n</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Insert the slave so that it occupies the <i>n</i>th row in the grid. Row
      numbers start with 0. If this option is not supplied, then the slave is
      arranged on the same row as the previous slave specified on this call to
      <b>grid</b>, or the first unoccupied row if this is the first slave.</dd>
  <dt id="rowspan"><a class="permalink" href="#rowspan"><b>-rowspan
    </b><i>n</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Insert the slave so that it occupies <i>n</i> rows in the grid. The
      default is one row. If the next <b>grid</b> command contains <b>^</b>
      characters instead of <i>slaves</i> that line up with the columns of this
      <i>slave</i>, then the <b>rowspan</b> of this <i>slave</i> is extended by
      one.</dd>
  <dt id="sticky"><a class="permalink" href="#sticky"><b>-sticky
    </b><i>style</i></a></dt>
  <dd>If a slave's cell is larger than its requested dimensions, this option may
      be used to position (or stretch) the slave within its cell. <i>Style</i>
      is a string that contains zero or more of the characters <b>n</b>,
      <b>s</b>, <b>e</b> or <b>w</b>. The string can optionally contains spaces
      or commas, but they are ignored. Each letter refers to a side (north,
      south, east, or west) that the slave will &#x201C;stick&#x201D; to. If
      both <b>n</b> and <b>s</b> (or <b>e</b> and <b>w</b>) are specified, the
      slave will be stretched to fill the entire height (or width) of its
      cavity. The <b>sticky</b> option subsumes the combination of
      <b>-anchor</b> and <b>-fill</b> that is used by <b>pack</b>. The default
      is &#x201C;&#x201D;, which causes the slave to be centered in its cavity,
      at its requested size.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">If any of the slaves are already managed by the geometry manager
    then any unspecified options for them retain their previous values rather

      (see <b>GEOMETRY PROPAGATION</b> below). If <i>boolean</i> has a false
      boolean value then propagation is disabled for <i>master</i>. In either of
      these cases an empty string is returned. If <i>boolean</i> is omitted then

      are provided, then <i>index</i> may be given as a list of row indices to
      which the configuration options will operate on. Indices may be integers,
      window names or the keyword <i>all</i>. For <i>all</i> the options apply
      to all rows currently occupied be slave windows. For a window name, that
      window must be a slave of this master and the options apply to all rows
      currently occupied be the slave. The <b>-minsize</b> option sets the
      minimum size, in screen units, that will be permitted for this row. The
      <b>-weight</b> option (an integer value) sets the relative weight for
      apportioning any extra spaces among rows. A weight of zero (0) indicates
      the row will not deviate from its requested size. A row whose weight is
      two will grow at twice the rate as a row of weight one when extra space is
      allocated to the layout. The <b>-uniform</b> option, when a non-empty
      value is supplied, places the row in a <i>uniform group</i> with other
      rows that have the same value for <b>-uniform</b>. The space for rows
      belonging to a uniform group is allocated so that their sizes are always
      in strict proportion to their <b>-weight</b> values. See <b>THE GRID

      the number of screen units that will be added to the largest window
      contained completely in that row when the grid geometry manager requests a
      size from the containing window. If only an option is specified, with no
      value, the current value of that option is returned. If only the master

<p class="Pp">The <b>grid</b> command contains a limited set of capabilities
    that permit layouts to be created without specifying the row and column
    information for each slave. This permits slaves to be rearranged, added, or

    When no column or row information is specified for a <i>slave</i>, default
    values are chosen for <b>column</b>, <b>row</b>, <b>columnspan</b> and

<h1 class="Sh" id="THE_GRID_ALGORITHM"><a class="permalink" href="#THE_GRID_ALGORITHM">THE
  GRID ALGORITHM</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The grid geometry manager lays out its slaves in three steps. In
    the first step, the minimum size needed to fit all of the slaves is
    computed, then (if propagation is turned on), a request is made of the
    master window to become that size. In the second step, the requested size is
    compared against the actual size of the master. If the sizes are different,
    then spaces is added to or taken away from the layout as needed. For the
    final step, each slave is positioned in its row(s) and column(s) based on
    the setting of its <i>sticky</i> flag.</p>
<p class="Pp">To compute the minimum size of a layout, the grid geometry manager
    first looks at all slaves whose columnspan and rowspan values are one, and
    computes the nominal size of each row or column to be either the
    <i>minsize</i> for that row or column, or the sum of the <i>pad</i>ding plus
    the size of the largest slave, whichever is greater. After that the rows or
    columns in each uniform group adapt to each other. Then the slaves whose
    rowspans or columnspans are greater than one are examined. If a group of
    rows or columns need to be increased in size in order to accommodate these
    slaves, then extra space is added to each row or column in the group
    according to its <i>weight</i>. For each group whose weights are all zero,
    the additional space is apportioned equally.</p>
<p class="Pp">When multiple rows or columns belong to a uniform group, the space
    allocated to them is always in proportion to their weights. (A weight of
    zero is considered to be 1.) In other words, a row or column configured with
    <b>-weight 1 -uniform a</b> will have exactly the same size as any other row
    or column configured with <b>-weight 1 -uniform</b> <b>a</b>. A row or
    column configured with <b>-weight 2 -uniform b</b> will be exactly twice as
    large as one that is configured with <b>-weight 1</b> <b>-uniform b</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">More technically, each row or column in the group will have a size
    equal to <i>k*weight</i> for some constant <i>k</i>. The constant <i>k</i>
    is chosen so that no row or column becomes smaller than its minimum size.
    For example, if all rows or columns in a group have the same weight, then
    each row or column will have the same size as the largest row or column in
    the group.</p>
<p class="Pp">For masters whose size is larger than the requested layout, the
    additional space is apportioned according to the row and column weights. If
    all of the weights are zero, the layout is placed within its master
    according to the <i>anchor</i> value. For masters whose size is smaller than
    the requested layout, space is taken away from columns and rows according to
    their weights. However, once a column or row shrinks to its minsize, its
    weight is taken to be zero. If more space needs to be removed from a layout
    than would be permitted, as when all the rows or columns are at their
    minimum sizes, the layout is placed and clipped according to the
    <i>anchor</i> value.</p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="GEOMETRY_PROPAGATION"><a class="permalink" href="#GEOMETRY_PROPAGATION">GEOMETRY
  PROPAGATION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The grid geometry manager normally computes how large a master
    must be to just exactly meet the needs of its slaves, and it sets the
    requested width and height of the master to these dimensions. This causes
    geometry information to propagate up through a window hierarchy to a
    top-level window so that the entire sub-tree sizes itself to fit the needs
    of the leaf windows. However, the <b>grid propagate</b> command may be used
    to turn off propagation for one or more masters. If propagation is disabled
    then grid will not set the requested width and height of the master window.
    This may be useful if, for example, you wish for a master window to have a

<p class="Pp">The master for each slave must either be the slave's parent (the
    default) or a descendant of the slave's parent. This restriction is
    necessary to guarantee that the slave can be placed over any part of its
    master that is visible without danger of the slave being clipped by its
    parent. In addition, all slaves in one call to <b>grid</b> must have the
    same master.</p>

<p class="Pp">If the master for a slave is not its parent then you must make
    sure that the slave is higher in the stacking order than the master.
    Otherwise the master will obscure the slave and it will appear as if the
    slave has not been managed correctly. The easiest way to make sure the slave
    is higher than the master is to create the master window first: the most
    recently created window will be highest in the stacking order.</p>
