<p class="Pp"><code class="Nm">ssh-copy-id</code> is a script that uses
    <a class="Xr">ssh(1)</a> to log into a remote machine (presumably using a
    login password, so password authentication should be enabled, unless you've
    done some clever use of multiple identities). It assembles a list of one or
    more fingerprints (as described below) and tries to log in with each key, to
    see if any of them are already installed (of course, if you are not using
    <a class="Xr">ssh-agent(1)</a> this may result in you being repeatedly
    prompted for pass-phrases). It then assembles a list of those that failed to
    log in and, using <a class="Xr">ssh(1)</a>, enables logins with those keys
    on the remote server. By default it adds the keys by appending them to the
    remote user's <span class="Pa">~/.ssh/authorized_keys</span> (creating the
    file, and directory, if necessary). It is also capable of detecting if the
    remote system is a NetScreen, and using its &#x2018;<code class="Li">set ssh
    pka-dsa key ...</code>&#x2019; command instead.</p>
<p class="Pp">The options are as follows:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="i"><a class="permalink" href="#i"><code class="Fl">-i</code></a>
    [<var class="Ar">identity_file</var>]</dt>
  <dd>Use only the key(s) contained in <var class="Ar">identity_file</var>
      (rather than looking for identities via <a class="Xr">ssh-add(1)</a> or in
      the <code class="Ic">default_ID_file</code>). If the filename does not end
      in <span class="Pa">.pub</span> this is added. If the filename is omitted,
      the <code class="Ic">default_ID_file</code> is used.
    <p class="Pp">Note that this can be used to ensure that the keys copied have
        the comment one prefers and/or extra options applied, by ensuring that
        the key file has these set as preferred before the copy is
      attempted.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="f"><a class="permalink" href="#f"><code class="Fl">-f</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Forced mode: doesn't check if the keys are present on the remote server.
      This means that it does not need the private key. Of course, this can
      result in more than one copy of the key being installed on the remote
      system.</dd>
  <dt id="n"><a class="permalink" href="#n"><code class="Fl">-n</code></a></dt>
  <dd>do a dry-run. Instead of installing keys on the remote system simply
      prints the key(s) that would have been installed.</dd>
  <dt id="s"><a class="permalink" href="#s"><code class="Fl">-s</code></a></dt>
  <dd>SFTP mode: usually the public keys are installed by executing commands on
      the remote side. With this option the user's
      <span class="Pa">~/.ssh/authorized_keys</span> file will be downloaded,
      modified locally and uploaded with sftp. This option is useful if the
      server has restrictions on commands which can be used on the remote
    side.</dd>
  <dt id="t"><a class="permalink" href="#t"><code class="Fl">-t</code></a>
    <var class="Ar">target_path</var></dt>
  <dd>the path on the target system where the keys should be added (defaults to
      &quot;.ssh/authorized_keys&quot;)</dd>
  <dt id="p"><a class="permalink" href="#p"><code class="Fl">-p</code></a>
    <var class="Ar">port</var></dt>
  <dd>Specifies the port to connect to on the remote host.</dd>
  <dt id="F"><a class="permalink" href="#F"><code class="Fl">-F</code></a>
    <var class="Ar">ssh_config</var>, <code class="Fl">-o</code>
    <var class="Ar">ssh_option</var></dt>
  <dd>These options are simply passed through untouched (with their argument) to
      ssh/sftp, allowing one to set an alternative config file, or other
      options, respectively.
    <p class="Pp">Rather than specifying these as command line options, it is
        often better to use (per-host) settings in <a class="Xr">ssh(1)</a>'s
        configuration file: <a class="Xr">ssh_config(5)</a>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="x"><a class="permalink" href="#x"><code class="Fl">-x</code></a></dt>
  <dd>This option is for debugging the <code class="Nm">ssh-copy-id</code>
      script itself. It sets the shell's -x flag, so that you can see the
      commands being run.</dd>
  <dt id="h"><a class="permalink" href="#h"><code class="Fl">-h</code></a>,
    <code class="Fl">-</code>?</dt>
  <dd>Print Usage summary</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Default behaviour without <code class="Fl">-i</code>, is to check
    if &#x2018;<code class="Li">ssh-add -L</code>&#x2019; provides any output,
    and if so those keys are used. Note that this results in the comment on the
    key being the filename that was given to <a class="Xr">ssh-add(1)</a> when
    the key was loaded into your <a class="Xr">ssh-agent(1)</a> rather than the
    comment contained in that file, which is a bit of a shame. Otherwise, if
    <a class="Xr">ssh-add(1)</a> provides no keys contents of the
    <code class="Ic">default_ID_file</code> will be used.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <code class="Ic">default_ID_file</code> is the most recent
    file that matches: <span class="Pa">~/.ssh/id*.pub</span>, (excluding those
    that match <span class="Pa">~/.ssh/*-cert.pub</span>) so if you create a key
    that is not the one you want <code class="Nm">ssh-copy-id</code> to use,
    just use <a class="Xr">touch(1)</a> on your preferred key's
    <span class="Pa">.pub</span> file to reinstate it as the most recent.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="EXAMPLES"><a class="permalink" href="#EXAMPLES">EXAMPLES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">If you have already installed keys from one system on a lot of
    remote hosts, and you then create a new key, on a new client machine, say,
    it can be difficult to keep track of which systems on which you've installed
    the new key. One way of dealing with this is to load both the new key and
    old key(s) into your <a class="Xr">ssh-agent(1)</a>. Load the new key first,
    without the <code class="Fl">-c</code> option, then load one or more old
    keys into the agent, possibly by ssh-ing to the client machine that has that
    old key, using the <code class="Fl">-A</code> option to allow agent
    forwarding:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd Bd-indent">user@newclient$ ssh-add</div>
<div class="Bd Bd-indent">user@newclient$ ssh -A old.client</div>
<div class="Bd Bd-indent">user@oldl$ ssh-add -c</div>
<div class="Bd Bd-indent"><span class="No">... prompt for pass-phrase
  ...</span></div>
<div class="Bd Bd-indent">user@old$ logoff</div>
<div class="Bd Bd-indent">user@newclient$ ssh someserver</div>
<p class="Pp">now, if the new key is installed on the server, you'll be allowed
    in unprompted, whereas if you only have the old key(s) enabled, you'll be
    asked for confirmation, which is your cue to log back out and run</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd Bd-indent">user@newclient$ ssh-copy-id -i someserver</div>
<p class="Pp">The reason you might want to specify the
    <code class="Fl">-i</code> option in this case is to ensure that the comment
    on the installed key is the one from the <span class="Pa">.pub</span> file,
    rather than just the filename that was loaded into your agent. It also
    ensures that only the id you intended is installed, rather than all the keys
    that you have in your <a class="Xr">ssh-agent(1)</a>. Of course, you can
    specify another id, or use the contents of the
    <a class="Xr">ssh-agent(1)</a> as you prefer.</p>
<p class="Pp">Having mentioned <a class="Xr">ssh-add(1)</a>'s
    <code class="Fl">-c</code> option, you might consider using this whenever
    using agent forwarding to avoid your key being hijacked, but it is much
    better to instead use <a class="Xr">ssh(1)</a>'s
    <var class="Ar">ProxyCommand</var> and <code class="Fl">-W</code> option, to
    bounce through remote servers while always doing direct end-to-end
    authentication. This way the middle hop(s) don't get access to your
    <a class="Xr">ssh-agent(1)</a>. A web search for
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">ssh proxycommand nc</code>&#x2019; should prove
    enlightening (NB the modern approach is to use the
    <code class="Fl">-W</code> option, rather than <a class="Xr">nc(1)</a>).</p>
