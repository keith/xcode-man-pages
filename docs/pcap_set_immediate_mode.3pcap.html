<b>pcap_set_immediate_mode()</b> sets whether immediate mode should be set on a
  capture handle when the handle is activated. In immediate mode, packets are
  always delivered as soon as they arrive, with no buffering. If
  <i>immediate_mode</i> is non-zero, immediate mode will be set, otherwise it
  will not be set.

<b>pcap_set_immediate_mode()</b> returns 0 on success or
  <b>PCAP_ERROR_ACTIVATED</b> if called on a capture handle that has been
  activated.

This function became available in libpcap release 1.5.0. In previous releases,
  if immediate delivery of packets is required:

  <dt></dt>
  <dd>on FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, DragonFly BSD, macOS, and Solaris 11,
      immediate mode must be turned on with a <b>BIOCIMMEDIATE</b>
      <b>ioctl</b>(2), as documented in <b>bpf(@MAN_DEVICES@)</b>, on the
      descriptor returned by <b>pcap_fileno(3PCAP),</b> after
      <b>pcap_activate(3PCAP)</b> is called;</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>on Solaris 10 and earlier versions of Solaris, immediate mode must be
      turned on by using a read timeout of 0 when opening the device (this will
      not provide immediate delivery of packets on other platforms, so don't
      assume it's sufficient);</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>on Digital UNIX/Tru64 UNIX, immediate mode must be turned on by doing a
      <b>BIOCMBIC</b> <b>ioctl</b>, as documented in <b>packetfilter(7)</b>, to
      clear the <b>ENBATCH</b> flag on the descriptor returned by
      <b>pcap_fileno(3PCAP),</b> after <b>pcap_activate(3PCAP)</b> is
    called;</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>on Windows, immediate mode must be turned on by calling
      <b>pcap_setmintocopy()</b> with a size of 0.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">On Linux, with previous releases of libpcap, capture devices are
    always in immediate mode; however, in 1.5.0 and later, they are, by default,
    <b>not</b> in immediate mode, so if <b>pcap_set_immediate_mode()</b> is
    available, it should be used.</p>
<p class="Pp">On other platforms, capture devices are always in immediate
  mode.</p>
