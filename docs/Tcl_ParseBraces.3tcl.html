   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

These procedures parse Tcl commands or portions of Tcl commands such as
  expressions or references to variables. Each procedure takes a pointer to a
  script (or portion thereof) and fills in the structure pointed to by
  <i>parsePtr</i> with a collection of tokens describing the information that
  was parsed. The procedures normally return <b>TCL_OK</b>. However, if an error
  occurs then they return <b>TCL_ERROR</b>, leave an error message in
  <i>interp</i>'s result (if <i>interp</i> is not NULL), and leave nothing in
  <i>parsePtr</i>.
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_ParseCommand</b> is a procedure that parses Tcl scripts.
    Given a pointer to a script, it parses the first command from the script. If
    the command was parsed successfully, <b>Tcl_ParseCommand</b> returns
    <b>TCL_OK</b> and fills in the structure pointed to by <i>parsePtr</i> with
    information about the structure of the command (see below for details). If
    an error occurred in parsing the command then <b>TCL_ERROR</b> is returned,
    an error message is left in <i>interp</i>'s result, and no information is
    left at <i>*parsePtr</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_ParseExpr</b> parses Tcl expressions. Given a pointer to a
    script containing an expression, <b>Tcl_ParseExpr</b> parses the expression.
    If the expression was parsed successfully, <b>Tcl_ParseExpr</b> returns
    <b>TCL_OK</b> and fills in the structure pointed to by <i>parsePtr</i> with
    information about the structure of the expression (see below for details).
    If an error occurred in parsing the command then <b>TCL_ERROR</b> is
    returned, an error message is left in <i>interp</i>'s result, and no
    information is left at <i>*parsePtr</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_ParseBraces</b> parses a string or command argument
    enclosed in braces such as <b>{hello}</b> or <b>{string \t with \t tabs}</b>
    from the beginning of its argument <i>start</i>. The first character of
    <i>start</i> must be <b>{</b>. If the braced string was parsed successfully,
    <b>Tcl_ParseBraces</b> returns <b>TCL_OK</b>, fills in the structure pointed
    to by <i>parsePtr</i> with information about the structure of the string
    (see below for details), and stores a pointer to the character just after
    the terminating <b>}</b> in the location given by <i>*termPtr</i>. If an
    error occurs while parsing the string then <b>TCL_ERROR</b> is returned, an
    error message is left in <i>interp</i>'s result, and no information is left
    at <i>*parsePtr</i> or <i>*termPtr</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_ParseQuotedString</b> parses a double-quoted string such as
    <b>&quot;sum is [expr {$a+$b}]&quot;</b> from the beginning of the argument
    <i>start</i>. The first character of <i>start</i> must be <b>&quot;</b>. If
    the double-quoted string was parsed successfully,
    <b>Tcl_ParseQuotedString</b> returns <b>TCL_OK</b>, fills in the structure
    pointed to by <i>parsePtr</i> with information about the structure of the
    string (see below for details), and stores a pointer to the character just
    after the terminating <b>&quot;</b> in the location given by
    <i>*termPtr</i>. If an error occurs while parsing the string then
    <b>TCL_ERROR</b> is returned, an error message is left in <i>interp</i>'s
    result, and no information is left at <i>*parsePtr</i> or
  <i>*termPtr</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_ParseVarName</b> parses a Tcl variable reference such as
    <b>$abc</b> or <b>$x([expr {$index + 1}])</b> from the beginning of its
    <i>start</i> argument. The first character of <i>start</i> must be <b>$</b>.
    If a variable name was parsed successfully, <b>Tcl_ParseVarName</b> returns
    <b>TCL_OK</b> and fills in the structure pointed to by <i>parsePtr</i> with
    information about the structure of the variable name (see below for
    details). If an error occurs while parsing the command then <b>TCL_ERROR</b>
    is returned, an error message is left in <i>interp</i>'s result (if
    <i>interp</i> is not NULL), and no information is left at
  <i>*parsePtr</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_ParseVar</b> parse a Tcl variable reference such as
    <b>$abc</b> or <b>$x([expr {$index + 1}])</b> from the beginning of its
    <i>start</i> argument. The first character of <i>start</i> must be <b>$</b>.
    If the variable name is parsed successfully, <b>Tcl_ParseVar</b> returns a
    pointer to the string value of the variable. If an error occurs while
    parsing, then NULL is returned and an error message is left in
    <i>interp</i>'s result.</p>
<p class="Pp">The information left at <i>*parsePtr</i> by
    <b>Tcl_ParseCommand</b>, <b>Tcl_ParseExpr</b>, <b>Tcl_ParseBraces</b>,
    <b>Tcl_ParseQuotedString</b>, and <b>Tcl_ParseVarName</b> may include
    dynamically allocated memory. If these five parsing procedures return
    <b>TCL_OK</b> then the caller must invoke <b>Tcl_FreeParse</b> to release
    the storage at <i>*parsePtr</i>. These procedures ignore any existing
    information in <i>*parsePtr</i> (unless <i>append</i> is non-zero), so if
    repeated calls are being made to any of them then <b>Tcl_FreeParse</b> must
    be invoked once after each call.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_EvalTokensStandard</b> evaluates a sequence of parse tokens
    from a Tcl_Parse structure. The tokens typically consist of all the tokens
    in a word or all the tokens that make up the index for a reference to an
    array variable. <b>Tcl_EvalTokensStandard</b> performs the substitutions
    requested by the tokens and concatenates the resulting values. The return
    value from <b>Tcl_EvalTokensStandard</b> is a Tcl completion code with one
    of the values <b>TCL_OK</b>, <b>TCL_ERROR</b>, <b>TCL_RETURN</b>,
    <b>TCL_BREAK</b>, or <b>TCL_CONTINUE</b>, or possibly some other integer
    value originating in an extension. In addition, a result value or error
    message is left in <i>interp</i>'s result; it can be retrieved using
    <b>Tcl_GetObjResult</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_EvalTokens</b> differs from <b>Tcl_EvalTokensStandard</b>
    only in the return convention used: it returns the result in a new Tcl_Obj.
    The reference count of the object returned as result has been incremented,
    so the caller must invoke <b>Tcl_DecrRefCount</b> when it is finished with
    the object. If an error or other exception occurs while evaluating the
    tokens (such as a reference to a non-existent variable) then the return
    value is NULL and an error message is left in <i>interp</i>'s result. The
    use of <b>Tcl_EvalTokens</b> is deprecated.</p>

<b>Tcl_ParseCommand</b>, <b>Tcl_ParseExpr</b>, <b>Tcl_ParseBraces</b>,
  <b>Tcl_ParseQuotedString</b>, and <b>Tcl_ParseVarName</b> return parse
  information in two data structures, Tcl_Parse and Tcl_Token:
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
typedef struct Tcl_Parse {
        const char *<i>commentStart</i>;
        int <i>commentSize</i>;
        const char *<i>commandStart</i>;
        int <i>commandSize</i>;
        int <i>numWords</i>;
        Tcl_Token *<i>tokenPtr</i>;
        int <i>numTokens</i>;
        ...
} Tcl_Parse;
typedef struct Tcl_Token {
        int <i>type</i>;
        const char *<i>start</i>;
        int <i>size</i>;
        int <i>numComponents</i>;
} Tcl_Token;
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The first five fields of a Tcl_Parse structure are filled in only
    by <b>Tcl_ParseCommand</b>. These fields are not used by the other parsing
    procedures.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_ParseCommand</b> fills in a Tcl_Parse structure with
    information that describes one Tcl command and any comments that precede the
    command. If there are comments, the <i>commentStart</i> field points to the
    <b>#</b> character that begins the first comment and <i>commentSize</i>
    indicates the number of bytes in all of the comments preceding the command,
    including the newline character that terminates the last comment. If the
    command is not preceded by any comments, <i>commentSize</i> is 0.
    <b>Tcl_ParseCommand</b> also sets the <i>commandStart</i> field to point to
    the first character of the first word in the command (skipping any comments
    and leading space) and <i>commandSize</i> gives the total number of bytes in
    the command, including the character pointed to by <i>commandStart</i> up to
    and including the newline, close bracket, or semicolon character that
    terminates the command. The <i>numWords</i> field gives the total number of
    words in the command.</p>
<p class="Pp">All parsing procedures set the remaining fields, <i>tokenPtr</i>
    and <i>numTokens</i>. The <i>tokenPtr</i> field points to the first in an
    array of Tcl_Token structures that describe the components of the entity
    being parsed. The <i>numTokens</i> field gives the total number of tokens
    present in the array. Each token contains four fields. The <i>type</i> field
    selects one of several token types that are described below. The
    <i>start</i> field points to the first character in the token and the
    <i>size</i> field gives the total number of characters in the token. Some
    token types, such as <b>TCL_TOKEN_WORD</b> and <b>TCL_TOKEN_VARIABLE</b>,
    consist of several component tokens, which immediately follow the parent
    token; the <i>numComponents</i> field describes how many of these there are.
    The <i>type</i> field has one of the following values:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>TCL_TOKEN_WORD</b></dt>
  <dd>This token ordinarily describes one word of a command but it may also
      describe a quoted or braced string in an expression. The token describes a
      component of the script that is the result of concatenating together a
      sequence of subcomponents, each described by a separate subtoken. The
      token starts with the first non-blank character of the component (which
      may be a double-quote or open brace) and includes all characters in the
      component up to but not including the space, semicolon, close bracket,
      close quote, or close brace that terminates the component. The
      <i>numComponents</i> field counts the total number of sub-tokens that make
      up the word, including sub-tokens of <b>TCL_TOKEN_VARIABLE</b> and
      <b>TCL_TOKEN_BS</b> tokens.</dd>
  <dt><b>TCL_TOKEN_SIMPLE_WORD</b></dt>
  <dd>This token has the same meaning as <b>TCL_TOKEN_WORD</b>, except that the
      word is guaranteed to consist of a single <b>TCL_TOKEN_TEXT</b> sub-token.
      The <i>numComponents</i> field is always 1.</dd>
  <dt><b>TCL_TOKEN_EXPAND_WORD</b></dt>
  <dd>This token has the same meaning as <b>TCL_TOKEN_WORD</b>, except that the
      command parser notes this word began with the expansion prefix <b>{*}</b>,
      indicating that after substitution, the list value of this word should be
      expanded to form multiple arguments in command evaluation. This token type
      can only be created by Tcl_ParseCommand.</dd>
  <dt><b>TCL_TOKEN_TEXT</b></dt>
  <dd>The token describes a range of literal text that is part of a word. The
      <i>numComponents</i> field is always 0.</dd>
  <dt><b>TCL_TOKEN_BS</b></dt>
  <dd>The token describes a backslash sequence such as <b>\n</b> or
      <b>\0xa3</b>. The <i>numComponents</i> field is always 0.</dd>
  <dt><b>TCL_TOKEN_COMMAND</b></dt>
  <dd>The token describes a command whose result must be substituted into the
      word. The token includes the square brackets that surround the command.
      The <i>numComponents</i> field is always 0 (the nested command is not
      parsed; call <b>Tcl_ParseCommand</b> recursively if you want to see its
      tokens).</dd>
  <dt><b>TCL_TOKEN_VARIABLE</b></dt>
  <dd>The token describes a variable substitution, including the <b>$</b>,
      variable name, and array index (if there is one) up through the close
      parenthesis that terminates the index. This token is followed by one or
      more additional tokens that describe the variable name and array index. If
      <i>numComponents</i> is 1 then the variable is a scalar and the next token
      is a <b>TCL_TOKEN_TEXT</b> token that gives the variable name. If
      <i>numComponents</i> is greater than 1 then the variable is an array: the
      first sub-token is a <b>TCL_TOKEN_TEXT</b> token giving the array name and
      the remaining sub-tokens are <b>TCL_TOKEN_TEXT</b>, <b>TCL_TOKEN_BS</b>,
      <b>TCL_TOKEN_COMMAND</b>, and <b>TCL_TOKEN_VARIABLE</b> tokens that must
      be concatenated to produce the array index. The <i>numComponents</i> field
      includes nested sub-tokens that are part of <b>TCL_TOKEN_VARIABLE</b>
      tokens in the array index.</dd>
  <dt><b>TCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR</b></dt>
  <dd>The token describes one subexpression of an expression (or an entire
      expression). A subexpression may consist of a value such as an integer
      literal, variable substitution, or parenthesized subexpression; it may
      also consist of an operator and its operands. The token starts with the
      first non-blank character of the subexpression up to but not including the
      space, brace, close-paren, or bracket that terminates the subexpression.
      This token is followed by one or more additional tokens that describe the
      subexpression. If the first sub-token after the <b>TCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR</b>
      token is a <b>TCL_TOKEN_OPERATOR</b> token, the subexpression consists of
      an operator and its token operands. If the operator has no operands, the
      subexpression consists of just the <b>TCL_TOKEN_OPERATOR</b> token. Each
      operand is described by a <b>TCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR</b> token. Otherwise, the
      subexpression is a value described by one of the token types
      <b>TCL_TOKEN_WORD</b>, <b>TCL_TOKEN_TEXT</b>, <b>TCL_TOKEN_BS</b>,
      <b>TCL_TOKEN_COMMAND</b>, <b>TCL_TOKEN_VARIABLE</b>, and
      <b>TCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR</b>. The <i>numComponents</i> field counts the total
      number of sub-tokens that make up the subexpression; this includes the
      sub-tokens for any nested <b>TCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR</b> tokens.</dd>
  <dt><b>TCL_TOKEN_OPERATOR</b></dt>
  <dd>The token describes one operator of an expression such as
      <b>&amp;&amp;</b> or <b>hypot</b>. A <b>TCL_TOKEN_OPERATOR</b> token is
      always preceded by a <b>TCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR</b> token that describes the
      operator and its operands; the <b>TCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR</b> token's
      <i>numComponents</i> field can be used to determine the number of
      operands. A binary operator such as <b>*</b> is followed by two
      <b>TCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR</b> tokens that describe its operands. A unary
      operator like <b>-</b> is followed by a single <b>TCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR</b>
      token for its operand. If the operator is a math function such as
      <b>log10</b>, the <b>TCL_TOKEN_OPERATOR</b> token will give its name and
      the following <b>TCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR</b> tokens will describe its operands;
      if there are no operands (as with <b>rand</b>), no
      <b>TCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR</b> tokens follow. There is one trinary operator,
      <b>?</b>, that appears in if-then-else subexpressions such as
      <i>x</i><b>?</b> <i>y</i><b>:</b><i>z</i>; in this case, the <b>?</b>
      <b>TCL_TOKEN_OPERATOR</b> token is followed by three
      <b>TCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR</b> tokens for the operands <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, and
      <i>z</i>. The <i>numComponents</i> field for a <b>TCL_TOKEN_OPERATOR</b>
      token is always 0.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">After <b>Tcl_ParseCommand</b> returns, the first token pointed to
    by the <i>tokenPtr</i> field of the Tcl_Parse structure always has type
    <b>TCL_TOKEN_WORD</b> or <b>TCL_TOKEN_SIMPLE_WORD</b> or
    <b>TCL_TOKEN_EXPAND_WORD</b>. It is followed by the sub-tokens that must be
    concatenated to produce the value of that word. The next token is the
    <b>TCL_TOKEN_WORD</b> or <b>TCL_TOKEN_SIMPLE_WORD</b> of
    <b>TCL_TOKEN_EXPAND_WORD</b> token for the second word, followed by
    sub-tokens for that word, and so on until all <i>numWords</i> have been
    accounted for.</p>
<p class="Pp">After <b>Tcl_ParseExpr</b> returns, the first token pointed to by
    the <i>tokenPtr</i> field of the Tcl_Parse structure always has type
    <b>TCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR</b>. It is followed by the sub-tokens that must be
    evaluated to produce the value of the expression. Only the token information
    in the Tcl_Parse structure is modified: the <i>commentStart</i>,
    <i>commentSize</i>, <i>commandStart</i>, and <i>commandSize</i> fields are
    not modified by <b>Tcl_ParseExpr</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">After <b>Tcl_ParseBraces</b> returns, the array of tokens pointed
    to by the <i>tokenPtr</i> field of the Tcl_Parse structure will contain a
    single <b>TCL_TOKEN_TEXT</b> token if the braced string does not contain any
    backslash-newlines. If the string does contain backslash-newlines, the array
    of tokens will contain one or more <b>TCL_TOKEN_TEXT</b> or
    <b>TCL_TOKEN_BS</b> sub-tokens that must be concatenated to produce the
    value of the string. If the braced string was just <b>{}</b> (that is, the
    string was empty), the single <b>TCL_TOKEN_TEXT</b> token will have a
    <i>size</i> field containing zero; this ensures that at least one token
    appears to describe the braced string. Only the token information in the
    Tcl_Parse structure is modified: the <i>commentStart</i>,
    <i>commentSize</i>, <i>commandStart</i>, and <i>commandSize</i> fields are
    not modified by <b>Tcl_ParseBraces</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">After <b>Tcl_ParseQuotedString</b> returns, the array of tokens
    pointed to by the <i>tokenPtr</i> field of the Tcl_Parse structure depends
    on the contents of the quoted string. It will consist of one or more
    <b>TCL_TOKEN_TEXT</b>, <b>TCL_TOKEN_BS</b>, <b>TCL_TOKEN_COMMAND</b>, and
    <b>TCL_TOKEN_VARIABLE</b> sub-tokens. The array always contains at least one
    token; for example, if the argument <i>start</i> is empty, the array
    returned consists of a single <b>TCL_TOKEN_TEXT</b> token with a zero
    <i>size</i> field. Only the token information in the Tcl_Parse structure is
    modified: the <i>commentStart</i>, <i>commentSize</i>, <i>commandStart</i>,
    and <i>commandSize</i> fields are not modified.</p>
<p class="Pp">After <b>Tcl_ParseVarName</b> returns, the first token pointed to
    by the <i>tokenPtr</i> field of the Tcl_Parse structure always has type
    <b>TCL_TOKEN_VARIABLE</b>. It is followed by the sub-tokens that make up the
    variable name as described above. The total length of the variable name is
    contained in the <i>size</i> field of the first token. As in
    <b>Tcl_ParseExpr</b>, only the token information in the Tcl_Parse structure
    is modified by <b>Tcl_ParseVarName</b>: the <i>commentStart</i>,
    <i>commentSize</i>, <i>commandStart</i>, and <i>commandSize</i> fields are
    not modified.</p>
<p class="Pp">All of the character pointers in the Tcl_Parse and Tcl_Token
    structures refer to characters in the <i>start</i> argument passed to
    <b>Tcl_ParseCommand</b>, <b>Tcl_ParseExpr</b>, <b>Tcl_ParseBraces</b>,
    <b>Tcl_ParseQuotedString</b>, and <b>Tcl_ParseVarName</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">There are additional fields in the Tcl_Parse structure after the
    <i>numTokens</i> field, but these are for the private use of
    <b>Tcl_ParseCommand</b>, <b>Tcl_ParseExpr</b>, <b>Tcl_ParseBraces</b>,
    <b>Tcl_ParseQuotedString</b>, and <b>Tcl_ParseVarName</b>; they should not
    be referenced by code outside of these procedures.</p>
