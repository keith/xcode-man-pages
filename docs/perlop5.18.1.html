  Precedence and Associativity</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Operator precedence and associativity work in Perl more or less
    like they do in mathematics.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Operator precedence</i> means some operators are evaluated
    before others. For example, in <span class="Li">&quot;2 + 4 *
    5&quot;</span>, the multiplication has higher precedence so
    <span class="Li">&quot;4 * 5&quot;</span> is evaluated first yielding
    <span class="Li">&quot;2 + 20 ==</span> <span class="Li">22&quot;</span> and
    not <span class="Li">&quot;6 * 5 == 30&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Operator associativity</i> defines what happens if a sequence
    of the same operators is used one after another: whether the evaluator will
    evaluate the left operations first or the right. For example, in
    <span class="Li">&quot;8</span> <span class="Li">- 4 - 2&quot;</span>,
    subtraction is left associative so Perl evaluates the expression left to
    right. <span class="Li">&quot;8 - 4&quot;</span> is evaluated first making
    the expression <span class="Li">&quot;4 - 2 == 2&quot;</span> and not
    <span class="Li">&quot;8 - 2 == 6&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl operators have the following associativity and precedence,
    listed from highest precedence to lowest. Operators borrowed from C keep the
    same precedence relationship with each other, even where C's precedence is
    slightly screwy. (This makes learning Perl easier for C folks.) With very
    few exceptions, these all operate on scalar values only, not array
  values.</p>

<p class="Pp">In the following sections, these operators are covered in
    precedence order.</p>
<p class="Pp">Many operators can be overloaded for objects. See overload.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Terms_and_List_Operators_(Leftward)"><a class="permalink" href="#Terms_and_List_Operators_(Leftward)">Terms
  and List Operators (Leftward)</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">A TERM has the highest precedence in Perl. They include variables,
    quote and quote-like operators, any expression in parentheses, and any
    function whose arguments are parenthesized. Actually, there aren't really
    functions in this sense, just list operators and unary operators behaving as
    functions because you put parentheses around the arguments. These are all
    documented in perlfunc.</p>
<p class="Pp">If any list operator (<i>print()</i>, etc.) or any unary operator
    (<i>chdir()</i>, etc.) is followed by a left parenthesis as the next token,
    the operator and arguments within parentheses are taken to be of highest
    precedence, just like a normal function call.</p>
<p class="Pp">In the absence of parentheses, the precedence of list operators
    such as <span class="Li">&quot;print&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;sort&quot;</span>, or
    <span class="Li">&quot;chmod&quot;</span> is either very high or very low
    depending on whether you are looking at the left side or the right side of
    the operator. For example, in</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    @ary = (1, 3, sort 4, 2);
    print @ary;         # prints 1324
</pre>
<p class="Pp">the commas on the right of the sort are evaluated before the sort,
    but the commas on the left are evaluated after. In other words, list
    operators tend to gobble up all arguments that follow, and then act like a
    simple TERM with regard to the preceding expression. Be careful with
    parentheses:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    # These evaluate exit before doing the print:
    print($foo, exit);  # Obviously not what you want.
    print $foo, exit;   # Nor is this.
    # These do the print before evaluating exit:
    (print $foo), exit; # This is what you want.
    print($foo), exit;  # Or this.
    print ($foo), exit; # Or even this.
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Also note that</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    print ($foo &amp; 255) + 1, &quot;\n&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">probably doesn't do what you expect at first glance. The
    parentheses enclose the argument list for
    <span class="Li">&quot;print&quot;</span> which is evaluated (printing the
    result of <span class="Li">&quot;$foo &amp; 255&quot;</span>). Then one is
    added to the return value of <span class="Li">&quot;print&quot;</span>
    (usually 1). The result is something like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    1 + 1, &quot;\n&quot;;    # Obviously not what you meant.
</pre>
<p class="Pp">To do what you meant properly, you must write:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    print(($foo &amp; 255) + 1, &quot;\n&quot;);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">See &quot;Named Unary Operators&quot; for more discussion of
  this.</p>
<p class="Pp">Also parsed as terms are the <span class="Li">&quot;do
    {}&quot;</span> and <span class="Li">&quot;eval {}&quot;</span> constructs,
    as well as subroutine and method calls, and the anonymous constructors
    <span class="Li">&quot;[]&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;{}&quot;</span>.</p>

  Arrow Operator</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">&quot;<span class="Li">&quot;-&gt;&quot;</span>&quot; is an infix
    dereference operator, just as it is in C and C++. If the right side is
    either a <span class="Li">&quot;[...]&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;{...}&quot;</span>, or a
    <span class="Li">&quot;(...)&quot;</span> subscript, then the left side must
    be either a hard or symbolic reference to an array, a hash, or a subroutine
    respectively. (Or technically speaking, a location capable of holding a hard
    reference, if it's an array or hash reference being used for assignment.)
    See perlreftut and perlref.</p>
<p class="Pp">Otherwise, the right side is a method name or a simple scalar
    variable containing either the method name or a subroutine reference, and
    the left side must be either an object (a blessed reference) or a class name
    (that is, a package name). See perlobj.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Auto-increment_and_Auto-decrement"><a class="permalink" href="#Auto-increment_and_Auto-decrement">Auto-increment
  and Auto-decrement</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">&quot;++&quot; and &quot;--&quot; work as in C. That is, if placed
    before a variable, they increment or decrement the variable by one before
    returning the value, and if placed after, increment or decrement after
    returning the value.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    $i = 0;  $j = 0;
    print $i++;  # prints 0
    print ++$j;  # prints 1
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Note that just as in C, Perl doesn't define <b>when</b> the
    variable is incremented or decremented. You just know it will be done
    sometime before or after the value is returned. This also means that
    modifying a variable twice in the same statement will lead to undefined
    behavior. Avoid statements like:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    $i = $i ++;
    print ++ $i + $i ++;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Perl will not guarantee what the result of the above statements
    is.</p>
<p class="Pp">The auto-increment operator has a little extra builtin magic to
    it. If you increment a variable that is numeric, or that has ever been used
    in a numeric context, you get a normal increment. If, however, the variable
    has been used in only string contexts since it was set, and has a value that
    is not the empty string and matches the pattern
    <span class="Li">&quot;/^[a-zA-Z]*[0-9]*\z/&quot;</span>, the increment is
    done as a string, preserving each character within its range, with
  carry:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    print ++($foo = &quot;99&quot;);      # prints &quot;100&quot;
    print ++($foo = &quot;a0&quot;);      # prints &quot;a1&quot;
    print ++($foo = &quot;Az&quot;);      # prints &quot;Ba&quot;
    print ++($foo = &quot;zz&quot;);      # prints &quot;aaa&quot;
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> is always treated as
    numeric, and in particular is changed to <span class="Li">0</span> before
    incrementing (so that a post-increment of an undef value will return
    <span class="Li">0</span> rather than
    <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span>).</p>
<p class="Pp">The auto-decrement operator is not magical.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Exponentiation"><a class="permalink" href="#Exponentiation">Exponentiation</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Binary &quot;**&quot; is the exponentiation operator. It binds
    even more tightly than unary minus, so -2**4 is -(2**4), not (-2)**4. (This
    is implemented using C's <i>pow</i>(3) function, which actually works on
    doubles internally.)</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Symbolic_Unary_Operators"><a class="permalink" href="#Symbolic_Unary_Operators">Symbolic
  Unary Operators</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Unary &quot;!&quot; performs logical negation, that is,
    &quot;not&quot;. See also <span class="Li">&quot;not&quot;</span> for a
    lower precedence version of this.</p>
<p class="Pp">Unary &quot;-&quot; performs arithmetic negation if the operand is
    numeric, including any string that looks like a number. If the operand is an
    identifier, a string consisting of a minus sign concatenated with the
    identifier is returned. Otherwise, if the string starts with a plus or
    minus, a string starting with the opposite sign is returned. One effect of
    these rules is that -bareword is equivalent to the string
    &quot;-bareword&quot;. If, however, the string begins with a non-alphabetic
    character (excluding &quot;+&quot; or &quot;-&quot;), Perl will attempt to
    convert the string to a numeric and the arithmetic negation is performed. If
    the string cannot be cleanly converted to a numeric, Perl will give the
    warning <b>Argument &quot;the string&quot; isn't numeric in negation (-) at
    ...</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Unary &quot;~&quot; performs bitwise negation, that is, 1's
    complement. For example, <span class="Li">&quot;0666 &amp; ~027&quot;</span>
    is 0640. (See also &quot;Integer Arithmetic&quot; and &quot;Bitwise String
    Operators&quot;.) Note that the width of the result is platform-dependent:
    ~0 is 32 bits wide on a 32-bit platform, but 64 bits wide on a 64-bit
    platform, so if you are expecting a certain bit width, remember to use the
    &quot;&amp;&quot; operator to mask off the excess bits.</p>
<p class="Pp">When complementing strings, if all characters have ordinal values
    under 256, then their complements will, also. But if they do not, all
    characters will be in either 32- or 64-bit complements, depending on your
    architecture. So for example,
    <span class="Li">&quot;~&quot;\x{3B1}&quot;&quot;</span> is
    <span class="Li">&quot;\x{FFFF_FC4E}&quot;</span> on 32-bit machines and
    <span class="Li">&quot;\x{FFFF_FFFF_FFFF_FC4E}&quot;</span> on 64-bit
    machines.</p>
<p class="Pp">Unary &quot;+&quot; has no effect whatsoever, even on strings. It
    is useful syntactically for separating a function name from a parenthesized
    expression that would otherwise be interpreted as the complete list of
    function arguments. (See examples above under Terms and List Operators
    (Leftward).)</p>
<p class="Pp">Unary &quot;\&quot; creates a reference to whatever follows it.
    See perlreftut and perlref. Do not confuse this behavior with the behavior
    of backslash within a string, although both forms do convey the notion of
    protecting the next thing from interpolation.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Binding_Operators"><a class="permalink" href="#Binding_Operators">Binding
  Operators</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Binary &quot;=~&quot; binds a scalar expression to a pattern
    match. Certain operations search or modify the string
    <span class="Li">$_</span> by default. This operator makes that kind of
    operation work on some other string. The right argument is a search pattern,
    substitution, or transliteration. The left argument is what is supposed to
    be searched, substituted, or transliterated instead of the default
    <span class="Li">$_</span>. When used in scalar context, the return value
    generally indicates the success of the operation. The exceptions are
    substitution (s///) and transliteration (y///) with the
    <span class="Li">&quot;/r&quot;</span> (non-destructive) option, which cause
    the <b>r</b>eturn value to be the result of the substitution. Behavior in
    list context depends on the particular operator. See &quot;Regexp Quote-Like
    Operators&quot; for details and perlretut for examples using these
    operators.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the right argument is an expression rather than a search
    pattern, substitution, or transliteration, it is interpreted as a search
    pattern at run time. Note that this means that its contents will be
    interpolated twice, so</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    '\\' =~ q'\\';
</pre>
<p class="Pp">is not ok, as the regex engine will end up trying to compile the
    pattern <span class="Li">&quot;\&quot;</span>, which it will consider a
    syntax error.</p>
<p class="Pp">Binary &quot;!~&quot; is just like &quot;=~&quot; except the
    return value is negated in the logical sense.</p>
<p class="Pp">Binary &quot;!~&quot; with a non-destructive substitution (s///r)
    or transliteration (y///r) is a syntax error.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Multiplicative_Operators"><a class="permalink" href="#Multiplicative_Operators">Multiplicative
  Operators</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Binary &quot;*&quot; multiplies two numbers.</p>
<p class="Pp">Binary &quot;/&quot; divides two numbers.</p>
<p class="Pp">Binary &quot;%&quot; is the modulo operator, which computes the
    division remainder of its first argument with respect to its second
    argument. Given integer operands <span class="Li">$a</span> and
    <span class="Li">$b</span>: If <span class="Li">$b</span> is positive, then
    <span class="Li">&quot;$a % $b&quot;</span> is <span class="Li">$a</span>
    minus the largest multiple of <span class="Li">$b</span> less than or equal
    to <span class="Li">$a</span>. If <span class="Li">$b</span> is negative,
    then <span class="Li">&quot;$a % $b&quot;</span> is
    <span class="Li">$a</span> minus the smallest multiple of
    <span class="Li">$b</span> that is not less than <span class="Li">$a</span>
    (that is, the result will be less than or equal to zero). If the operands
    <span class="Li">$a</span> and <span class="Li">$b</span> are floating point
    values and the absolute value of <span class="Li">$b</span> (that is
    <span class="Li">&quot;abs($b)&quot;</span>) is less than
    <span class="Li">&quot;(UV_MAX + 1)&quot;</span>, only the integer portion
    of <span class="Li">$a</span> and <span class="Li">$b</span> will be used in
    the operation (Note: here <span class="Li">&quot;UV_MAX&quot;</span> means
    the maximum of the unsigned integer type). If the absolute value of the
    right operand (<span class="Li">&quot;abs($b)&quot;</span>) is greater than
    or equal to <span class="Li">&quot;(UV_MAX + 1)&quot;</span>, &quot;%&quot;
    computes the floating-point remainder <span class="Li">$r</span> in the
    equation <span class="Li">&quot;($r = $a - $i*$b)&quot;</span> where
    <span class="Li">$i</span> is a certain integer that makes
    <span class="Li">$r</span> have the same sign as the right operand
    <span class="Li">$b</span> (<b>not</b> as the left operand
    <span class="Li">$a</span> like C function
    <span class="Li">&quot;fmod()&quot;</span>) and the absolute value less than
    that of <span class="Li">$b</span>. Note that when
    <span class="Li">&quot;use integer&quot;</span> is in scope, &quot;%&quot;
    gives you direct access to the modulo operator as implemented by your C
    compiler. This operator is not as well defined for negative operands, but it
    will execute faster.</p>
<p class="Pp">Binary &quot;x&quot; is the repetition operator. In scalar context
    or if the left operand is not enclosed in parentheses, it returns a string
    consisting of the left operand repeated the number of times specified by the
    right operand. In list context, if the left operand is enclosed in
    parentheses or is a list formed by
    <span class="Li">&quot;qw/STRING/&quot;</span>, it repeats the list. If the
    right operand is zero or negative, it returns an empty string or an empty
    list, depending on the context.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    print '-' x 80;             # print row of dashes
    print &quot;\t&quot; x ($tab/8), ' ' x ($tab%8);      # tab over
    @ones = (1) x 80;           # a list of 80 1's

    <span class="Li">&quot;use integer&quot;</span> (see &quot;Integer

    C integers are used. Either way, the implementation isn't going to generate
    results larger than the size of the integer type Perl was built with (32
    bits or 64 bits).</p>
<p class="Pp">The result of overflowing the range of the integers is undefined

<p class="Pp">Regarding precedence, the filetest operators, like
    <span class="Li">&quot;-f&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;-M&quot;</span>, etc. are treated like named unary
    operators, but they don't follow this functional parenthesis rule. That
    means, for example, that

<h2 class="Ss" id="Smartmatch_Operator"><a class="permalink" href="#Smartmatch_Operator">Smartmatch
  Operator</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">First available in Perl 5.10.1 (the 5.10.0 version behaved
    differently), binary <span class="Li">&quot;~~&quot;</span> does a
    &quot;smartmatch&quot; between its arguments. This is mostly used implicitly
    in the <span class="Li">&quot;when&quot;</span> construct described in
    perlsyn, although not all <span class="Li">&quot;when&quot;</span> clauses
    call the smartmatch operator. Unique among all of Perl's operators, the
    smartmatch operator can recurse. The smartmatch operator is experimental and
    its behavior is subject to change.</p>
<p class="Pp">It is also unique in that all other Perl operators impose a
    context (usually string or numeric context) on their operands,
    autoconverting those operands to those imposed contexts. In contrast,
    smartmatch <i>infers</i> contexts from the actual types of its operands and
    uses that type information to select a suitable comparison mechanism.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;~~&quot;</span> operator compares its
    operands &quot;polymorphically&quot;, determining how to compare them
    according to their actual types (numeric, string, array, hash, etc.) Like
    the equality operators with which it shares the same precedence,
    <span class="Li">&quot;~~&quot;</span> returns 1 for true and
    <span class="Li">&quot;&quot;</span> for false. It is often best read aloud
    as &quot;in&quot;, &quot;inside of&quot;, or &quot;is contained in&quot;,
    because the left operand is often looked for <i>inside</i> the right
    operand. That makes the order of the operands to the smartmatch operand
    often opposite that of the regular match operator. In other words, the
    &quot;smaller&quot; thing is usually placed in the left operand and the
    larger one in the right.</p>
<p class="Pp">The behavior of a smartmatch depends on what type of things its
    arguments are, as determined by the following table. The first row of the
    table whose types apply determines the smartmatch behavior. Because what
    actually happens is mostly determined by the type of the second operand, the
    table is sorted on the right operand instead of on the left.</p>

<p class="Pp">Notes:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>1. Empty hashes or arrays match.</dt>
  <dd></dd>

<p class="Pp">The smartmatch implicitly dereferences any non-blessed hash or
    array reference, so the
    <span class="Li">&quot;</span><span class="Li"><i>HASH</i></span><span class="Li">&quot;</span>
    and
    <span class="Li">&quot;</span><span class="Li"><i>ARRAY</i></span><span class="Li">&quot;</span>
    entries apply in those cases. For blessed references, the
    <span class="Li">&quot;</span><span class="Li"><i>Object</i></span><span class="Li">&quot;</span>
    entries apply. Smartmatches involving hashes only consider hash keys, never
    hash values.</p>
<p class="Pp">The &quot;like&quot; code entry is not always an exact rendition.
    For example, the smartmatch operator short-circuits whenever possible, but
    <span class="Li">&quot;grep&quot;</span> does not. Also,
    <span class="Li">&quot;grep&quot;</span> in scalar context returns the
    number of matches, but <span class="Li">&quot;~~&quot;</span> returns only
    true or false.</p>
<p class="Pp">Unlike most operators, the smartmatch operator knows to treat
    <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> specially:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    use v5.10.1;
    @array = (1, 2, 3, undef, 4, 5);
    say &quot;some elements undefined&quot; if undef ~~ @array;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Each operand is considered in a modified scalar context, the
    modification being that array and hash variables are passed by reference to
    the operator, which implicitly dereferences them. Both elements of each pair
    are the same:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    use v5.10.1;
    my %hash = (red    =&gt; 1, blue   =&gt; 2, green  =&gt; 3,
                orange =&gt; 4, yellow =&gt; 5, purple =&gt; 6,
                black  =&gt; 7, grey   =&gt; 8, white  =&gt; 9);
    my @array = qw(red blue green);
    say &quot;some array elements in hash keys&quot; if  @array ~~  %hash;
    say &quot;some array elements in hash keys&quot; if \@array ~~ \%hash;
    say &quot;red in array&quot; if &quot;red&quot; ~~  @array;
    say &quot;red in array&quot; if &quot;red&quot; ~~ \@array;
    say &quot;some keys end in e&quot; if /e$/ ~~  %hash;
    say &quot;some keys end in e&quot; if /e$/ ~~ \%hash;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Two arrays smartmatch if each element in the first array
    smartmatches (that is, is &quot;in&quot;) the corresponding element in the
    second array, recursively.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    use v5.10.1;
    my @little = qw(red blue green);
    my @bigger = (&quot;red&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;, [ &quot;orange&quot;, &quot;green&quot; ] );
    if (@little ~~ @bigger) {  # true!
        say &quot;little is contained in bigger&quot;;
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Because the smartmatch operator recurses on nested arrays, this
    will still report that &quot;red&quot; is in the array.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    use v5.10.1;
    my @array = qw(red blue green);
    my $nested_array = [[[[[[[ @array ]]]]]]];
    say &quot;red in array&quot; if &quot;red&quot; ~~ $nested_array;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If two arrays smartmatch each other, then they are deep copies of
    each others' values, as this example reports:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    use v5.12.0;
    my @a = (0, 1, 2, [3, [4, 5], 6], 7); 
    my @b = (0, 1, 2, [3, [4, 5], 6], 7); 
    if (@a ~~ @b &amp;&amp; @b ~~ @a) {
        say &quot;a and b are deep copies of each other&quot;;
    } 
    elsif (@a ~~ @b) {
        say &quot;a smartmatches in b&quot;;
    } 
    elsif (@b ~~ @a) {
        say &quot;b smartmatches in a&quot;;
    } 
    else {
        say &quot;a and b don't smartmatch each other at all&quot;;
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If you were to set <span class="Li">&quot;$b[3] = 4&quot;</span>,
    then instead of reporting that &quot;a and b are deep copies of each
    other&quot;, it now reports that &quot;b smartmatches in a&quot;. That
    because the corresponding position in <span class="Li">@a</span> contains an
    array that (eventually) has a 4 in it.</p>
<p class="Pp">Smartmatching one hash against another reports whether both
    contain the same keys, no more and no less. This could be used to see
    whether two records have the same field names, without caring what values
    those fields might have. For example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    use v5.10.1;
    sub make_dogtag {
        state $REQUIRED_FIELDS = { name=&gt;1, rank=&gt;1, serial_num=&gt;1 };
        my ($class, $init_fields) = @_;
        die &quot;Must supply (only) name, rank, and serial number&quot;
            unless $init_fields ~~ $REQUIRED_FIELDS;
        ...
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">or, if other non-required fields are allowed, use ARRAY ~~
  HASH:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    use v5.10.1;
    sub make_dogtag {
        state $REQUIRED_FIELDS = { name=&gt;1, rank=&gt;1, serial_num=&gt;1 };
        my ($class, $init_fields) = @_;
        die &quot;Must supply (at least) name, rank, and serial number&quot;
            unless [keys %{$init_fields}] ~~ $REQUIRED_FIELDS;
        ...
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The smartmatch operator is most often used as the implicit
    operator of a <span class="Li">&quot;when&quot;</span> clause. See the
    section on &quot;Switch Statements&quot; in perlsyn.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Smartmatching of Objects</i></p>
<p class="Pp">To avoid relying on an object's underlying representation, if the
    smartmatch's right operand is an object that doesn't overload
    <span class="Li">&quot;~~&quot;</span>, it raises the exception
    &quot;<span class="Li">&quot;Smartmatching a non-overloaded object</span>
    <span class="Li">breaks encapsulation&quot;</span>&quot;. That's because one
    has no business digging around to see whether something is &quot;in&quot; an
    object. These are all illegal on objects without a
    <span class="Li">&quot;~~&quot;</span> overload:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    %hash ~~ $object
       42 ~~ $object
   &quot;fred&quot; ~~ $object
</pre>
<p class="Pp">However, you can change the way an object is smartmatched by
    overloading the <span class="Li">&quot;~~&quot;</span> operator. This is
    allowed to extend the usual smartmatch semantics. For objects that do have
    an <span class="Li">&quot;~~&quot;</span> overload, see overload.</p>
<p class="Pp">Using an object as the left operand is allowed, although not very
    useful. Smartmatching rules take precedence over overloading, so even if the
    object in the left operand has smartmatch overloading, this will be ignored.
    A left operand that is a non-overloaded object falls back on a string or
    numeric comparison of whatever the <span class="Li">&quot;ref&quot;</span>
    operator returns. That means that</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    $object ~~ X
</pre>
<p class="Pp">does <i>not</i> invoke the overload method with
    <span class="Li">&quot;</span><span class="Li"><i>X</i></span><span class="Li">&quot;</span>
    as an argument. Instead the above table is consulted as normal, and based on
    the type of
    <span class="Li">&quot;</span><span class="Li"><i>X</i></span><span class="Li">&quot;</span>,
    overloading may or may not be invoked. For simple strings or numbers, in
    becomes equivalent to this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    $object ~~ $number          ref($object) == $number
    $object ~~ $string          ref($object) eq $string
</pre>
<p class="Pp">For example, this reports that the handle smells IOish (but please
    don't really do this!):</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    use IO::Handle;
    my $fh = IO::Handle-&gt;new();
    if ($fh ~~ /\bIO\b/) {
        say &quot;handle smells IOish&quot;;
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">That's because it treats <span class="Li">$fh</span> as a string
    like <span class="Li">&quot;IO::Handle=GLOB(0x8039e0)&quot;</span>, then
    pattern matches against that.</p>

    or. In fact, it's exactly the same as
    <span class="Li">&quot;||&quot;</span>, except that it tests the left hand
    side's definedness instead of its truth. Thus, <span class="Li">&quot;EXPR1
    // EXPR2&quot;</span> returns the value of
    <span class="Li">&quot;EXPR1&quot;</span> if it's defined, otherwise, the
    value of <span class="Li">&quot;EXPR2&quot;</span> is returned.
    (<span class="Li">&quot;EXPR1&quot;</span> is evaluated in scalar context,
    <span class="Li">&quot;EXPR2&quot;</span> in the context of
    <span class="Li">&quot;//&quot;</span> itself). Usually, this is the same
    result as <span class="Li">&quot;defined(EXPR1) ? EXPR1 : EXPR2&quot;</span>
    (except that the ternary-operator form can be used as a lvalue, while
    <span class="Li">&quot;EXPR1 // EXPR2&quot;</span> cannot). This is very
    useful for providing default values for variables. If you actually want to
    test if at least one of <span class="Li">$a</span> and
    <span class="Li">$b</span> is defined, use <span class="Li">&quot;defined($a
    // $b)&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;||&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;//&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;&amp;&amp;&quot;</span> operators return the last
    value evaluated (unlike C's <span class="Li">&quot;||&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;&amp;&amp;&quot;</span>, which return 0 or 1). Thus,
    a reasonably portable way to find out the home directory might be:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    $home =  $ENV{HOME}
          // $ENV{LOGDIR}
          // (getpwuid($&lt;))[7]
          // die &quot;You're homeless!\n&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">In particular, this means that you shouldn't use this for
    selecting between two aggregates for assignment:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    @a = @b || @c;              # this is wrong
    @a = scalar(@b) || @c;      # really meant this
    @a = @b ? @b : @c;          # this works fine, though
</pre>
<p class="Pp">As alternatives to <span class="Li">&quot;&amp;&amp;&quot;</span>
    and <span class="Li">&quot;||&quot;</span> when used for control flow, Perl
    provides the <span class="Li">&quot;and&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;or&quot;</span> operators (see below). The
    short-circuit behavior is identical. The precedence of &quot;and&quot; and
    &quot;or&quot; is much lower, however, so that you can safely use them after
    a list operator without the need for parentheses:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    unlink &quot;alpha&quot;, &quot;beta&quot;, &quot;gamma&quot;
            or gripe(), next LINE;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">With the C-style operators that would have been written like
  this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    unlink(&quot;alpha&quot;, &quot;beta&quot;, &quot;gamma&quot;)
            || (gripe(), next LINE);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">It would be even more readable to write that this way:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    unless(unlink(&quot;alpha&quot;, &quot;beta&quot;, &quot;gamma&quot;)) {
        gripe();
        next LINE;
    }
</pre>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Range_Operators"><a class="permalink" href="#Range_Operators">Range
  Operators</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Binary &quot;..&quot; is the range operator, which is really two
    different operators depending on the context. In list context, it returns a
    list of values counting (up by ones) from the left value to the right value.
    If the left value is greater than the right value then it returns the empty
    list. The range operator is useful for writing
    <span class="Li">&quot;foreach (1..10)&quot;</span> loops and for doing
    slice operations on arrays. In the current implementation, no temporary
    array is created when the range operator is used as the expression in
    <span class="Li">&quot;foreach&quot;</span> loops, but older versions of
    Perl might burn a lot of memory when you write something like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    for (1 .. 1_000_000) {
        # code
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The range operator also works on strings, using the magical
    auto-increment, see below.</p>
<p class="Pp">In scalar context, &quot;..&quot; returns a boolean value. The
    operator is bistable, like a flip-flop, and emulates the line-range (comma)
    operator of <b>sed</b>, <b>awk</b>, and various editors. Each &quot;..&quot;
    operator maintains its own boolean state, even across calls to a subroutine
    that contains it. It is false as long as its left operand is false. Once the
    left operand is true, the range operator stays true until the right operand
    is true, <i>AFTER</i> which the range operator becomes false again. It
    doesn't become false till the next time the range operator is evaluated. It
    can test the right operand and become false on the same evaluation it became
    true (as in <b>awk</b>), but it still returns true once. If you don't want
    it to test the right operand until the next evaluation, as in <b>sed</b>,
    just use three dots (&quot;...&quot;) instead of two. In all other regards,
    &quot;...&quot; behaves just like &quot;..&quot; does.</p>
<p class="Pp">The right operand is not evaluated while the operator is in the
    &quot;false&quot; state, and the left operand is not evaluated while the
    operator is in the &quot;true&quot; state. The precedence is a little lower
    than || and &amp;&amp;. The value returned is either the empty string for
    false, or a sequence number (beginning with 1) for true. The sequence number
    is reset for each range encountered. The final sequence number in a range
    has the string &quot;E0&quot; appended to it, which doesn't affect its
    numeric value, but gives you something to search for if you want to exclude
    the endpoint. You can exclude the beginning point by waiting for the
    sequence number to be greater than 1.</p>
<p class="Pp">If either operand of scalar &quot;..&quot; is a constant
    expression, that operand is considered true if it is equal
    (<span class="Li">&quot;==&quot;</span>) to the current input line number
    (the <span class="Li">$.</span> variable).</p>
<p class="Pp">To be pedantic, the comparison is actually
    <span class="Li">&quot;int(EXPR) == int(EXPR)&quot;</span>, but that is only
    an issue if you use a floating point expression; when implicitly using
    <span class="Li">$.</span> as described in the previous paragraph, the
    comparison is <span class="Li">&quot;int(EXPR) == int($.)&quot;</span> which
    is only an issue when <span class="Li">$.</span> is set to a floating point
    value and you are not reading from a file. Furthermore,
    <span class="Li">&quot;span&quot; .. &quot;spat&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;2.18 .. 3.14&quot;</span> will not do what you want
    in scalar context because each of the operands are evaluated using their
    integer representation.</p>
<p class="Pp">Examples:</p>
<p class="Pp">As a scalar operator:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    if (101 .. 200) { print; } # print 2nd hundred lines, short for
                               #  if ($. == 101 .. $. == 200) { print; }
    next LINE if (1 .. /^$/);  # skip header lines, short for
                               #   next LINE if ($. == 1 .. /^$/);
                               # (typically in a loop labeled LINE)
    s/^/&gt; / if (/^$/ .. eof());  # quote body
    # parse mail messages
    while (&lt;&gt;) {
        $in_header =   1  .. /^$/;
        $in_body   = /^$/ .. eof;
        if ($in_header) {
            # do something
        } else { # in body
            # do something else
        }
    } continue {
        close ARGV if eof;             # reset $. each file
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Here's a simple example to illustrate the difference between the
    two range operators:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    @lines = (&quot;   - Foo&quot;,
              &quot;01 - Bar&quot;,
              &quot;1  - Baz&quot;,
              &quot;   - Quux&quot;);
    foreach (@lines) {
        if (/0/ .. /1/) {
            print &quot;$_\n&quot;;
        }
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This program will print only the line containing &quot;Bar&quot;.
    If the range operator is changed to <span class="Li">&quot;...&quot;</span>,
    it will also print the &quot;Baz&quot; line.</p>
<p class="Pp">And now some examples as a list operator:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    for (101 .. 200) { print }      # print $_ 100 times
    @foo = @foo[0 .. $#foo];        # an expensive no-op
    @foo = @foo[$#foo-4 .. $#foo];  # slice last 5 items
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The range operator (in list context) makes use of the magical
    auto-increment algorithm if the operands are strings. You can say</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    @alphabet = (&quot;A&quot; .. &quot;Z&quot;);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">to get all normal letters of the English alphabet, or</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    $hexdigit = (0 .. 9, &quot;a&quot; .. &quot;f&quot;)[$num &amp; 15];
</pre>
<p class="Pp">to get a hexadecimal digit, or</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    @z2 = (&quot;01&quot; .. &quot;31&quot;);
    print $z2[$mday];
</pre>
<p class="Pp">to get dates with leading zeros.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the final value specified is not in the sequence that the
    magical increment would produce, the sequence goes until the next value
    would be longer than the final value specified.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the initial value specified isn't part of a magical increment
    sequence (that is, a non-empty string matching
    <span class="Li">&quot;/^[a-zA-Z]*[0-9]*\z/&quot;</span>), only the initial
    value will be returned. So the following will only return an alpha:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    use charnames &quot;greek&quot;;
    my @greek_small =  (&quot;\N{alpha}&quot; .. &quot;\N{omega}&quot;);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">To get the 25 traditional lowercase Greek letters, including both
    sigmas, you could use this instead:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    use charnames &quot;greek&quot;;
    my @greek_small =  map { chr } ( ord(&quot;\N{alpha}&quot;) 
                                        ..
                                     ord(&quot;\N{omega}&quot;) 
                                   );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">However, because there are <i>many</i> other lowercase Greek
    characters than just those, to match lowercase Greek characters in a regular
    expression, you would use the pattern
    <span class="Li">&quot;/(?:(?=\p{Greek})\p{Lower})+/&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Because each operand is evaluated in integer form,
    <span class="Li">&quot;2.18 .. 3.14&quot;</span> will return two elements in
    list context.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    @list = (2.18 .. 3.14); # same as @list = (2 .. 3);
</pre>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Conditional_Operator"><a class="permalink" href="#Conditional_Operator">Conditional
  Operator</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Ternary &quot;?:&quot; is the conditional operator, just as in C.
    It works much like an if-then-else. If the argument before the ? is true,
    the argument before the : is returned, otherwise the argument after the : is
    returned. For example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    printf &quot;I have %d dog%s.\n&quot;, $n,
            ($n == 1) ? &quot;&quot; : &quot;s&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Scalar or list context propagates downward into the 2nd or 3rd
    argument, whichever is selected.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    $a = $ok ? $b : $c;  # get a scalar
    @a = $ok ? @b : @c;  # get an array
    $a = $ok ? @b : @c;  # oops, that's just a count!
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The operator may be assigned to if both the 2nd and 3rd arguments
    are legal lvalues (meaning that you can assign to them):</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    ($a_or_b ? $a : $b) = $c;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Because this operator produces an assignable result, using
    assignments without parentheses will get you in trouble. For example,
  this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    $a % 2 ? $a += 10 : $a += 2
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Really means this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    (($a % 2) ? ($a += 10) : $a) += 2
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Rather than this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    ($a % 2) ? ($a += 10) : ($a += 2)
</pre>
<p class="Pp">That should probably be written more simply as:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    $a += ($a % 2) ? 10 : 2;
</pre>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Assignment_Operators"><a class="permalink" href="#Assignment_Operators">Assignment
  Operators</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">&quot;=&quot; is the ordinary assignment operator.</p>
<p class="Pp">Assignment operators work as in C. That is,</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    $a += 2;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">is equivalent to</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    $a = $a + 2;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">although without duplicating any side effects that dereferencing
    the lvalue might trigger, such as from <i>tie()</i>. Other assignment
    operators work similarly. The following are recognized:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    **=    +=    *=    &amp;=    &lt;&lt;=    &amp;&amp;=
           -=    /=    |=    &gt;&gt;=    ||=
           .=    %=    ^=           //=
                 x=
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Although these are grouped by family, they all have the precedence
    of assignment.</p>
<p class="Pp">Unlike in C, the scalar assignment operator produces a valid
    lvalue. Modifying an assignment is equivalent to doing the assignment and
    then modifying the variable that was assigned to. This is useful for
    modifying a copy of something, like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    ($tmp = $global) =~ tr/13579/24680/;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Although as of 5.14, that can be also be accomplished this
  way:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    use v5.14;
    $tmp = ($global =~  tr/13579/24680/r);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Likewise,</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    ($a += 2) *= 3;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">is equivalent to</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    $a += 2;
    $a *= 3;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Similarly, a list assignment in list context produces the list of
    lvalues assigned to, and a list assignment in scalar context returns the
    number of elements produced by the expression on the right hand side of the
    assignment.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Comma_Operator"><a class="permalink" href="#Comma_Operator">Comma
  Operator</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Binary &quot;,&quot; is the comma operator. In scalar context it
    evaluates its left argument, throws that value away, then evaluates its
    right argument and returns that value. This is just like C's comma
  operator.</p>
<p class="Pp">In list context, it's just the list argument separator, and
    inserts both its arguments into the list. These arguments are also evaluated
    from left to right.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;=&gt;&quot;</span> operator is a
    synonym for the comma except that it causes a word on its left to be
    interpreted as a string if it begins with a letter or underscore and is
    composed only of letters, digits and underscores. This includes operands
    that might otherwise be interpreted as operators, constants, single number
    v-strings or function calls. If in doubt about this behavior, the left
    operand can be quoted explicitly.</p>
<p class="Pp">Otherwise, the <span class="Li">&quot;=&gt;&quot;</span> operator
    behaves exactly as the comma operator or list argument separator, according
    to context.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    use constant FOO =&gt; &quot;something&quot;;
    my %h = ( FOO =&gt; 23 );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">is equivalent to:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    my %h = (&quot;FOO&quot;, 23);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">It is <i>NOT</i>:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    my %h = (&quot;something&quot;, 23);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;=&gt;&quot;</span> operator is helpful
    in documenting the correspondence between keys and values in hashes, and
    other paired elements in lists.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    %hash = ( $key =&gt; $value );
    login( $username =&gt; $password );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The special quoting behavior ignores precedence, and hence may
    apply to <i>part</i> of the left operand:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    print time.shift =&gt; &quot;bbb&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">That example prints something like &quot;1314363215shiftbbb&quot;,
    because the <span class="Li">&quot;=&gt;&quot;</span> implicitly quotes the
    <span class="Li">&quot;shift&quot;</span> immediately on its left, ignoring
    the fact that <span class="Li">&quot;time.shift&quot;</span> is the entire
    left operand.</p>

  Operators (Rightward)</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">On the right side of a list operator, the comma has very low
    precedence, such that it controls all comma-separated expressions found
    there. The only operators with lower precedence are the logical operators
    &quot;and&quot;, &quot;or&quot;, and &quot;not&quot;, which may be used to
    evaluate calls to list operators without the need for parentheses:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    open HANDLE, &quot;&lt; :utf8&quot;, &quot;filename&quot; or die &quot;Can't open: $!\n&quot;;

<pre>    open(HANDLE, &quot;&lt; :utf8&quot;, &quot;filename&quot;) or die &quot;Can't open: $!\n&quot;;

<p class="Pp">Binary &quot;or&quot; returns the logical disjunction of the two
    surrounding expressions. It's equivalent to
    <span class="Li">&quot;||&quot;</span> except for the very low precedence.
    This makes it useful for control flow:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    print FH $data              or die &quot;Can't write to FH: $!&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This means that it short-circuits: the right expression is
    evaluated only if the left expression is false. Due to its precedence, you
    must be careful to avoid using it as replacement for the
    <span class="Li">&quot;||&quot;</span> operator. It usually works out better
    for flow control than in assignments:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    $a = $b or $c;              # bug: this is wrong
    ($a = $b) or $c;            # really means this
    $a = $b || $c;              # better written this way
</pre>
<p class="Pp">However, when it's a list-context assignment and you're trying to
    use <span class="Li">&quot;||&quot;</span> for control flow, you probably
    need &quot;or&quot; so that the assignment takes higher precedence.</p>

<pre>    @info = stat($file) || die;     # oops, scalar sense of stat!

<p class="Pp">Then again, you could always use parentheses.</p>
<p class="Pp">Binary <span class="Li">&quot;xor&quot;</span> returns the

    matching capabilities. Perl provides customary quote characters for these
    behaviors, but also provides a way for you to choose your quote character
    for any of them. In the following table, a
    <span class="Li">&quot;{}&quot;</span> represents any pair of delimiters you
    choose.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    Customary  Generic        Meaning        Interpolates
        ''       q{}          Literal             no
        &quot;&quot;      qq{}          Literal             yes
        ``      qx{}          Command             yes*
                qw{}         Word list            no
        //       m{}       Pattern match          yes*
                qr{}          Pattern             yes*
                 s{}{}      Substitution          yes*

                 y{}{}    Transliteration         no (but see below)
        &lt;&lt;EOF                 here-doc            yes*
        * unless the delimiter is ''.
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Non-bracketing delimiters use the same character fore and aft, but
    the four sorts of ASCII brackets (round, angle, square, curly) all nest,
    which means that</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    q{foo{bar}baz}
</pre>
<p class="Pp">is the same as</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    'foo{bar}baz'
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Note, however, that this does not always work for quoting Perl
    code:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    $s = q{ if($a eq &quot;}&quot;) ... }; # WRONG
</pre>
<p class="Pp">is a syntax error. The
    <span class="Li">&quot;Text::Balanced&quot;</span> module (standard as of
    v5.8, and from CPAN before then) is able to do this properly.</p>
<p class="Pp">There can be whitespace between the operator and the quoting
    characters, except when <span class="Li">&quot;#&quot;</span> is being used
    as the quoting character. <span class="Li">&quot;q#foo#&quot;</span> is
    parsed as the string <span class="Li">&quot;foo&quot;</span>, while
    <span class="Li">&quot;q #foo#&quot;</span> is the operator
    <span class="Li">&quot;q&quot;</span> followed by a comment. Its argument
    will be taken from the next line. This allows you to write:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    s {foo}  # Replace foo
      {bar}  # with bar.
</pre>

    <p class="Pp">Only hexadecimal digits are valid following

        <span class="Li">&quot;\x&quot;</span> is followed by fewer than two

    <p class="Pp">In other words, it's the character whose code point has had 64
        xor'd with its uppercase. <span class="Li">&quot;\c?&quot;</span> is
        DELETE because <span class="Li">&quot;ord(&quot;?&quot;) ^
        64&quot;</span> is 127, and <span class="Li">&quot;\c@&quot;</span> is
        NULL because the ord of &quot;@&quot; is 64, so xor'ing 64 itself
        produces 0.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Also,
        <span class="Li">&quot;\c\</span><span class="Li"><i>X</i></span><span class="Li">&quot;</span>

    <p class="Pp">On ASCII platforms, the resulting characters from the list
        above are the complete set of ASCII controls. This isn't the case on
        EBCDIC platforms; see &quot;OPERATOR DIFFERENCES&quot; in perlebcdic for

        platforms.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Use of any other character following the &quot;c&quot; besides
        those listed above is discouraged, and some are deprecated with the
        intention of removing those in a later Perl version. What happens for
        any of these other characters currently though, is that the value is
        derived by xor'ing with the seventh bit, which is 64.</p>
    <p class="Pp">To get platform independent controls, you can use
        <span class="Li">&quot;\N{...}&quot;</span>.</p>

  <dd>The result is the character specified by the octal number between the
      braces. See &quot;[8]&quot; below for details on which character.
    <p class="Pp">If a character that isn't an octal digit is encountered, a
        warning is raised, and the value is based on the octal digits before it,
        discarding it and all following characters up to the closing brace. It
        is a fatal error if there are no octal digits at all.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>[7]</dt>
  <dd>The result is the character specified by the three-digit octal number in
      the range 000 to 777 (but best to not use above 077, see next paragraph).
      See &quot;[8]&quot; below for details on which character.
    <p class="Pp">Some contexts allow 2 or even 1 digit, but any usage without
        exactly three digits, the first being a zero, may give unintended
        results. (For example, in a regular expression it may be confused with a
        backreference; see &quot;Octal escapes&quot; in perlrebackslash.)
        Starting in Perl 5.14, you may use
        <span class="Li">&quot;\o{}&quot;</span> instead, which avoids all these
        problems. Otherwise, it is best to use this construct only for ordinals
        <span class="Li">&quot;\077&quot;</span> and below, remembering to pad
        to the left with zeros to make three digits. For larger ordinals, either
        use <span class="Li">&quot;\o{}&quot;</span>, or convert to something
        else, such as to hex and use <span class="Li">&quot;\x{}&quot;</span>
        instead.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Having fewer than 3 digits may lead to a misleading warning
        message that says that what follows is ignored. For example,
        <span class="Li">&quot;\128&quot;</span> in the ASCII character set is
        equivalent to the two characters
        <span class="Li">&quot;\n8&quot;</span>, but the warning
        <span class="Li">&quot;Illegal octal</span> <span class="Li">digit '8'
        ignored&quot;</span> will be thrown. If
        <span class="Li">&quot;\n8&quot;</span> is what you want, you can avoid
        this warning by padding your octal number with
        <span class="Li">0</span>'s:
      <span class="Li">&quot;\0128&quot;</span>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>[8]</dt>
  <dd>Several constructs above specify a character by a number. That number
      gives the character's position in the character set encoding (indexed from
      0). This is called synonymously its ordinal, code position, or code point.
      Perl works on platforms that have a native encoding currently of either
      ASCII/Latin1 or EBCDIC, each of which allow specification of 256
      characters. In general, if the number is 255 (0xFF, 0377) or below, Perl
      interprets this in the platform's native encoding. If the number is 256
      (0x100, 0400) or above, Perl interprets it as a Unicode code point and the
      result is the corresponding Unicode character. For example
      <span class="Li">&quot;\x{50}&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;\o{120}&quot;</span> both are the number 80 in
      decimal, which is less than 256, so the number is interpreted in the
      native character set encoding. In ASCII the character in the 80th position
      (indexed from 0) is the letter &quot;P&quot;, and in EBCDIC it is the
      ampersand symbol &quot;&amp;&quot;.
      <span class="Li">&quot;\x{100}&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;\o{400}&quot;</span> are both 256 in decimal, so
      the number is interpreted as a Unicode code point no matter what the
      native encoding is. The name of the character in the 256th position
      (indexed by 0) in Unicode is <span class="Li">&quot;LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A
      WITH MACRON&quot;</span>.
    <p class="Pp">There are a couple of exceptions to the above rule.
        <span class="Li">&quot;\N{U+</span><span class="Li"><i>hex&#x00A0;number</i></span><span class="Li">}&quot;</span>
        is always interpreted as a Unicode code point, so that
        <span class="Li">&quot;\N{U+0050}&quot;</span> is &quot;P&quot; even on
        EBCDIC platforms. And if
        <span class="Li">&quot;use&#x00A0;encoding&quot;</span> is in effect,
        the number is considered to be in that encoding, and is translated from
        that into the platform's native encoding if there is a corresponding
        native character; otherwise to Unicode.</p>

<p class="Pp"><b>NOTE</b>: Unlike C and other languages, Perl has no
    <span class="Li">&quot;\v&quot;</span> escape sequence for the vertical tab
    (VT, which is 11 in both ASCII and EBCDIC), but you may use
    <span class="Li">&quot;\ck&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;\x0b&quot;</span>.
    (<span class="Li">&quot;\v&quot;</span> does have meaning in regular

<p class="Pp">The following escape sequences are available in constructs that
    interpolate, but not in transliterations.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    \l          lowercase next character only
    \u          titlecase (not uppercase!) next character only
    \L          lowercase all characters till \E or end of string
    \U          uppercase all characters till \E or end of string
    \F          foldcase all characters till \E or end of string
    \Q          quote (disable) pattern metacharacters till \E or
                end of string
    \E          end either case modification or quoted section
                (whichever was last seen)
</pre>
<p class="Pp">See &quot;quotemeta&quot; in perlfunc for the exact definition of
    characters that are quoted by <span class="Li">&quot;\Q&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;\L&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;\U&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;\F&quot;</span>, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;\Q&quot;</span> can stack, in which case you need one
    <span class="Li">&quot;\E&quot;</span> for each. For example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre> say&quot;This \Qquoting \ubusiness \Uhere isn't quite\E done yet,\E is it?&quot;;
 This quoting\ Business\ HERE\ ISN\'T\ QUITE\ done\ yet\, is it?
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If <span class="Li">&quot;use locale&quot;</span> is in effect
    (but not <span class="Li">&quot;use locale ':not_characters'&quot;</span>),
    the case map used by <span class="Li">&quot;\l&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;\L&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;\u&quot;</span>, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;\U&quot;</span> is taken from the current locale. See
    perllocale. If Unicode (for example,
    <span class="Li">&quot;\N{}&quot;</span> or code points of 0x100 or beyond)
    is being used, the case map used by <span class="Li">&quot;\l&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;\L&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;\u&quot;</span>, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;\U&quot;</span> is as defined by Unicode. That means
    that case-mapping a single character can sometimes produce several
    characters. Under <span class="Li">&quot;use locale&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;\F&quot;</span> produces the same results as
    <span class="Li">&quot;\L&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">All systems use the virtual <span class="Li">&quot;\n&quot;</span>
    to represent a line terminator, called a &quot;newline&quot;. There is no
    such thing as an unvarying, physical newline character. It is only an
    illusion that the operating system, device drivers, C libraries, and Perl
    all conspire to preserve. Not all systems read
    <span class="Li">&quot;\r&quot;</span> as ASCII CR and
    <span class="Li">&quot;\n&quot;</span> as ASCII LF. For example, on the
    ancient Macs (pre-MacOS X) of yesteryear, these used to be reversed, and on
    systems without line terminator, printing
    <span class="Li">&quot;\n&quot;</span> might emit no actual data. In
    general, use <span class="Li">&quot;\n&quot;</span> when you mean a
    &quot;newline&quot; for your system, but use the literal ASCII when you need
    an exact character. For example, most networking protocols expect and prefer
    a CR+LF (<span class="Li">&quot;\015\012&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;\cM\cJ&quot;</span>) for line terminators, and
    although they often accept just <span class="Li">&quot;\012&quot;</span>,
    they seldom tolerate just <span class="Li">&quot;\015&quot;</span>. If you
    get in the habit of using <span class="Li">&quot;\n&quot;</span> for
    networking, you may be burned some day.</p>
<p class="Pp">For constructs that do interpolate, variables beginning with
    &quot;<span class="Li">&quot;$&quot;</span>&quot; or
    &quot;<span class="Li">&quot;@&quot;</span>&quot; are interpolated.
    Subscripted variables such as <span class="Li">$a[3]</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;$href-&gt;{key}[0]&quot;</span> are also
    interpolated, as are array and hash slices. But method calls such as
    <span class="Li">&quot;$obj-&gt;meth&quot;</span> are not.</p>
<p class="Pp">Interpolating an array or slice interpolates the elements in
    order, separated by the value of <span class="Li">$&quot;</span>, so is
    equivalent to interpolating <span class="Li">&quot;join $&quot;,
    @array&quot;</span>. &quot;Punctuation&quot; arrays such as
    <span class="Li">&quot;@*&quot;</span> are usually interpolated only if the
    name is enclosed in braces <span class="Li">&quot;@{*}&quot;</span>, but the
    arrays <span class="Li">@_</span>, <span class="Li">&quot;@+&quot;</span>,
    and <span class="Li">&quot;@-&quot;</span> are interpolated even without
    braces.</p>
<p class="Pp">For double-quoted strings, the quoting from
    <span class="Li">&quot;\Q&quot;</span> is applied after interpolation and
    escapes are processed.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    &quot;abc\Qfoo\tbar$s\Exyz&quot;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">is equivalent to</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    &quot;abc&quot; . quotemeta(&quot;foo\tbar$s&quot;) . &quot;xyz&quot;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">For the pattern of regex operators
    (<span class="Li">&quot;qr//&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;m//&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;s///&quot;</span>), the quoting from
    <span class="Li">&quot;\Q&quot;</span> is applied after interpolation is
    processed, but before escapes are processed. This allows the pattern to
    match literally (except for <span class="Li">&quot;$&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;@&quot;</span>). For example, the following
  matches:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    '\s\t' =~ /\Q\s\t/
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Because <span class="Li">&quot;$&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;@&quot;</span> trigger interpolation, you'll need to
    use something like <span class="Li">&quot;/\Quser\E\@\Qhost/&quot;</span> to
    match them literally.</p>
<p class="Pp">Patterns are subject to an additional level of interpretation as a
    regular expression. This is done as a second pass, after variables are
    interpolated, so that regular expressions may be incorporated into the
    pattern from the variables. If this is not what you want, use
    <span class="Li">&quot;\Q&quot;</span> to interpolate a variable
  literally.</p>
<p class="Pp">Apart from the behavior described above, Perl does not expand
    multiple levels of interpolation. In particular, contrary to the
    expectations of shell programmers, back-quotes do <i>NOT</i> interpolate
    within double quotes, nor do single quotes impede evaluation of variables
    when used within double quotes.</p>

  <dd>This operator quotes (and possibly compiles) its <i>STRING</i> as a

      <i>PATTERN</i> in <span class="Li">&quot;m/PATTERN/&quot;</span>. If
      &quot;'&quot; is used as the delimiter, no interpolation is done. Returns
      a Perl value which may be used instead of the corresponding
      <span class="Li">&quot;/STRING/msixpodual&quot;</span> expression. The
      returned value is a normalized version of the original pattern. It
      magically differs from a string containing the same characters:
      <span class="Li">&quot;ref(qr/x/)&quot;</span> returns &quot;Regexp&quot;;
      however, dereferencing it is not well defined (you currently get the

    <p class="Pp">Since Perl may compile the pattern at the moment of execution
        of the <i>qr()</i> operator, using <i>qr()</i> may have speed advantages
        in some situations, notably if the result of <i>qr()</i> is used
        standalone:</p>

            }
            $success;
        } @_;
    }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Precompilation of the pattern into an internal representation
        at the moment of <i>qr()</i> avoids a need to recompile the pattern
        every time a match <span class="Li">&quot;/$pat/&quot;</span> is
        attempted. (Perl has many other internal optimizations, but none would
        be triggered in the above example if we did not use <i>qr()</i>
        operator.)</p>
    <p class="Pp">Options (specified by the following modifiers) are:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    m   Treat string as multiple lines.
    s   Treat string as single line. (Make . match a newline)
    i   Do case-insensitive pattern matching.
    x   Use extended regular expressions.
    p   When matching preserve a copy of the matched string so
        that ${^PREMATCH}, ${^MATCH}, ${^POSTMATCH} will be
        defined.
    o   Compile pattern only once.
    a   ASCII-restrict: Use ASCII for \d, \s, \w; specifying two
        a's further restricts /i matching so that no ASCII
        character will match a non-ASCII one.
    l   Use the locale.
    u   Use Unicode rules.
    d   Use Unicode or native charset, as in 5.12 and earlier.
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If a precompiled pattern is embedded in a larger pattern then
        the effect of &quot;msixpluad&quot; will be propagated appropriately.
        The effect the &quot;o&quot; modifier has is not propagated, being
        restricted to those patterns explicitly using it.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The last four modifiers listed above, added in Perl 5.14,
        control the character set semantics, but
        <span class="Li">&quot;/a&quot;</span> is the only one you are likely to
        want to specify explicitly; the other three are selected automatically
        by various pragmas.</p>
    <p class="Pp">See perlre for additional information on valid syntax for
        STRING, and for a detailed look at the semantics of regular expressions.
        In particular, all modifiers except the largely obsolete
        <span class="Li">&quot;/o&quot;</span> are further explained in
        &quot;Modifiers&quot; in perlre. <span class="Li">&quot;/o&quot;</span>

  <dt>/PATTERN/msixpodualgc</dt>
  <dd>Searches a string for a pattern match, and in scalar context returns true
      if it succeeds, false if it fails. If no string is specified via the
      <span class="Li">&quot;=~&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;!~&quot;</span> operator, the
      <span class="Li">$_</span> string is searched. (The string specified with
      <span class="Li">&quot;=~&quot;</span> need not be an lvalue--it may be
      the result of an expression evaluation, but remember the
      <span class="Li">&quot;=~&quot;</span> binds rather tightly.) See also
      perlre.
    <p class="Pp">Options are as described in
        <span class="Li">&quot;qr//&quot;</span> above; in addition, the
        following match process modifiers are available:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre> g  Match globally, i.e., find all occurrences.
 c  Do not reset search position on a failed match when /g is
    in effect.
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If &quot;/&quot; is the delimiter then the initial
        <span class="Li">&quot;m&quot;</span> is optional. With the
        <span class="Li">&quot;m&quot;</span> you can use any pair of
        non-whitespace (ASCII) characters as delimiters. This is particularly
        useful for matching path names that contain &quot;/&quot;, to avoid LTS
        (leaning toothpick syndrome). If &quot;?&quot; is the delimiter, then a
        match-only-once rule applies, described in
        <span class="Li">&quot;m?PATTERN?&quot;</span> below. If &quot;'&quot;
        is the delimiter, no interpolation is performed on the PATTERN. When
        using a character valid in an identifier, whitespace is required after
        the <span class="Li">&quot;m&quot;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">PATTERN may contain variables, which will be interpolated
        every time the pattern search is evaluated, except for when the
        delimiter is a single quote. (Note that <span class="Li">$(</span>,
        <span class="Li">$)</span>, and <span class="Li">$|</span> are not
        interpolated because they look like end-of-string tests.) Perl will not
        recompile the pattern unless an interpolated variable that it contains
        changes. You can force Perl to skip the test and never recompile by
        adding a <span class="Li">&quot;/o&quot;</span> (which stands for
        &quot;once&quot;) after the trailing delimiter. Once upon a time, Perl
        would recompile regular expressions unnecessarily, and this modifier was
        useful to tell it not to do so, in the interests of speed. But now, the
        only reasons to use <span class="Li">&quot;/o&quot;</span> are
      either:</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>1.</dt>
  <dd>The variables are thousands of characters long and you know that they
      don't change, and you need to wring out the last little bit of speed by
      having Perl skip testing for that. (There is a maintenance penalty for
      doing this, as mentioning <span class="Li">&quot;/o&quot;</span>
      constitutes a promise that you won't change the variables in the pattern.
      If you do change them, Perl won't even notice.)</dd>
  <dt>2.</dt>
  <dd>you want the pattern to use the initial values of the variables regardless
      of whether they change or not. (But there are saner ways of accomplishing
      this than using <span class="Li">&quot;/o&quot;</span>.)</dd>
  <dt>3.</dt>
  <dd>If the pattern contains embedded code, such as
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    use re 'eval';
    $code = 'foo(?{ $x })';
    /$code/
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">then perl will recompile each time, even though the pattern
        string hasn't changed, to ensure that the current value of
        <span class="Li">$x</span> is seen each time. Use
        <span class="Li">&quot;/o&quot;</span> if you want to avoid this.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="Bd-indent">

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="The"><a class="permalink" href="#The">The empty pattern //</a></dt>
  <dd>If the PATTERN evaluates to the empty string, the last <i>successfully</i>
      matched regular expression is used instead. In this case, only the
      <span class="Li">&quot;g&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;c&quot;</span> flags on the empty pattern are
      honored; the other flags are taken from the original pattern. If no match
      has previously succeeded, this will (silently) act instead as a genuine
      empty pattern (which will always match).
    <p class="Pp">Note that it's possible to confuse Perl into thinking
        <span class="Li">&quot;//&quot;</span> (the empty regex) is really
        <span class="Li">&quot;//&quot;</span> (the defined-or operator). Perl
        is usually pretty good about this, but some pathological cases might
        trigger this, such as <span class="Li">&quot;$a///&quot;</span> (is that
        <span class="Li">&quot;($a) / (//)&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;$a // /&quot;</span>?) and
        <span class="Li">&quot;print $fh //&quot;</span>
        (<span class="Li">&quot;print $fh(//&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;print($fh //&quot;</span>?). In all of these
        examples, Perl will assume you meant defined-or. If you meant the empty
        regex, just use parentheses or spaces to disambiguate, or even prefix
        the empty regex with an <span class="Li">&quot;m&quot;</span> (so
        <span class="Li">&quot;//&quot;</span> becomes
        <span class="Li">&quot;m//&quot;</span>).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="Matching"><a class="permalink" href="#Matching">Matching in list
    context</a></dt>
  <dd>If the <span class="Li">&quot;/g&quot;</span> option is not used,
      <span class="Li">&quot;m//&quot;</span> in list context returns a list
      consisting of the subexpressions matched by the parentheses in the
      pattern, that is, (<span class="Li">$1</span>, <span class="Li">$2</span>,
      <span class="Li">$3</span>...) (Note that here <span class="Li">$1</span>
      etc. are also set). When there are no parentheses in the pattern, the
      return value is the list <span class="Li">&quot;(1)&quot;</span> for
      success. With or without parentheses, an empty list is returned upon
      failure.
    <p class="Pp">Examples:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre> open(TTY, &quot;+&lt;/dev/tty&quot;)
    || die &quot;can't access /dev/tty: $!&quot;;
 &lt;TTY&gt; =~ /^y/i &amp;&amp; foo();       # do foo if desired
 if (/Version: *([0-9.]*)/) { $version = $1; }
 next if m#^/usr/spool/uucp#;
 # poor man's grep
 $arg = shift;
 while (&lt;&gt;) {
    print if /$arg/o; # compile only once (no longer needed!)
 }
 if (($F1, $F2, $Etc) = ($foo =~ /^(\S+)\s+(\S+)\s*(.*)/))
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This last example splits <span class="Li">$foo</span> into the
        first two words and the remainder of the line, and assigns those three
        fields to <span class="Li">$F1</span>, <span class="Li">$F2</span>, and
        <span class="Li">$Etc</span>. The conditional is true if any variables
        were assigned; that is, if the pattern matched.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;/g&quot;</span> modifier specifies
        global pattern matching--that is, matching as many times as possible
        within the string. How it behaves depends on the context. In list
        context, it returns a list of the substrings matched by any capturing
        parentheses in the regular expression. If there are no parentheses, it
        returns a list of all the matched strings, as if there were parentheses
        around the whole pattern.</p>
    <p class="Pp">In scalar context, each execution of
        <span class="Li">&quot;m//g&quot;</span> finds the next match, returning
        true if it matches, and false if there is no further match. The position
        after the last match can be read or set using the
        <span class="Li">&quot;pos()&quot;</span> function; see &quot;pos&quot;
        in perlfunc. A failed match normally resets the search position to the
        beginning of the string, but you can avoid that by adding the
        <span class="Li">&quot;/c&quot;</span> modifier (for example,
        <span class="Li">&quot;m//gc&quot;</span>). Modifying the target string
        also resets the search position.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="G"><a class="permalink" href="#G">\G assertion</a></dt>
  <dd>You can intermix <span class="Li">&quot;m//g&quot;</span> matches with
      <span class="Li">&quot;m/\G.../g&quot;</span>, where
      <span class="Li">&quot;\G&quot;</span> is a zero-width assertion that
      matches the exact position where the previous
      <span class="Li">&quot;m//g&quot;</span>, if any, left off. Without the
      <span class="Li">&quot;/g&quot;</span> modifier, the
      <span class="Li">&quot;\G&quot;</span> assertion still anchors at
      <span class="Li">&quot;pos()&quot;</span> as it was at the start of the
      operation (see &quot;pos&quot; in perlfunc), but the match is of course
      only attempted once. Using <span class="Li">&quot;\G&quot;</span> without
      <span class="Li">&quot;/g&quot;</span> on a target string that has not
      previously had a <span class="Li">&quot;/g&quot;</span> match applied to
      it is the same as using the <span class="Li">&quot;\A&quot;</span>
      assertion to match the beginning of the string. Note also that, currently,
      <span class="Li">&quot;\G&quot;</span> is only properly supported when
      anchored at the very beginning of the pattern.

        <span class="Li">&quot;pos&quot;</span> is only updated on a

        specified must be a scalar variable, an array element, a hash element,
        or an assignment to one of those; that is, some sort of scalar
      lvalue.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If the delimiter chosen is a single quote, no interpolation is
        done on either the PATTERN or the REPLACEMENT. Otherwise, if the PATTERN
        contains a $ that looks like a variable rather than an end-of-string
        test, the variable will be interpolated into the pattern at run-time. If
        you want the pattern compiled only once the first time the variable is
        interpolated, use the <span class="Li">&quot;/o&quot;</span> option. If
        the pattern evaluates to the empty string, the last successfully
        executed regular expression is used instead. See perlre for further
        explanation on these.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Options are as with m// with the addition of the following
        replacement specific options:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    e   Evaluate the right side as an expression.
    ee  Evaluate the right side as a string then eval the
        result.
    r   Return substitution and leave the original string
        untouched.
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Any non-whitespace delimiter may replace the slashes. Add
        space after the <span class="Li">&quot;s&quot;</span> when using a
        character allowed in identifiers. If single quotes are used, no
        interpretation is done on the replacement string (the
        <span class="Li">&quot;/e&quot;</span> modifier overrides this,
        however). Note that Perl treats backticks as normal delimiters; the
        replacement text is not evaluated as a command. If the PATTERN is
        delimited by bracketing quotes, the REPLACEMENT has its own pair of
        quotes, which may or may not be bracketing quotes, for example,
        <span class="Li">&quot;s(foo)(bar)&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;s&lt;foo&gt;/bar/&quot;</span>. A
        <span class="Li">&quot;/e&quot;</span> will cause the replacement
        portion to be treated as a full-fledged Perl expression and evaluated
        right then and there. It is, however, syntax checked at compile-time. A
        second <span class="Li">&quot;e&quot;</span> modifier will cause the
        replacement portion to be <span class="Li">&quot;eval&quot;</span>ed
        before being run as a Perl expression.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Examples:</p>

    <p class="Pp">Note the use of $ instead of \ in the last example. Unlike

  <dd></dd>
  <dt>`STRING`</dt>
  <dd>A string which is (possibly) interpolated and then executed as a system
      command with <i>/bin/sh</i> or its equivalent. Shell wildcards, pipes, and
      redirections will be honored. The collected standard output of the command
      is returned; standard error is unaffected. In scalar context, it comes
      back as a single (potentially multi-line) string, or undef if the command
      failed. In list context, returns a list of lines (however you've defined
      lines with $/ or <span class="Li">$INPUT_RECORD_SEPARATOR</span>), or an
      empty list if the command failed.
    <p class="Pp">Because backticks do not affect standard error, use shell file
        descriptor syntax (assuming the shell supports this) if you care to
        address this. To capture a command's STDERR and STDOUT together:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    $output = `cmd 2&gt;&amp;1`;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">To capture a command's STDOUT but discard its STDERR:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    $output = `cmd 2&gt;/dev/null`;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">To capture a command's STDERR but discard its STDOUT (ordering
        is important here):</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    $output = `cmd 2&gt;&amp;1 1&gt;/dev/null`;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">To exchange a command's STDOUT and STDERR in order to capture
        the STDERR but leave its STDOUT to come out the old STDERR:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    $output = `cmd 3&gt;&amp;1 1&gt;&amp;2 2&gt;&amp;3 3&gt;&amp;-`;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">To read both a command's STDOUT and its STDERR separately,
        it's easiest to redirect them separately to files, and then read from
        those files when the program is done:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    system(&quot;program args 1&gt;program.stdout 2&gt;program.stderr&quot;);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The STDIN filehandle used by the command is inherited from
        Perl's STDIN. For example:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    open(SPLAT, &quot;stuff&quot;)   || die &quot;can't open stuff: $!&quot;;
    open(STDIN, &quot;&lt;&amp;SPLAT&quot;) || die &quot;can't dupe SPLAT: $!&quot;;
    print STDOUT `sort`;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">will print the sorted contents of the file named
        <i>&quot;stuff&quot;</i>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Using single-quote as a delimiter protects the command from
        Perl's double-quote interpolation, passing it on to the shell
      instead:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    $perl_info  = qx(ps $$);            # that's Perl's $$
    $shell_info = qx'ps $$';            # that's the new shell's $$
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">How that string gets evaluated is entirely subject to the
        command interpreter on your system. On most platforms, you will have to
        protect shell metacharacters if you want them treated literally. This is
        in practice difficult to do, as it's unclear how to escape which
        characters. See perlsec for a clean and safe example of a manual
        <i>fork()</i> and <i>exec()</i> to emulate backticks safely.</p>
    <p class="Pp">On some platforms (notably DOS-like ones), the shell may not
        be capable of dealing with multiline commands, so putting newlines in
        the string may not get you what you want. You may be able to evaluate
        multiple commands in a single line by separating them with the command
        separator character, if your shell supports that (for example,
        <span class="Li">&quot;;&quot;</span> on many Unix shells and
        <span class="Li">&quot;&amp;&quot;</span> on the Windows NT
        <span class="Li">&quot;cmd&quot;</span> shell).</p>
    <p class="Pp">Perl will attempt to flush all files opened for output before
        starting the child process, but this may not be supported on some
        platforms (see perlport). To be safe, you may need to set
        <span class="Li">$|</span> ($AUTOFLUSH in English) or call the
        <span class="Li">&quot;autoflush()&quot;</span> method of
        <span class="Li">&quot;IO::Handle&quot;</span> on any open handles.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Beware that some command shells may place restrictions on the
        length of the command line. You must ensure your strings don't exceed
        this limit after any necessary interpolations. See the platform-specific
        release notes for more details about your particular environment.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Using this operator can lead to programs that are difficult to
        port, because the shell commands called vary between systems, and may in
        fact not be present at all. As one example, the
        <span class="Li">&quot;type&quot;</span> command under the POSIX shell
        is very different from the <span class="Li">&quot;type&quot;</span>
        command under DOS. That doesn't mean you should go out of your way to
        avoid backticks when they're the right way to get something done. Perl
        was made to be a glue language, and one of the things it glues together
        is commands. Just understand what you're getting yourself into.</p>

  <dt id="qw/STRING/"><a class="permalink" href="#qw/STRING/">qw/STRING/</a></dt>
  <dd>Evaluates to a list of the words extracted out of STRING, using embedded
      whitespace as the word delimiters. It can be understood as being roughly
      equivalent to:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    split(&quot; &quot;, q/STRING/);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">the differences being that it generates a real list at compile
        time, and in scalar context it returns the last element in the list. So
        this expression:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    qw(foo bar baz)
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">is semantically equivalent to the list:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    &quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;, &quot;baz&quot;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Some frequently seen examples:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    use POSIX qw( setlocale localeconv )
    @EXPORT = qw( foo bar baz );
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">A common mistake is to try to separate the words with comma or
        to put comments into a multi-line
        <span class="Li">&quot;qw&quot;</span>-string. For this reason, the
        <span class="Li">&quot;use warnings&quot;</span> pragma and the
        <b>-w</b> switch (that is, the <span class="Li">$^W</span> variable)
        produces warnings if the STRING contains the &quot;,&quot; or the
        &quot;#&quot; character.</p>

  <dd>Transliterates all occurrences of the characters found in the search list
      with the corresponding character in the replacement list. It returns the
      number of characters replaced or deleted. If no string is specified via
      the <span class="Li">&quot;=~&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;!~&quot;</span> operator, the
      <span class="Li">$_</span> string is transliterated.
    <p class="Pp">If the <span class="Li">&quot;/r&quot;</span>
        (non-destructive) option is present, a new copy of the string is made
        and its characters transliterated, and this copy is returned no matter
        whether it was modified or not: the original string is always left
        unchanged. The new copy is always a plain string, even if the input
        string is an object or a tied variable.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Unless the <span class="Li">&quot;/r&quot;</span> option is
        used, the string specified with <span class="Li">&quot;=~&quot;</span>
        must be a scalar variable, an array element, a hash element, or an
        assignment to one of those; in other words, an lvalue.</p>
    <p class="Pp">A character range may be specified with a hyphen, so
        <span class="Li">&quot;tr/A-J/0-9/&quot;</span> does the same
        replacement as
        <span class="Li">&quot;tr/ACEGIBDFHJ/0246813579/&quot;</span>. For
        <b>sed</b> devotees, <span class="Li">&quot;y&quot;</span> is provided
        as a synonym for <span class="Li">&quot;tr&quot;</span>. If the
        SEARCHLIST is delimited by bracketing quotes, the REPLACEMENTLIST has
        its own pair of quotes, which may or may not be bracketing quotes; for
        example, <span class="Li">&quot;tr[aeiouy][yuoiea]&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;tr(+\-*/)/ABCD/&quot;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that <span class="Li">&quot;tr&quot;</span> does
        <b>not</b> do regular expression character classes such as
        <span class="Li">&quot;\d&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;\pL&quot;</span>. The
        <span class="Li">&quot;tr&quot;</span> operator is not equivalent to the
        <i>tr</i>(1) utility. If you want to map strings between lower/upper
        cases, see &quot;lc&quot; in perlfunc and &quot;uc&quot; in perlfunc,
        and in general consider using the <span class="Li">&quot;s&quot;</span>
        operator if you need regular expressions. The
        <span class="Li">&quot;\U&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;\u&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;\L&quot;</span>, and
        <span class="Li">&quot;\l&quot;</span> string-interpolation escapes on
        the right side of a substitution operator will perform correct
        case-mappings, but <span class="Li">&quot;tr[a-z][A-Z]&quot;</span> will
        not (except sometimes on legacy 7-bit data).</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note also that the whole range idea is rather unportable
        between character sets--and even within character sets they may cause
        results you probably didn't expect. A sound principle is to use only
        ranges that begin from and end at either alphabets of equal case (a-e,
        A-E), or digits (0-4). Anything else is unsafe. If in doubt, spell out
        the character sets in full.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Options:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    c   Complement the SEARCHLIST.
    d   Delete found but unreplaced characters.
    s   Squash duplicate replaced characters.
    r   Return the modified string and leave the original string
        untouched.
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If the <span class="Li">&quot;/c&quot;</span> modifier is
        specified, the SEARCHLIST character set is complemented. If the
        <span class="Li">&quot;/d&quot;</span> modifier is specified, any
        characters specified by SEARCHLIST not found in REPLACEMENTLIST are
        deleted. (Note that this is slightly more flexible than the behavior of
        some <b>tr</b> programs, which delete anything they find in the
        SEARCHLIST, period.) If the <span class="Li">&quot;/s&quot;</span>
        modifier is specified, sequences of characters that were transliterated
        to the same character are squashed down to a single instance of the
        character.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If the <span class="Li">&quot;/d&quot;</span> modifier is
        used, the REPLACEMENTLIST is always interpreted exactly as specified.
        Otherwise, if the REPLACEMENTLIST is shorter than the SEARCHLIST, the
        final character is replicated till it is long enough. If the
        REPLACEMENTLIST is empty, the SEARCHLIST is replicated. This latter is
        useful for counting characters in a class or for squashing character
        sequences in a class.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Examples:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    $ARGV[1] =~ tr/A-Z/a-z/;    # canonicalize to lower case ASCII
    $cnt = tr/*/*/;             # count the stars in $_
    $cnt = $sky =~ tr/*/*/;     # count the stars in $sky
    $cnt = tr/0-9//;            # count the digits in $_
    tr/a-zA-Z//s;               # bookkeeper -&gt; bokeper
    ($HOST = $host) =~ tr/a-z/A-Z/;
     $HOST = $host  =~ tr/a-z/A-Z/r;   # same thing
    $HOST = $host =~ tr/a-z/A-Z/r    # chained with s///r
                  =~ s/:/ -p/r;
    tr/a-zA-Z/ /cs;             # change non-alphas to single space
    @stripped = map tr/a-zA-Z/ /csr, @original;
                                # /r with map
    tr [\200-\377]
       [\000-\177];             # wickedly delete 8th bit
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If multiple transliterations are given for a character, only
        the first one is used:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    tr/AAA/XYZ/
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">will transliterate any A to X.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Because the transliteration table is built at compile time,
        neither the SEARCHLIST nor the REPLACEMENTLIST are subjected to double
        quote interpolation. That means that if you want to use variables, you
        must use an <i>eval()</i>:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    eval &quot;tr/$oldlist/$newlist/&quot;;
    die $@ if $@;
    eval &quot;tr/$oldlist/$newlist/, 1&quot; or die $@;
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>&lt;&lt;EOF </dt>
  <dd>A line-oriented form of quoting is based on the shell
      &quot;here-document&quot; syntax. Following a
      <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;&lt;&quot;</span> you specify a string to
      terminate the quoted material, and all lines following the current line
      down to the terminating string are the value of the item.
    <p class="Pp">The terminating string may be either an identifier (a word),
        or some quoted text. An unquoted identifier works like double quotes.
        There may not be a space between the
        <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;&lt;&quot;</span> and the identifier, unless
        the identifier is explicitly quoted. (If you put a space it will be
        treated as a null identifier, which is valid, and matches the first
        empty line.) The terminating string must appear by itself (unquoted and
        with no surrounding whitespace) on the terminating line.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If the terminating string is quoted, the type of quotes used
        determine the treatment of the text.</p>

<p class="Pp">If you use a here-doc within a delimited construct, such as in

<p class="Pp">Additionally, quoting rules for the end-of-string identifier are
    unrelated to Perl's quoting rules. <span class="Li">&quot;q()&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;qq()&quot;</span>, and the like are not supported in
    place of <span class="Li">''</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;&quot;</span>, and the only interpolation is for
    backslashing the quoting character:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    print &lt;&lt; &quot;abc\&quot;def&quot;;
    testing...
    abc&quot;def
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Finally, quoted strings cannot span multiple lines. The general
    rule is that the identifier must be a string literal. Stick with that, and
    you should be safe.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Gory_details_of_parsing_quoted_constructs"><a class="permalink" href="#Gory_details_of_parsing_quoted_constructs">Gory
  details of parsing quoted constructs</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">When presented with something that might have several different
    interpretations, Perl uses the <b>DWIM</b> (that's &quot;Do What I
    Mean&quot;) principle to pick the most probable interpretation. This
    strategy is so successful that Perl programmers often do not suspect the
    ambivalence of what they write. But from time to time, Perl's notions differ
    substantially from what the author honestly meant.</p>
<p class="Pp">This section hopes to clarify how Perl handles quoted constructs.
    Although the most common reason to learn this is to unravel labyrinthine
    regular expressions, because the initial steps of parsing are the same for
    all quoting operators, they are all discussed together.</p>
<p class="Pp">The most important Perl parsing rule is the first one discussed
    below: when processing a quoted construct, Perl first finds the end of that
    construct, then interprets its contents. If you understand this rule, you
    may skip the rest of this section on the first reading. The other rules are
    likely to contradict the user's expectations much less frequently than this
    first one.</p>
<p class="Pp">Some passes discussed below are performed concurrently, but
    because their results are the same, we consider them individually. For
    different quoting constructs, Perl performs different numbers of passes,
    from one to four, but these passes are always performed in the same
  order.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="Finding"><a class="permalink" href="#Finding">Finding the end</a></dt>
  <dd>The first pass is finding the end of the quoted construct, where the
      information about the delimiters is used in parsing. During this search,
      text between the starting and ending delimiters is copied to a safe
      location. The text copied gets delimiter-independent.
    <p class="Pp">If the construct is a here-doc, the ending delimiter is a line
        that has a terminating string as the content. Therefore
        <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;&lt;EOF&quot;</span> is terminated by
        <span class="Li">&quot;EOF&quot;</span> immediately followed by
        <span class="Li">&quot;\n&quot;</span> and starting from the first
        column of the terminating line. When searching for the terminating line
        of a here-doc, nothing is skipped. In other words, lines after the
        here-doc syntax are compared with the terminating string line by
      line.</p>
    <p class="Pp">For the constructs except here-docs, single characters are
        used as starting and ending delimiters. If the starting delimiter is an
        opening punctuation (that is <span class="Li">&quot;(&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;[&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;{&quot;</span>, or
        <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;&quot;</span>), the ending delimiter is the
        corresponding closing punctuation (that is
        <span class="Li">&quot;)&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;]&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;}&quot;</span>, or
        <span class="Li">&quot;&gt;&quot;</span>). If the starting delimiter is
        an unpaired character like <span class="Li">&quot;/&quot;</span> or a
        closing punctuation, the ending delimiter is same as the starting
        delimiter. Therefore a <span class="Li">&quot;/&quot;</span> terminates
        a <span class="Li">&quot;qq//&quot;</span> construct, while a
        <span class="Li">&quot;]&quot;</span> terminates
        <span class="Li">&quot;qq[]&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;qq]]&quot;</span> constructs.</p>
    <p class="Pp">When searching for single-character delimiters, escaped
        delimiters and <span class="Li">&quot;\\&quot;</span> are skipped. For
        example, while searching for terminating
        <span class="Li">&quot;/&quot;</span>, combinations of
        <span class="Li">&quot;\\&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;\/&quot;</span> are skipped. If the delimiters
        are bracketing, nested pairs are also skipped. For example, while
        searching for closing <span class="Li">&quot;]&quot;</span> paired with
        the opening <span class="Li">&quot;[&quot;</span>, combinations of
        <span class="Li">&quot;\\&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;\]&quot;</span>, and
        <span class="Li">&quot;\[&quot;</span> are all skipped, and nested
        <span class="Li">&quot;[&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;]&quot;</span> are skipped as well. However, when
        backslashes are used as the delimiters (like
        <span class="Li">&quot;qq\\&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;tr\\\&quot;</span>), nothing is skipped. During
        the search for the end, backslashes that escape delimiters or other
        backslashes are removed (exactly speaking, they are not copied to the
        safe location).</p>
    <p class="Pp">For constructs with three-part delimiters
        (<span class="Li">&quot;s///&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;y///&quot;</span>, and
        <span class="Li">&quot;tr///&quot;</span>), the search is repeated once
        more. If the first delimiter is not an opening punctuation, three
        delimiters must be same such as <span class="Li">&quot;s!!!&quot;</span>
        and <span class="Li">&quot;tr)))&quot;</span>, in which case the second
        delimiter terminates the left part and starts the right part at once. If
        the left part is delimited by bracketing punctuation (that is
        <span class="Li">&quot;()&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;[]&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;{}&quot;</span>, or
        <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;&gt;&quot;</span>), the right part needs
        another pair of delimiters such as
        <span class="Li">&quot;s(){}&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;tr[]//&quot;</span>. In these cases, whitespace
        and comments are allowed between both parts, though the comment must
        follow at least one whitespace character; otherwise a character expected
        as the start of the comment may be regarded as the starting delimiter of
        the right part.</p>
    <p class="Pp">During this search no attention is paid to the semantics of
        the construct. Thus:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    &quot;$hash{&quot;$foo/$bar&quot;}&quot;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">or:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    m/
      bar       # NOT a comment, this slash / terminated m//!
     /x
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">do not form legal quoted expressions. The quoted part ends on
        the first <span class="Li">&quot;&quot;&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;/&quot;</span>, and the rest happens to be a
        syntax error. Because the slash that terminated
        <span class="Li">&quot;m//&quot;</span> was followed by a
        <span class="Li">&quot;SPACE&quot;</span>, the example above is not
        <span class="Li">&quot;m//x&quot;</span>, but rather
        <span class="Li">&quot;m//&quot;</span> with no
        <span class="Li">&quot;/x&quot;</span> modifier. So the embedded
        <span class="Li">&quot;#&quot;</span> is interpreted as a literal
        <span class="Li">&quot;#&quot;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Also no attention is paid to
        <span class="Li">&quot;\c\&quot;</span> (multichar control char syntax)
        during this search. Thus the second
        <span class="Li">&quot;\&quot;</span> in
        <span class="Li">&quot;qq/\c\/&quot;</span> is interpreted as a part of
        <span class="Li">&quot;\/&quot;</span>, and the following
        <span class="Li">&quot;/&quot;</span> is not recognized as a delimiter.
        Instead, use <span class="Li">&quot;\034&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;\x1c&quot;</span> at the end of quoted
        constructs.</p>

      <span class="Li">&quot;tr'''&quot;</span> and

      <span class="Li">&quot;\F&quot;</span> (possibly paired with
      <span class="Li">&quot;\E&quot;</span>) are converted to corresponding
      Perl constructs. Thus, <span class="Li">&quot;$foo\Qbaz$bar&quot;</span>
      is converted to <span class="Li">&quot;$foo . (quotemeta(&quot;baz&quot; .
      $bar))&quot;</span> internally. The other escape sequences such as
      <span class="Li">&quot;\200&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;\t&quot;</span> and backslashed characters such as
      <span class="Li">&quot;\\&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;\-&quot;</span> are replaced with appropriate
      expansions.
    <p class="Pp">Let it be stressed that <i>whatever falls between
        </i><span class="Li"><i>&quot;\Q&quot;</i></span><i> and
        </i><span class="Li"><i>&quot;\E&quot;</i></span><i></i> is interpolated
        in the usual way. Something like
        <span class="Li">&quot;\Q\\E&quot;</span> has no
        <span class="Li">&quot;\E&quot;</span> inside. Instead, it has
        <span class="Li">&quot;\Q&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;\\&quot;</span>, and
        <span class="Li">&quot;E&quot;</span>, so the result is the same as for
        <span class="Li">&quot;\\\\E&quot;</span>. As a general rule,
        backslashes between <span class="Li">&quot;\Q&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;\E&quot;</span> may lead to counterintuitive
        results. So, <span class="Li">&quot;\Q\t\E&quot;</span> is converted to
        <span class="Li">&quot;quotemeta(&quot;\t&quot;)&quot;</span>, which is
        the same as <span class="Li">&quot;\\\t&quot;</span> (since TAB is not
        alphanumeric). Note also that:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>  $str = '\t';
  return &quot;\Q$str&quot;;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">may be closer to the conjectural <i>intention</i> of the
        writer of <span class="Li">&quot;\Q\t\E&quot;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Interpolated scalars and arrays are converted internally to
        the <span class="Li">&quot;join&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;.&quot;</span> catenation operations. Thus,
        <span class="Li">&quot;$foo XXX '@arr'&quot;</span> becomes:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>  $foo . &quot; XXX '&quot; . (join $&quot;, @arr) . &quot;'&quot;;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">All operations above are performed simultaneously, left to
        right.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Because the result of <span class="Li">&quot;\Q STRING
        \E&quot;</span> has all metacharacters quoted, there is no way to insert
        a literal <span class="Li">&quot;$&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;@&quot;</span> inside a
        <span class="Li">&quot;\Q\E&quot;</span> pair. If protected by
        <span class="Li">&quot;\&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;$&quot;</span> will be quoted to became
        <span class="Li">&quot;\\\$&quot;</span>; if not, it is interpreted as
        the start of an interpolated scalar.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note also that the interpolation code needs to make a decision
        on where the interpolated scalar ends. For instance, whether
        <span class="Li">&quot;a $b -&gt; {c}&quot;</span> really means:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>  &quot;a &quot; . $b . &quot; -&gt; {c}&quot;;

        <span class="Li">&quot;\&quot;</span> followed by a character are not
        substituted but only skipped, in order to parse them as regular
        expressions at the following step. As
        <span class="Li">&quot;\c&quot;</span> is skipped at this step,
        <span class="Li">&quot;@&quot;</span> of
        <span class="Li">&quot;\c@&quot;</span> in RE is possibly treated as an
        array symbol (for example <span class="Li">@foo</span>), even though the
        same text in <span class="Li">&quot;qq//&quot;</span> gives
        interpolation of <span class="Li">&quot;\c@&quot;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Code blocks such as
        <span class="Li">&quot;(?{BLOCK})&quot;</span> are handled by
        temporarily passing control back to the perl parser, in a similar way
        that an interpolated array subscript expression such as
        <span class="Li">&quot;foo$array[1+f(&quot;[xyz&quot;)]bar&quot;</span>
        would be.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Moreover, inside
        <span class="Li">&quot;(?{BLOCK})&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;(?# comment )&quot;</span>, and a
        <span class="Li">&quot;#&quot;</span>-comment in a
        <span class="Li">&quot;//x&quot;</span>-regular expression, no
        processing is performed whatsoever. This is the first step at which the
        presence of the <span class="Li">&quot;//x&quot;</span> modifier is
        relevant.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Interpolation in patterns has several quirks:
        <span class="Li">$|</span>, <span class="Li">$(</span>,
        <span class="Li">$)</span>, <span class="Li">&quot;@+&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;@-&quot;</span> are not interpolated, and
        constructs <span class="Li">$var[SOMETHING]</span> are voted (by several
        different estimators) to be either an array element or
        <span class="Li">$var</span> followed by an RE alternative. This is
        where the notation <span class="Li">&quot;${arr[$bar]}&quot;</span>
        comes handy: <span class="Li">&quot;/${arr[0-9]}/&quot;</span> is
        interpreted as array element <span class="Li">&quot;-9&quot;</span>, not
        as a regular expression from the variable <span class="Li">$arr</span>
        followed by a digit, which would be the interpretation of
        <span class="Li">&quot;/$arr[0-9]/&quot;</span>. Since voting among
        different estimators may occur, the result is not predictable.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The lack of processing of
        <span class="Li">&quot;\\&quot;</span> creates specific restrictions on
        the post-processed text. If the delimiter is
        <span class="Li">&quot;/&quot;</span>, one cannot get the combination
        <span class="Li">&quot;\/&quot;</span> into the result of this step.
        <span class="Li">&quot;/&quot;</span> will finish the regular
        expression, <span class="Li">&quot;\/&quot;</span> will be stripped to
        <span class="Li">&quot;/&quot;</span> on the previous step, and
        <span class="Li">&quot;\\/&quot;</span> will be left as is. Because
        <span class="Li">&quot;/&quot;</span> is equivalent to
        <span class="Li">&quot;\/&quot;</span> inside a regular expression, this
        does not matter unless the delimiter happens to be character special to
        the RE engine, such as in
        <span class="Li">&quot;s*foo*bar*&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;m[foo]&quot;</span>, or
        <span class="Li">&quot;?foo?&quot;</span>; or an alphanumeric char, as
        in:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>  m m ^ a \s* b mmx;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">In the RE above, which is intentionally obfuscated for
        illustration, the delimiter is <span class="Li">&quot;m&quot;</span>,
        the modifier is <span class="Li">&quot;mx&quot;</span>, and after
        delimiter-removal the RE is the same as for <span class="Li">&quot;m/ ^
        a \s* b /mx&quot;</span>. There's more than one reason you're encouraged
        to restrict your delimiters to non-alphanumeric, non-whitespace
      choices.</p>

  <dd>Previous steps were performed during the compilation of Perl code, but
      this one happens at run time, although it may be optimized to be
      calculated at compile time if appropriate. After preprocessing described
      above, and possibly after evaluation if concatenation, joining, casing
      translation, or metaquoting are involved, the resulting <i>string</i> is
      passed to the RE engine for compilation.
    <p class="Pp">Whatever happens in the RE engine might be better discussed in
        perlre, but for the sake of continuity, we shall do so here.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This is another step where the presence of the
        <span class="Li">&quot;//x&quot;</span> modifier is relevant. The RE
        engine scans the string from left to right and converts it to a finite
        automaton.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Backslashed characters are either replaced with corresponding
        literal strings (as with <span class="Li">&quot;\{&quot;</span>), or
        else they generate special nodes in the finite automaton (as with
        <span class="Li">&quot;\b&quot;</span>). Characters special to the RE
        engine (such as <span class="Li">&quot;|&quot;</span>) generate
        corresponding nodes or groups of nodes.
        <span class="Li">&quot;(?#...)&quot;</span> comments are ignored. All
        the rest is either converted to literal strings to match, or else is
        ignored (as is whitespace and
        <span class="Li">&quot;#&quot;</span>-style comments if
        <span class="Li">&quot;//x&quot;</span> is present).</p>
    <p class="Pp">Parsing of the bracketed character class construct,
        <span class="Li">&quot;[...]&quot;</span>, is rather different than the
        rule used for the rest of the pattern. The terminator of this construct
        is found using the same rules as for finding the terminator of a
        <span class="Li">&quot;{}&quot;</span>-delimited construct, the only
        exception being that <span class="Li">&quot;]&quot;</span> immediately
        following <span class="Li">&quot;[&quot;</span> is treated as though
        preceded by a backslash.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The terminator of runtime
        <span class="Li">&quot;(?{...})&quot;</span> is found by temporarily
        switching control to the perl parser, which should stop at the point
        where the logically balancing terminating
        <span class="Li">&quot;}&quot;</span> is found.</p>
    <p class="Pp">It is possible to inspect both the string given to RE engine
        and the resulting finite automaton. See the arguments

<h2 class="Ss" id="I/O_Operators"><a class="permalink" href="#I/O_Operators">I/O
  Operators</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">There are several I/O operators you should know about.</p>
<p class="Pp">A string enclosed by backticks (grave accents) first undergoes
    double-quote interpolation. It is then interpreted as an external command,
    and the output of that command is the value of the backtick string, like in
    a shell. In scalar context, a single string consisting of all output is
    returned. In list context, a list of values is returned, one per line of
    output. (You can set <span class="Li">$/</span> to use a different line
    terminator.) The command is executed each time the pseudo-literal is
    evaluated. The status value of the command is returned in
    <span class="Li">$?</span> (see perlvar for the interpretation of
    <span class="Li">$?</span>). Unlike in <b>csh</b>, no translation is done on
    the return data--newlines remain newlines. Unlike in any of the shells,
    single quotes do not hide variable names in the command from interpretation.
    To pass a literal dollar-sign through to the shell you need to hide it with
    a backslash. The generalized form of backticks is
    <span class="Li">&quot;qx//&quot;</span>. (Because backticks always undergo
    shell expansion as well, see perlsec for security concerns.)</p>
<p class="Pp">In scalar context, evaluating a filehandle in angle brackets
    yields the next line from that file (the newline, if any, included), or
    <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> at end-of-file or on error. When
    <span class="Li">$/</span> is set to
    <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> (sometimes known as file-slurp
    mode) and the file is empty, it returns <span class="Li">''</span> the first
    time, followed by <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span>
  subsequently.</p>
<p class="Pp">Ordinarily you must assign the returned value to a variable, but
    there is one situation where an automatic assignment happens. If and only if
    the input symbol is the only thing inside the conditional of a
    <span class="Li">&quot;while&quot;</span> statement (even if disguised as a
    <span class="Li">&quot;for(;;)&quot;</span> loop), the value is
    automatically assigned to the global variable <span class="Li">$_</span>,
    destroying whatever was there previously. (This may seem like an odd thing
    to you, but you'll use the construct in almost every Perl script you write.)
    The <span class="Li">$_</span> variable is not implicitly localized. You'll
    have to put a <span class="Li">&quot;local $_;&quot;</span> before the loop
    if you want that to happen.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following lines are equivalent:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    while (defined($_ = &lt;STDIN&gt;)) { print; }
    while ($_ = &lt;STDIN&gt;) { print; }
    while (&lt;STDIN&gt;) { print; }
    for (;&lt;STDIN&gt;;) { print; }
    print while defined($_ = &lt;STDIN&gt;);
    print while ($_ = &lt;STDIN&gt;);
    print while &lt;STDIN&gt;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This also behaves similarly, but assigns to a lexical variable
    instead of to <span class="Li">$_</span>:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    while (my $line = &lt;STDIN&gt;) { print $line }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">In these loop constructs, the assigned value (whether assignment
    is automatic or explicit) is then tested to see whether it is defined. The
    defined test avoids problems where the line has a string value that would be
    treated as false by Perl; for example a &quot;&quot; or a &quot;0&quot; with
    no trailing newline. If you really mean for such values to terminate the
    loop, they should be tested for explicitly:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    while (($_ = &lt;STDIN&gt;) ne '0') { ... }
    while (&lt;STDIN&gt;) { last unless $_; ... }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">In other boolean contexts,
    <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;FILEHANDLE&gt;&quot;</span> without an explicit
    <span class="Li">&quot;defined&quot;</span> test or comparison elicits a
    warning if the <span class="Li">&quot;use warnings&quot;</span> pragma or
    the <b>-w</b> command-line switch (the <span class="Li">$^W</span> variable)
    is in effect.</p>
<p class="Pp">The filehandles STDIN, STDOUT, and STDERR are predefined. (The
    filehandles <span class="Li">&quot;stdin&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;stdout&quot;</span>, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;stderr&quot;</span> will also work except in
    packages, where they would be interpreted as local identifiers rather than
    global.) Additional filehandles may be created with the <i>open()</i>
    function, amongst others. See perlopentut and &quot;open&quot; in perlfunc
    for details on this.</p>
<p class="Pp">If a &lt;FILEHANDLE&gt; is used in a context that is looking for a
    list, a list comprising all input lines is returned, one line per list
    element. It's easy to grow to a rather large data space this way, so use
    with care.</p>
<p class="Pp">&lt;FILEHANDLE&gt; may also be spelled
    <span class="Li">&quot;readline(*FILEHANDLE)&quot;</span>. See
    &quot;readline&quot; in perlfunc.</p>
<p class="Pp">The null filehandle &lt;&gt; is special: it can be used to emulate
    the behavior of <b>sed</b> and <b>awk</b>, and any other Unix filter program
    that takes a list of filenames, doing the same to each line of input from
    all of them. Input from &lt;&gt; comes either from standard input, or from
    each file listed on the command line. Here's how it works: the first time
    &lt;&gt; is evaluated, the <span class="Li">@ARGV</span> array is checked,
    and if it is empty, <span class="Li">$ARGV[0]</span> is set to
    &quot;-&quot;, which when opened gives you standard input. The
    <span class="Li">@ARGV</span> array is then processed as a list of
    filenames. The loop</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    while (&lt;&gt;) {
        ...                     # code for each line
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">is equivalent to the following Perl-like pseudo code:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    unshift(@ARGV, '-') unless @ARGV;
    while ($ARGV = shift) {
        open(ARGV, $ARGV);
        while (&lt;ARGV&gt;) {
            ...         # code for each line
        }
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">except that it isn't so cumbersome to say, and will actually work.
    It really does shift the <span class="Li">@ARGV</span> array and put the
    current filename into the <span class="Li">$ARGV</span> variable. It also
    uses filehandle <i>ARGV</i> internally. &lt;&gt; is just a synonym for
    &lt;ARGV&gt;, which is magical. (The pseudo code above doesn't work because
    it treats &lt;ARGV&gt; as non-magical.)</p>
<p class="Pp">Since the null filehandle uses the two argument form of
    &quot;open&quot; in perlfunc it interprets special characters, so if you
    have a script like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    while (&lt;&gt;) {
        print;
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">and call it with <span class="Li">&quot;perl dangerous.pl 'rm -rfv
    *|'&quot;</span>, it actually opens a pipe, executes the
    <span class="Li">&quot;rm&quot;</span> command and reads
    <span class="Li">&quot;rm&quot;</span>'s output from that pipe. If you want
    all items in <span class="Li">@ARGV</span> to be interpreted as file names,
    you can use the module <span class="Li">&quot;ARGV::readonly&quot;</span>
    from CPAN.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can modify <span class="Li">@ARGV</span> before the first
    &lt;&gt; as long as the array ends up containing the list of filenames you
    really want. Line numbers (<span class="Li">$.</span>) continue as though
    the input were one big happy file. See the example in &quot;eof&quot; in
    perlfunc for how to reset line numbers on each file.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you want to set <span class="Li">@ARGV</span> to your own list
    of files, go right ahead. This sets <span class="Li">@ARGV</span> to all
    plain text files if no <span class="Li">@ARGV</span> was given:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    @ARGV = grep { -f &amp;&amp; -T } glob('*') unless @ARGV;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">You can even set them to pipe commands. For example, this
    automatically filters compressed arguments through <b>gzip</b>:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    @ARGV = map { /\.(gz|Z)$/ ? &quot;gzip -dc &lt; $_ |&quot; : $_ } @ARGV;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If you want to pass switches into your script, you can use one of
    the Getopts modules or put a loop on the front like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    while ($_ = $ARGV[0], /^-/) {
        shift;
        last if /^--$/;
        if (/^-D(.*)/) { $debug = $1 }
        if (/^-v/)     { $verbose++  }
        # ...           # other switches
    }
    while (&lt;&gt;) {
        # ...           # code for each line
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The &lt;&gt; symbol will return
    <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> for end-of-file only once. If you
    call it again after this, it will assume you are processing another
    <span class="Li">@ARGV</span> list, and if you haven't set
    <span class="Li">@ARGV</span>, will read input from STDIN.</p>
<p class="Pp">If what the angle brackets contain is a simple scalar variable
    (for example, &lt;$foo&gt;), then that variable contains the name of the
    filehandle to input from, or its typeglob, or a reference to the same. For
    example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    $fh = \*STDIN;
    $line = &lt;$fh&gt;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If what's within the angle brackets is neither a filehandle nor a
    simple scalar variable containing a filehandle name, typeglob, or typeglob
    reference, it is interpreted as a filename pattern to be globbed, and either
    a list of filenames or the next filename in the list is returned, depending
    on context. This distinction is determined on syntactic grounds alone. That
    means <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;$x&gt;&quot;</span> is always a
    <i>readline()</i> from an indirect handle, but
    <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;$hash{key}&gt;&quot;</span> is always a
    <i>glob()</i>. That's because <span class="Li">$x</span> is a simple scalar
    variable, but <span class="Li">$hash{key}</span> is not--it's a hash
    element. Even <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;$x &gt;&quot;</span> (note the
    extra space) is treated as <span class="Li">&quot;glob(&quot;$x
    &quot;)&quot;</span>, not
  <span class="Li">&quot;readline($x)&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">One level of double-quote interpretation is done first, but you
    can't say <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;$foo&gt;&quot;</span> because that's an
    indirect filehandle as explained in the previous paragraph. (In older
    versions of Perl, programmers would insert curly brackets to force
    interpretation as a filename glob:
    <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;${foo}&gt;&quot;</span>. These days, it's
    considered cleaner to call the internal function directly as
    <span class="Li">&quot;glob($foo)&quot;</span>, which is probably the right
    way to have done it in the first place.) For example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    while (&lt;*.c&gt;) {
        chmod 0644, $_;
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">is roughly equivalent to:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    open(FOO, &quot;echo *.c | tr -s ' \t\r\f' '\\012\\012\\012\\012'|&quot;);
    while (&lt;FOO&gt;) {
        chomp;
        chmod 0644, $_;
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">except that the globbing is actually done internally using the
    standard <span class="Li">&quot;File::Glob&quot;</span> extension. Of
    course, the shortest way to do the above is:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    chmod 0644, &lt;*.c&gt;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">A (file)glob evaluates its (embedded) argument only when it is
    starting a new list. All values must be read before it will start over. In
    list context, this isn't important because you automatically get them all
    anyway. However, in scalar context the operator returns the next value each
    time it's called, or <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> when the list
    has run out. As with filehandle reads, an automatic
    <span class="Li">&quot;defined&quot;</span> is generated when the glob
    occurs in the test part of a <span class="Li">&quot;while&quot;</span>,
    because legal glob returns (for example, a file called <i>0</i>) would
    otherwise terminate the loop. Again,
    <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> is returned only once. So if
    you're expecting a single value from a glob, it is much better to say</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    ($file) = &lt;blurch*&gt;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">than</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    $file = &lt;blurch*&gt;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">because the latter will alternate between returning a filename and
    returning false.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you're trying to do variable interpolation, it's definitely
    better to use the <i>glob()</i> function, because the older notation can
    cause people to become confused with the indirect filehandle notation.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    @files = glob(&quot;$dir/*.[ch]&quot;);
    @files = glob($files[$i]);

    granularity for such extension or truncation is one or more bytes.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    # ASCII-based examples
    print &quot;j p \n&quot; ^ &quot; a h&quot;;            # prints &quot;JAPH\n&quot;

</pre>
<p class="Pp">If you are intending to manipulate bitstrings, be certain that
    you're supplying bitstrings: If an operand is a number, that will imply a
    <b>numeric</b> bitwise operation. You may explicitly show which type of
    operation you intend by using <span class="Li">&quot;&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;0+&quot;</span>, as in the examples below.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    $foo =  150  |  105;        # yields 255  (0x96 | 0x69 is 0xFF)

    $foo =  150  | '105';       # yields 255
    $foo = '150' | '105';       # yields string '155' (under ASCII)
    $baz = 0+$foo &amp; 0+$bar;     # both ops explicitly numeric

<h2 class="Ss" id="Integer_Arithmetic"><a class="permalink" href="#Integer_Arithmetic">Integer
  Arithmetic</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">By default, Perl assumes that it must do most of its arithmetic in
    floating point. But by saying</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    use integer;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">you may tell the compiler to use integer operations (see integer
    for a detailed explanation) from here to the end of the enclosing BLOCK. An
    inner BLOCK may countermand this by saying</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    no integer;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">which lasts until the end of that BLOCK. Note that this doesn't
    mean everything is an integer, merely that Perl will use integer operations
    for arithmetic, comparison, and bitwise operators. For example, even under
    <span class="Li">&quot;use integer&quot;</span>, if you take the
    <span class="Li">sqrt(2)</span>, you'll still get
    <span class="Li">1.4142135623731</span> or so.</p>
<p class="Pp">Used on numbers, the bitwise operators (&quot;&amp;&quot;,
    &quot;|&quot;, &quot;^&quot;, &quot;~&quot;, &quot;&lt;&lt;&quot;, and
    &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;) always produce integral results. (But see also
    &quot;Bitwise String Operators&quot;.) However, <span class="Li">&quot;use
    integer&quot;</span> still has meaning for them. By default, their results
    are interpreted as unsigned integers, but if <span class="Li">&quot;use
    integer&quot;</span> is in effect, their results are interpreted as signed
    integers. For example, <span class="Li">&quot;~0&quot;</span> usually
    evaluates to a large integral value. However, <span class="Li">&quot;use
    integer; ~0&quot;</span> is <span class="Li">&quot;-1&quot;</span> on
    two's-complement machines.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Floating-point_Arithmetic"><a class="permalink" href="#Floating-point_Arithmetic">Floating-point
  Arithmetic</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">While <span class="Li">&quot;use integer&quot;</span> provides
    integer-only arithmetic, there is no analogous mechanism to provide
    automatic rounding or truncation to a certain number of decimal places. For
    rounding to a certain number of digits, <i>sprintf()</i> or <i>printf()</i>
    is usually the easiest route. See perlfaq4.</p>
<p class="Pp">Floating-point numbers are only approximations to what a
    mathematician would call real numbers. There are infinitely more reals than
    floats, so some corners must be cut. For example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    printf &quot;%.20g\n&quot;, 123456789123456789;
    #        produces 123456789123456784
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Testing for exact floating-point equality or inequality is not a
    good idea. Here's a (relatively expensive) work-around to compare whether
    two floating-point numbers are equal to a particular number of decimal
    places. See Knuth, volume II, for a more robust treatment of this topic.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    sub fp_equal {
        my ($X, $Y, $POINTS) = @_;
        my ($tX, $tY);
        $tX = sprintf(&quot;%.${POINTS}g&quot;, $X);
        $tY = sprintf(&quot;%.${POINTS}g&quot;, $Y);
        return $tX eq $tY;
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The POSIX module (part of the standard perl distribution)
    implements <i>ceil()</i>, <i>floor()</i>, and other mathematical and
    trigonometric functions. The Math::Complex module (part of the standard perl
    distribution) defines mathematical functions that work on both the reals and
    the imaginary numbers. Math::Complex not as efficient as POSIX, but POSIX
    can't work with complex numbers.</p>
<p class="Pp">Rounding in financial applications can have serious implications,
    and the rounding method used should be specified precisely. In these cases,
    it probably pays not to trust whichever system rounding is being used by
    Perl, but to instead implement the rounding function you need yourself.</p>

<p class="Pp">Several modules let you calculate with (bound only by memory and
    CPU time) unlimited or fixed precision. There are also some non-standard

  Math::BigIntFast       Bit::Vector wrapper for big numbers
  Math::Pari             provides access to the Pari C library
  Math::Cephes           uses the external Cephes C library (no

  Math::Cephes::Fraction fractions via the Cephes library
  Math::GMP              another one using an external C library
  Math::GMPz             an alternative interface to libgmp's big ints
  Math::GMPq             an interface to libgmp's fraction numbers
