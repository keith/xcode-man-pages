perlaix - Perl version 5 on IBM AIX (UNIX) systems
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
This document describes various features of IBM's UNIX operating system AIX that
  will affect how Perl version 5 (hereafter just Perl) is compiled and/or runs.
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Compiling_Perl_5_on__s-1AIX_s0"><a class="permalink" href="#Compiling_Perl_5_on__s-1AIX_s0">Compiling
  Perl 5 on AIX</a></h2>
For information on compilers on older versions of AIX, see &quot;Compiling Perl
  5 on older AIX versions up to 4.3.3&quot;.
<p class="Pp">When compiling Perl, you must use an ANSI C compiler. AIX does not
    ship an ANSI compliant C compiler with AIX by default, but binary builds of
    gcc for AIX are widely available. A version of gcc is also included in the
    AIX Toolbox which is shipped with AIX.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Supported_Compilers"><a class="permalink" href="#Supported_Compilers">Supported
  Compilers</a></h2>
Currently all versions of IBM's &quot;xlc&quot;, &quot;xlc_r&quot;,
  &quot;cc&quot;, &quot;cc_r&quot; or &quot;vac&quot; ANSI/C compiler will work
  for building Perl if that compiler works on your system.
<p class="Pp">If you plan to link Perl to any module that requires
    thread-support, like DBD::Oracle, it is better to use the _r version of the
    compiler. This will not build a threaded Perl, but a thread-enabled Perl.
    See also &quot;Threaded Perl&quot; later on.</p>
<p class="Pp">As of writing (2010-09) only the <i>IBM XL C for AIX</i> or <i>IBM
    XL C/C++</i> <i>for AIX</i> compiler is supported by IBM on AIX
  5L/6.1/7.1.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following compiler versions are currently supported by
  IBM:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    IBM XL C and IBM XL C/C++ V8, V9, V10, V11
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The XL C for AIX is integrated in the XL C/C++ for AIX compiler
    and therefore also supported.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you choose XL C/C++ V9 you need APAR IZ35785 installed
    otherwise the integrated SDBM_File do not compile correctly due to an
    optimization bug. You can circumvent this problem by adding -qipa to the
    optimization flags (-Doptimize='-O -qipa'). The PTF for APAR IZ35785 which
    solves this problem is available from IBM (April 2009 PTF for XL C/C++
    Enterprise Edition for AIX, V9.0).</p>
<p class="Pp">If you choose XL C/C++ V11 you need the April 2010 PTF (or newer)
    installed otherwise you will not get a working Perl version.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl can be compiled with either IBM's ANSI C compiler or with
    gcc. The former is recommended, as not only it can compile Perl with no
    difficulty, but also can take advantage of features listed later that
    require the use of IBM compiler-specific command-line flags.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you decide to use gcc, make sure your installation is recent
    and complete, and be sure to read the Perl INSTALL file for more
    gcc-specific details. Please report any hoops you had to jump through to the
    development team.</p>

  with AIX Toolbox lib gdbm</a></h2>
If the AIX Toolbox version of lib gdbm &lt; 1.8.3-5 is installed on your system
  then Perl will not work. This library contains the header files
  /opt/freeware/include/gdbm/dbm.h|ndbm.h which conflict with the AIX system
  versions. The lib gdbm will be automatically removed from the wanted libraries
  if the presence of one of these two header files is detected. If you want to
  build Perl with GDBM support then please install at least gdbm-devel-1.8.3-5
  (or higher).

  Dynamic Extensions on AIX</a></h2>
Starting from Perl 5.7.2 (and consequently 5.8.x / 5.10.x / 5.12.x) and AIX 4.3
  or newer Perl uses the AIX native dynamic loading interface in the so called
  runtime linking mode instead of the emulated interface that was used in Perl
  releases 5.6.1 and earlier or, for AIX releases 4.2 and earlier. This change
  does break backward compatibility with compiled modules from earlier Perl
  releases. The change was made to make Perl more compliant with other
  applications like Apache/mod_perl which are using the AIX native interface.
  This change also enables the use of C++ code with static constructors and
  destructors in Perl extensions, which was not possible using the emulated
  interface.
<p class="Pp">It is highly recommended to use the new interface.</p>

Should yield no problems with AIX 5.1 / 5.2 / 5.3 / 6.1 / 7.1.
<p class="Pp">IBM uses the AIX system Perl (V5.6.0 on AIX 5.1 and V5.8.2 on AIX
    5.2 / 5.3 and 6.1; V5.8.8 on AIX 5.3 TL11 and AIX 6.1 TL4; V5.10.1 on AIX
    7.1) for some AIX system scripts. If you switch the links in /usr/bin from
    the AIX system Perl (/usr/opt/perl5) to the newly build Perl then you get
    the same features as with the IBM AIX system Perl if the threaded options
    are used.</p>
<p class="Pp">The threaded Perl build works also on AIX 5.1 but the IBM Perl
    build (Perl v5.6.0) is not threaded on AIX 5.1.</p>

If your AIX system is installed with 64-bit support, you can expect 64-bit
  configurations to work. If you want to use 64-bit Perl on AIX 6.1 you need an
  APAR for a libc.a bug which affects (n)dbm_XXX functions. The APAR number for
  this problem is IZ39077.
<p class="Pp">If you need more memory (larger data segment) for your Perl
    programs you can set:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>

    /etc/security/limits
    default:                    (or your user)

</pre>
<p class="Pp">With the default setting the size is limited to 128MB. The -1
    removes this limit. If the &quot;make test&quot; fails please change your
    /etc/security/limits as stated above.</p>

Due to the fact that AIX 4.3.3 reached end-of-service in December 31, 2003 this
  information is provided as is. The Perl versions prior to Perl 5.8.9 could be
  compiled on AIX up to 4.3.3 with the following settings (your mileage may
  vary):
<p class="Pp">When compiling Perl, you must use an ANSI C compiler. AIX does not
    ship an ANSI compliant C-compiler with AIX by default, but binary builds of
    gcc for AIX are widely available.</p>
<p class="Pp">At the moment of writing, AIX supports two different native C
    compilers, for which you have to pay: <b>xlC</b> and <b>vac</b>. If you
    decide to use either of these two (which is quite a lot easier than using
    gcc), be sure to upgrade to the latest available patch level. Currently:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    xlC.C     3.1.4.10 or 3.6.6.0 or 4.0.2.2 or 5.0.2.9 or 6.0.0.3
    vac.C     4.4.0.3  or 5.0.2.6 or 6.0.0.1
</pre>
<p class="Pp">note that xlC has the OS version in the name as of version
    4.0.2.0, so you will find xlC.C for AIX-5.0 as package</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    xlC.aix50.rte   5.0.2.0 or 6.0.0.3
</pre>
<p class="Pp">subversions are not the same &quot;latest&quot; on all OS
    versions. For example, the latest xlC-5 on aix41 is 5.0.2.9, while on aix43,
    it is 5.0.2.7.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl can be compiled with either IBM's ANSI C compiler or with
    gcc. The former is recommended, as not only can it compile Perl with no
    difficulty, but also can take advantage of features listed later that
    require the use of IBM compiler-specific command-line flags.</p>
<p class="Pp">The IBM's compiler patch levels 5.0.0.0 and 5.0.1.0 have compiler
    optimization bugs that affect compiling perl.c and regcomp.c, respectively.
    If Perl's configuration detects those compiler patch levels, optimization is
    turned off for the said source code files. Upgrading to at least 5.0.2.0 is
    recommended.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you decide to use gcc, make sure your installation is recent
    and complete, and be sure to read the Perl INSTALL file for more
    gcc-specific details. Please report any hoops you had to jump through to the

Before installing the patches to the IBM C-compiler you need to know the level
  of patching for the Operating System. IBM's command 'oslevel' will show the
  base, but is not always complete (in this example oslevel shows 4.3.NULL,
  whereas the system might run most of 4.3.THREE):

AIX supports dynamically loadable objects as well as shared libraries. Shared
  libraries by convention end with the suffix .a, which is a bit misleading, as
  an archive can contain static as well as dynamic members. For Perl dynamically
  loaded objects we use the .so suffix also used on many other platforms.

    versions will turn up nasty later on. For vac 5 be sure to run at least
    5.0.1.0, but vac 5.0.2.6 or up is highly recommended. Note that since IBM
    has removed vac 5.0.2.1 through 5.0.2.5 from the software depot, these
    versions should be considered obsolete.</p>
<p class="Pp">Here's a brief lead of how to upgrade the compiler to the latest
    level. Of course this is subject to changes. You can only upgrade versions
    from ftp-available updates if the first three digit groups are the same (in
    where you can skip intermediate unlike the patches in the developer
    snapshots of Perl), or to one version up where the &quot;base&quot; is

Threads seem to work OK, though at the moment not all tests pass when threads

<p class="Pp">in the &quot;pp_ghostent&quot; function, you may ignore it safely.
    The warning is caused by the reentrant variant of <i>gethostbyaddr()</i>

    the difference is not really significant here.</p>

  4.2 and extensions using C++ with statics</a></h2>
In AIX 4.2 Perl extensions that use C++ functions that use statics may have
  problems in that the statics are not getting initialized. In newer AIX
  releases this has been solved by linking Perl with the libC_r library, but
  unfortunately in AIX 4.2 the said library has an obscure bug where the various
  functions related to time (such as <i>time()</i> and <i>gettimeofday()</i>)
  return broken values, and therefore in AIX 4.2 Perl is not linked against the
  libC_r.
