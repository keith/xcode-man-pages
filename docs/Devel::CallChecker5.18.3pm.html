   give a nicer C++.  Capital omega is used to do unbreakable dashes and

This module makes some new features of the Perl 5.14.0 C API available to XS
  modules running on older versions of Perl. The features are centred around the
  function <span class="Li">&quot;cv_set_call_checker&quot;</span>, which allows
  XS code to attach a magical annotation to a Perl subroutine, resulting in
  resolvable calls to that subroutine being mutated at compile time by arbitrary
  C code. This module makes
  <span class="Li">&quot;cv_set_call_checker&quot;</span> and several supporting
  functions available. (It is possible to achieve the effect of
  <span class="Li">&quot;cv_set_call_checker&quot;</span> from XS code on much
  earlier Perl versions, but it is painful to achieve without the centralised
  facility.)
<p class="Pp">This module provides the implementation of the functions at
    runtime (on Perls where they are not provided by the core). It also, at
    compile time, supplies the C header file and link library which provide
    access to the functions. In normal use, &quot;callchecker0_h&quot; and
    &quot;callchecker_linkable&quot; should be called at build time (not
    authoring time) for the module that wishes to use the C functions.</p>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>rv2cv_op_cv</dt>
  <dd>Examines an op, which is expected to identify a subroutine at runtime, and
      attempts to determine at compile time which subroutine it identifies. This
      is normally used during Perl compilation to determine whether a prototype
      can be applied to a function call. <i>cvop</i> is the op being considered,
      normally an <span class="Li">&quot;rv2cv&quot;</span> op. A pointer to the
      identified subroutine is returned, if it could be determined statically,
      and a null pointer is returned if it was not possible to determine
      statically.
    <p class="Pp">Whether the subroutine is statically identifiable is
        determined in accordance with the prevailing standards of the Perl
        version being used. The same criteria are used that the core uses to
        determine whether to apply a prototype to a subroutine call. From
        version 5.11.2 onwards, the subroutine can be determined if the RV that
        the <span class="Li">&quot;rv2cv&quot;</span> is to operate on is
        provided by a suitable <span class="Li">&quot;gv&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;const&quot;</span> op. Prior to 5.11.2, only a
        <span class="Li">&quot;gv&quot;</span> op will do. A
        <span class="Li">&quot;gv&quot;</span> op is suitable if the GV's CV
        slot is populated. A <span class="Li">&quot;const&quot;</span> op is
        suitable if the constant value must be an RV pointing to a CV. Details
        of this process may change in future versions of Perl.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If the <span class="Li">&quot;rv2cv&quot;</span> op has the
        <span class="Li">&quot;OPpENTERSUB_AMPER&quot;</span> flag set then no
        attempt is made to identify the subroutine statically: this flag is used
        to suppress compile-time magic on a subroutine call, forcing it to use
        default runtime behaviour.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If <i>flags</i> has the bit
        <span class="Li">&quot;RV2CVOPCV_MARK_EARLY&quot;</span> set, then the
        handling of a GV reference is modified. If a GV was examined and its CV
        slot was found to be empty, then the
        <span class="Li">&quot;gv&quot;</span> op has the
        <span class="Li">&quot;OPpEARLY_CV&quot;</span> flag set. If the op is
        not optimised away, and the CV slot is later populated with a subroutine
        having a prototype, that flag eventually triggers the warning
        &quot;called too early to check prototype&quot;.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If <i>flags</i> has the bit
        <span class="Li">&quot;RV2CVOPCV_RETURN_NAME_GV&quot;</span> set, then
        instead of returning a pointer to the subroutine it returns a pointer to
        the GV giving the most appropriate name for the subroutine in this
        context. Normally this is just the
        <span class="Li">&quot;CvGV&quot;</span> of the subroutine, but for an
        anonymous (<span class="Li">&quot;CvANON&quot;</span>) subroutine that
        is referenced through a GV it will be the referencing GV. The resulting
        <span class="Li">&quot;GV*&quot;</span> is cast to
        <span class="Li">&quot;CV*&quot;</span> to be returned. A null pointer
        is returned as usual if there is no statically-determinable
      subroutine.</p>

  <dd>Retrieves the function that will be used to fix up a call to <i>cv</i>.

        should be used by the check function to refer to the callee of the
        <span class="Li">&quot;entersub&quot;</span> op if it needs to emit any
        diagnostics. It is permitted to apply the check function in non-standard

    <p class="Pp">By default, the function is

  <dd>Performs the fixup of the arguments part of an

      prototype. This makes various modifications to the argument ops, from
      applying context up to inserting
      <span class="Li">&quot;refgen&quot;</span> ops, and checking the number
      and syntactic types of arguments, as directed by the prototype. This is
      the standard treatment used on a subroutine call, not marked with
      <span class="Li">&quot;&amp;&quot;</span>, where the callee can be
      identified at compile time and has a prototype.
    <p class="Pp"><i>protosv</i> supplies the subroutine prototype to be applied
        to the call. It may be a normal defined scalar, of which the string
        value will be used. Alternatively, for convenience, it may be a
        subroutine object (a <span class="Li">&quot;CV*&quot;</span> that has
        been cast to <span class="Li">&quot;SV*&quot;</span>) which has a
        prototype. The prototype supplied, in whichever form, does not need to

    <p class="Pp">If the argument ops disagree with the prototype, for example
        by having an unacceptable number of arguments, a valid op tree is

        all the compilation errors that occurred. In the error message, the
