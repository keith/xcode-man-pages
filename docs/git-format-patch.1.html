<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Prepare each non-merge commit with its &quot;patch&quot; in one
    &quot;message&quot; per commit, formatted to resemble a UNIX mailbox. The
    output of this command is convenient for e-mail submission or for use with
    <i>git am</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">A &quot;message&quot; generated by the command consists of three
    parts:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;A brief metadata header that begins with <b>From
  &lt;commit&gt;</b> with a fixed <b>Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 2001</b> datestamp to
  help programs like &quot;file(1)&quot; to recognize that the file is an output
  from this command, fields that record the author identity, the author date,
  and the title of the change (taken from the first paragraph of the commit log
  message).</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;The second and subsequent paragraphs of the
  commit log message.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;The &quot;patch&quot;, which is the &quot;diff -p
  --stat&quot; output (see <b>git-diff</b>(1)) between the commit and its
  parent.</div>
<p class="Pp">The log message and the patch is separated by a line with a
    three-dash line.</p>
<p class="Pp">There are two ways to specify which commits to operate on.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 1.A single commit, &lt;since&gt;, specifies that the
  commits leading to the tip of the current branch that are not in the history
  that leads to the &lt;since&gt; to be output.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 2.Generic &lt;revision range&gt; expression (see
  &quot;SPECIFYING REVISIONS&quot; section in <b>gitrevisions</b>(7)) means the
  commits in the specified range.</div>
<p class="Pp">The first rule takes precedence in the case of a single
    &lt;commit&gt;. To apply the second rule, i.e., format everything since the
    beginning of history up until &lt;commit&gt;, use the <b>--root</b> option:
    <b>git format-patch --root &lt;commit&gt;</b>. If you want to format only
    &lt;commit&gt; itself, you can do this with <b>git format-patch -1
    &lt;commit&gt;</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">By default, each output file is numbered sequentially from 1, and
    uses the first line of the commit message (massaged for pathname safety) as
    the filename. With the <b>--numbered-files</b> option, the output file names
    will only be numbers, without the first line of the commit appended. The
    names of the output files are printed to standard output, unless the
    <b>--stdout</b> option is specified.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <b>-o</b> is specified, output files are created in
    &lt;dir&gt;. Otherwise they are created in the current working directory.
    The default path can be set with the <b>format.outputDirectory</b>
    configuration option. The <b>-o</b> option takes precedence over
    <b>format.outputDirectory</b>. To store patches in the current working
    directory even when <b>format.outputDirectory</b> points elsewhere, use
    <b>-o .</b>. All directory components will be created.</p>
<p class="Pp">By default, the subject of a single patch is &quot;[PATCH] &quot;
    followed by the concatenation of lines from the commit message up to the
    first blank line (see the DISCUSSION section of <b>git-commit</b>(1)).</p>
<p class="Pp">When multiple patches are output, the subject prefix will instead
    be &quot;[PATCH n/m] &quot;. To force 1/1 to be added for a single patch,
    use <b>-n</b>. To omit patch numbers from the subject, use <b>-N</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">If given <b>--thread</b>, <b>git-format-patch</b> will generate
    <b>In-Reply-To</b> and <b>References</b> headers to make the second and
    subsequent patch mails appear as replies to the first mail; this also
    generates a <b>Message-Id</b> header to reference.</p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">-p, --no-stat</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Generate plain patches without any diffstats.</div>
<p class="Pp">-U&lt;n&gt;, --unified=&lt;n&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Generate diffs with &lt;n&gt; lines of context instead of
  the usual three.</div>
<p class="Pp">--output=&lt;file&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Output to a specific file instead of stdout.</div>
<p class="Pp">--output-indicator-new=&lt;char&gt;,
    --output-indicator-old=&lt;char&gt;,
  --output-indicator-context=&lt;char&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Specify the character used to indicate new, old or
  context lines in the generated patch. Normally they are <i>+</i>, <i>-</i> and
  ' ' respectively.</div>
<p class="Pp">--indent-heuristic</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Enable the heuristic that shifts diff hunk boundaries to
  make patches easier to read. This is the default.</div>
<p class="Pp">--no-indent-heuristic</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Disable the indent heuristic.</div>
<p class="Pp">--minimal</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Spend extra time to make sure the smallest possible diff
  is produced.</div>
<p class="Pp">--patience</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Generate a diff using the &quot;patience diff&quot;
  algorithm.</div>
<p class="Pp">--histogram</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Generate a diff using the &quot;histogram diff&quot;
  algorithm.</div>
<p class="Pp">--anchored=&lt;text&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Generate a diff using the &quot;anchored diff&quot;
  algorithm.
<p class="Pp">This option may be specified more than once.</p>
<p class="Pp">If a line exists in both the source and destination, exists only
    once, and starts with this text, this algorithm attempts to prevent it from
    appearing as a deletion or addition in the output. It uses the
    &quot;patience diff&quot; algorithm internally.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--diff-algorithm={patience|minimal|histogram|myers}</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Choose a diff algorithm. The variants are as follows:
<p class="Pp"><b>default</b>, <b>myers</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The basic greedy diff algorithm. Currently, this is the
  default.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>minimal</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Spend extra time to make sure the smallest possible diff
  is produced.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>patience</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Use &quot;patience diff&quot; algorithm when generating
  patches.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>histogram</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This algorithm extends the patience algorithm to
  &quot;support low-occurrence common elements&quot;.</div>
<p class="Pp">For instance, if you configured the <b>diff.algorithm</b> variable
    to a non-default value and want to use the default one, then you have to use
    <b>--diff-algorithm=default</b> option.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--stat[=&lt;width&gt;[,&lt;name-width&gt;[,&lt;count&gt;]]]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Generate a diffstat. By default, as much space as
  necessary will be used for the filename part, and the rest for the graph part.
  Maximum width defaults to terminal width, or 80 columns if not connected to a
  terminal, and can be overridden by <b>&lt;width&gt;</b>. The width of the
  filename part can be limited by giving another width <b>&lt;name-width&gt;</b>
  after a comma. The width of the graph part can be limited by using
  <b>--stat-graph-width=&lt;width&gt;</b> (affects all commands generating a
  stat graph) or by setting <b>diff.statGraphWidth=&lt;width&gt;</b> (does not
  affect <b>git format-patch</b>). By giving a third parameter
  <b>&lt;count&gt;</b>, you can limit the output to the first
  <b>&lt;count&gt;</b> lines, followed by <b>...</b> if there are more.
<p class="Pp">These parameters can also be set individually with
    <b>--stat-width=&lt;width&gt;</b>,
    <b>--stat-name-width=&lt;name-width&gt;</b> and
    <b>--stat-count=&lt;count&gt;</b>.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--compact-summary</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Output a condensed summary of extended header information
  such as file creations or deletions (&quot;new&quot; or &quot;gone&quot;,
  optionally &quot;+l&quot; if it&#x2019;s a symlink) and mode changes
  (&quot;+x&quot; or &quot;-x&quot; for adding or removing executable bit
  respectively) in diffstat. The information is put between the filename part
  and the graph part. Implies <b>--stat</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--numstat</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Similar to <b>--stat</b>, but shows number of added and
  deleted lines in decimal notation and pathname without abbreviation, to make
  it more machine friendly. For binary files, outputs two <b>-</b> instead of
  saying <b>0 0</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--shortstat</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Output only the last line of the <b>--stat</b> format
  containing total number of modified files, as well as number of added and
  deleted lines.</div>
<p class="Pp">-X[&lt;param1,param2,...&gt;],
    --dirstat[=&lt;param1,param2,...&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Output the distribution of relative amount of changes for
  each sub-directory. The behavior of <b>--dirstat</b> can be customized by
  passing it a comma separated list of parameters. The defaults are controlled
  by the <b>diff.dirstat</b> configuration variable (see <b>git-config</b>(1)).
  The following parameters are available:
<p class="Pp"><b>changes</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Compute the dirstat numbers by counting the lines that
  have been removed from the source, or added to the destination. This ignores
  the amount of pure code movements within a file. In other words, rearranging
  lines in a file is not counted as much as other changes. This is the default
  behavior when no parameter is given.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>lines</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Compute the dirstat numbers by doing the regular
  line-based diff analysis, and summing the removed/added line counts. (For
  binary files, count 64-byte chunks instead, since binary files have no natural
  concept of lines). This is a more expensive <b>--dirstat</b> behavior than the
  <b>changes</b> behavior, but it does count rearranged lines within a file as
  much as other changes. The resulting output is consistent with what you get
  from the other <b>--*stat</b> options.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>files</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Compute the dirstat numbers by counting the number of
  files changed. Each changed file counts equally in the dirstat analysis. This
  is the computationally cheapest <b>--dirstat</b> behavior, since it does not
  have to look at the file contents at all.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>cumulative</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Count changes in a child directory for the parent
  directory as well. Note that when using <b>cumulative</b>, the sum of the
  percentages reported may exceed 100%. The default (non-cumulative) behavior
  can be specified with the <b>noncumulative</b> parameter.</div>
<p class="Pp">&lt;limit&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">An integer parameter specifies a cut-off percent (3% by
  default). Directories contributing less than this percentage of the changes
  are not shown in the output.</div>
<p class="Pp">Example: The following will count changed files, while ignoring
    directories with less than 10% of the total amount of changed files, and
    accumulating child directory counts in the parent directories:
    <b>--dirstat=files,10,cumulative</b>.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--cumulative</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Synonym for --dirstat=cumulative</div>
<p class="Pp">--dirstat-by-file[=&lt;param1,param2&gt;...]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Synonym for --dirstat=files,param1,param2...</div>
<p class="Pp">--summary</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Output a condensed summary of extended header information
  such as creations, renames and mode changes.</div>
<p class="Pp">--no-renames</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Turn off rename detection, even when the configuration
  file gives the default to do so.</div>
<p class="Pp">--[no-]rename-empty</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Whether to use empty blobs as rename source.</div>
<p class="Pp">--full-index</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Instead of the first handful of characters, show the full
  pre- and post-image blob object names on the &quot;index&quot; line when
  generating patch format output.</div>
<p class="Pp">--binary</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">In addition to <b>--full-index</b>, output a binary diff
  that can be applied with <b>git-apply</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--abbrev[=&lt;n&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Instead of showing the full 40-byte hexadecimal object
  name in diff-raw format output and diff-tree header lines, show the shortest
  prefix that is at least <i>&lt;n&gt;</i> hexdigits long that uniquely refers
  the object. In diff-patch output format, <b>--full-index</b> takes higher
  precedence, i.e. if <b>--full-index</b> is specified, full blob names will be
  shown regardless of <b>--abbrev</b>. Non default number of digits can be
  specified with <b>--abbrev=&lt;n&gt;</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">-B[&lt;n&gt;][/&lt;m&gt;],
    --break-rewrites[=[&lt;n&gt;][/&lt;m&gt;]]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Break complete rewrite changes into pairs of delete and
  create. This serves two purposes:
<p class="Pp">It affects the way a change that amounts to a total rewrite of a
    file not as a series of deletion and insertion mixed together with a very
    few lines that happen to match textually as the context, but as a single
    deletion of everything old followed by a single insertion of everything new,
    and the number <b>m</b> controls this aspect of the -B option (defaults to
    60%). <b>-B/70%</b> specifies that less than 30% of the original should
    remain in the result for Git to consider it a total rewrite (i.e. otherwise
    the resulting patch will be a series of deletion and insertion mixed
    together with context lines).</p>
<p class="Pp">When used with -M, a totally-rewritten file is also considered as
    the source of a rename (usually -M only considers a file that disappeared as
    the source of a rename), and the number <b>n</b> controls this aspect of the
    -B option (defaults to 50%). <b>-B20%</b> specifies that a change with
    addition and deletion compared to 20% or more of the file&#x2019;s size are
    eligible for being picked up as a possible source of a rename to another
    file.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">-M[&lt;n&gt;], --find-renames[=&lt;n&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Detect renames. If <b>n</b> is specified, it is a
  threshold on the similarity index (i.e. amount of addition/deletions compared
  to the file&#x2019;s size). For example, <b>-M90%</b> means Git should
  consider a delete/add pair to be a rename if more than 90% of the file
  hasn&#x2019;t changed. Without a <b>%</b> sign, the number is to be read as a
  fraction, with a decimal point before it. I.e., <b>-M5</b> becomes 0.5, and is
  thus the same as <b>-M50%</b>. Similarly, <b>-M05</b> is the same as
  <b>-M5%</b>. To limit detection to exact renames, use <b>-M100%</b>. The
  default similarity index is 50%.</div>
<p class="Pp">-C[&lt;n&gt;], --find-copies[=&lt;n&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Detect copies as well as renames. See also
  <b>--find-copies-harder</b>. If <b>n</b> is specified, it has the same meaning
  as for <b>-M&lt;n&gt;</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--find-copies-harder</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">For performance reasons, by default, <b>-C</b> option
  finds copies only if the original file of the copy was modified in the same
  changeset. This flag makes the command inspect unmodified files as candidates
  for the source of copy. This is a very expensive operation for large projects,
  so use it with caution. Giving more than one <b>-C</b> option has the same
  effect.</div>
<p class="Pp">-D, --irreversible-delete</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Omit the preimage for deletes, i.e. print only the header
  but not the diff between the preimage and <b>/dev/null</b>. The resulting
  patch is not meant to be applied with <b>patch</b> or <b>git apply</b>; this
  is solely for people who want to just concentrate on reviewing the text after
  the change. In addition, the output obviously lacks enough information to
  apply such a patch in reverse, even manually, hence the name of the option.
<p class="Pp">When used together with <b>-B</b>, omit also the preimage in the
    deletion part of a delete/create pair.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">-l&lt;num&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The <b>-M</b> and <b>-C</b> options involve some
  preliminary steps that can detect subsets of renames/copies cheaply, followed
  by an exhaustive fallback portion that compares all remaining unpaired
  destinations to all relevant sources. (For renames, only remaining unpaired
  sources are relevant; for copies, all original sources are relevant.) For N
  sources and destinations, this exhaustive check is O(N^2). This option
  prevents the exhaustive portion of rename/copy detection from running if the
  number of source/destination files involved exceeds the specified number.
  Defaults to diff.renameLimit. Note that a value of 0 is treated as
  unlimited.</div>
<p class="Pp">-O&lt;orderfile&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Control the order in which files appear in the output.
  This overrides the <b>diff.orderFile</b> configuration variable (see
  <b>git-config</b>(1)). To cancel <b>diff.orderFile</b>, use
  <b>-O/dev/null</b>.
<p class="Pp">The output order is determined by the order of glob patterns in
    &lt;orderfile&gt;. All files with pathnames that match the first pattern are
    output first, all files with pathnames that match the second pattern (but
    not the first) are output next, and so on. All files with pathnames that do
    not match any pattern are output last, as if there was an implicit match-all
    pattern at the end of the file. If multiple pathnames have the same rank
    (they match the same pattern but no earlier patterns), their output order
    relative to each other is the normal order.</p>
<p class="Pp">&lt;orderfile&gt; is parsed as follows:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Blank lines are ignored, so they can be used as
  separators for readability.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Lines starting with a hash (&quot;<b>#</b>&quot;)
  are ignored, so they can be used for comments. Add a backslash
  (&quot;<b>\</b>&quot;) to the beginning of the pattern if it starts with a
  hash.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Each other line contains a single pattern.</div>
<p class="Pp">Patterns have the same syntax and semantics as patterns used for
    fnmatch(3) without the FNM_PATHNAME flag, except a pathname also matches a
    pattern if removing any number of the final pathname components matches the
    pattern. For example, the pattern &quot;<b>foo*bar</b>&quot; matches
    &quot;<b>fooasdfbar</b>&quot; and &quot;<b>foo/bar/baz/asdf</b>&quot; but
    not &quot;<b>foobarx</b>&quot;.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--skip-to=&lt;file&gt;, --rotate-to=&lt;file&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Discard the files before the named &lt;file&gt; from the
  output (i.e. <i>skip to</i>), or move them to the end of the output (i.e.
  <i>rotate to</i>). These were invented primarily for use of the <b>git
  difftool</b> command, and may not be very useful otherwise.</div>
<p class="Pp">--relative[=&lt;path&gt;], --no-relative</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When run from a subdirectory of the project, it can be
  told to exclude changes outside the directory and show pathnames relative to
  it with this option. When you are not in a subdirectory (e.g. in a bare
  repository), you can name which subdirectory to make the output relative to by
  giving a &lt;path&gt; as an argument. <b>--no-relative</b> can be used to
  countermand both <b>diff.relative</b> config option and previous
  <b>--relative</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">-a, --text</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Treat all files as text.</div>
<p class="Pp">--ignore-cr-at-eol</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Ignore carriage-return at the end of line when doing a
  comparison.</div>
<p class="Pp">--ignore-space-at-eol</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Ignore changes in whitespace at EOL.</div>
<p class="Pp">-b, --ignore-space-change</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Ignore changes in amount of whitespace. This ignores
  whitespace at line end, and considers all other sequences of one or more
  whitespace characters to be equivalent.</div>
<p class="Pp">-w, --ignore-all-space</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Ignore whitespace when comparing lines. This ignores
  differences even if one line has whitespace where the other line has
  none.</div>
<p class="Pp">--ignore-blank-lines</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Ignore changes whose lines are all blank.</div>
<p class="Pp">-I&lt;regex&gt;, --ignore-matching-lines=&lt;regex&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Ignore changes whose all lines match &lt;regex&gt;. This
  option may be specified more than once.</div>
<p class="Pp">--inter-hunk-context=&lt;lines&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show the context between diff hunks, up to the specified
  number of lines, thereby fusing hunks that are close to each other. Defaults
  to <b>diff.interHunkContext</b> or 0 if the config option is unset.</div>
<p class="Pp">-W, --function-context</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show whole function as context lines for each change. The
  function names are determined in the same way as <b>git diff</b> works out
  patch hunk headers (see <i>Defining a custom hunk-header</i> in
  <b>gitattributes</b>(5)).</div>
<p class="Pp">--ext-diff</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Allow an external diff helper to be executed. If you set
  an external diff driver with <b>gitattributes</b>(5), you need to use this
  option with <b>git-log</b>(1) and friends.</div>
<p class="Pp">--no-ext-diff</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Disallow external diff drivers.</div>
<p class="Pp">--textconv, --no-textconv</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Allow (or disallow) external text conversion filters to
  be run when comparing binary files. See <b>gitattributes</b>(5) for details.
  Because textconv filters are typically a one-way conversion, the resulting
  diff is suitable for human consumption, but cannot be applied. For this
  reason, textconv filters are enabled by default only for <b>git-diff</b>(1)
  and <b>git-log</b>(1), but not for <b>git-format-patch</b>(1) or diff plumbing
  commands.</div>
<p class="Pp">--ignore-submodules[=&lt;when&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Ignore changes to submodules in the diff generation.
  &lt;when&gt; can be either &quot;none&quot;, &quot;untracked&quot;,
  &quot;dirty&quot; or &quot;all&quot;, which is the default. Using
  &quot;none&quot; will consider the submodule modified when it either contains
  untracked or modified files or its HEAD differs from the commit recorded in
  the superproject and can be used to override any settings of the <i>ignore</i>
  option in <b>git-config</b>(1) or <b>gitmodules</b>(5). When
  &quot;untracked&quot; is used submodules are not considered dirty when they
  only contain untracked content (but they are still scanned for modified
  content). Using &quot;dirty&quot; ignores all changes to the work tree of
  submodules, only changes to the commits stored in the superproject are shown
  (this was the behavior until 1.7.0). Using &quot;all&quot; hides all changes
  to submodules.</div>
<p class="Pp">--src-prefix=&lt;prefix&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show the given source prefix instead of
  &quot;a/&quot;.</div>
<p class="Pp">--dst-prefix=&lt;prefix&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show the given destination prefix instead of
  &quot;b/&quot;.</div>
<p class="Pp">--no-prefix</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Do not show any source or destination prefix.</div>
<p class="Pp">--line-prefix=&lt;prefix&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Prepend an additional prefix to every line of
  output.</div>
<p class="Pp">--ita-invisible-in-index</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">By default entries added by &quot;git add -N&quot; appear
  as an existing empty file in &quot;git diff&quot; and a new file in &quot;git
  diff --cached&quot;. This option makes the entry appear as a new file in
  &quot;git diff&quot; and non-existent in &quot;git diff --cached&quot;. This
  option could be reverted with <b>--ita-visible-in-index</b>. Both options are
  experimental and could be removed in future.</div>
<p class="Pp">For more detailed explanation on these common options, see also
    <b>gitdiffcore</b>(7).</p>
<p class="Pp">-&lt;n&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Prepare patches from the topmost &lt;n&gt; commits.</div>
<p class="Pp">-o &lt;dir&gt;, --output-directory &lt;dir&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Use &lt;dir&gt; to store the resulting files, instead of
  the current working directory.</div>
<p class="Pp">-n, --numbered</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Name output in <i>[PATCH n/m]</i> format, even with a

<p class="Pp">-N, --no-numbered</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Name output in <i>[PATCH]</i> format.</div>
<p class="Pp">--start-number &lt;n&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Start numbering the patches at &lt;n&gt; instead of
  1.</div>
<p class="Pp">--numbered-files</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Output file names will be a simple number sequence
  without the default first line of the commit appended.</div>
<p class="Pp">-k, --keep-subject</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Do not strip/add <i>[PATCH]</i> from the first line of
  the commit log message.</div>
<p class="Pp">-s, --signoff</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Add a <b>Signed-off-by</b> trailer to the commit message,
  using the committer identity of yourself. See the signoff option in
  <b>git-commit</b>(1) for more information.</div>
<p class="Pp">--stdout</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Print all commits to the standard output in mbox format,
  instead of creating a file for each one.</div>
<p class="Pp">--attach[=&lt;boundary&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Create multipart/mixed attachment, the first part of
  which is the commit message and the patch itself in the second part, with
  <b>Content-Disposition: attachment</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--no-attach</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Disable the creation of an attachment, overriding the
  configuration setting.</div>
<p class="Pp">--inline[=&lt;boundary&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Create multipart/mixed attachment, the first part of
  which is the commit message and the patch itself in the second part, with
  <b>Content-Disposition: inline</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--thread[=&lt;style&gt;], --no-thread</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Controls addition of <b>In-Reply-To</b> and
  <b>References</b> headers to make the second and subsequent mails appear as
  replies to the first. Also controls generation of the <b>Message-Id</b> header
  to reference.
<p class="Pp">The optional &lt;style&gt; argument can be either <b>shallow</b>
    or <b>deep</b>. <i>shallow</i> threading makes every mail a reply to the
    head of the series, where the head is chosen from the cover letter, the
    <b>--in-reply-to</b>, and the first patch mail, in this order. <i>deep</i>
    threading makes every mail a reply to the previous one.</p>
<p class="Pp">The default is <b>--no-thread</b>, unless the <b>format.thread</b>
    configuration is set. If <b>--thread</b> is specified without a style, it
    defaults to the style specified by <b>format.thread</b> if any, or else
    <b>shallow</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Beware that the default for <i>git send-email</i> is to thread
    emails itself. If you want <b>git format-patch</b> to take care of
    threading, you will want to ensure that threading is disabled for <b>git
    send-email</b>.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--in-reply-to=&lt;message id&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Make the first mail (or all the mails with
  <b>--no-thread</b>) appear as a reply to the given &lt;message id&gt;, which
  avoids breaking threads to provide a new patch series.</div>
<p class="Pp">--ignore-if-in-upstream</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Do not include a patch that matches a commit in
  &lt;until&gt;..&lt;since&gt;. This will examine all patches reachable from
  &lt;since&gt; but not from &lt;until&gt; and compare them with the patches
  being generated, and any patch that matches is ignored.</div>
<p class="Pp">--always</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Include patches for commits that do not introduce any
  change, which are omitted by default.</div>
<p class="Pp">--cover-from-description=&lt;mode&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Controls which parts of the cover letter will be
  automatically populated using the branch&#x2019;s description.
<p class="Pp">If <b>&lt;mode&gt;</b> is <b>message</b> or <b>default</b>, the
    cover letter subject will be populated with placeholder text. The body of
    the cover letter will be populated with the branch&#x2019;s description.
    This is the default mode when no configuration nor command line option is
    specified.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <b>&lt;mode&gt;</b> is <b>subject</b>, the first paragraph of
    the branch description will populate the cover letter subject. The remainder
    of the description will populate the body of the cover letter.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <b>&lt;mode&gt;</b> is <b>auto</b>, if the first paragraph of
    the branch description is greater than 100 bytes, then the mode will be
    <b>message</b>, otherwise <b>subject</b> will be used.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <b>&lt;mode&gt;</b> is <b>none</b>, both the cover letter
    subject and body will be populated with placeholder text.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--subject-prefix=&lt;subject prefix&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Instead of the standard <i>[PATCH]</i> prefix in the
  subject line, instead use <i>[&lt;subject prefix&gt;]</i>. This allows for
  useful naming of a patch series, and can be combined with the
  <b>--numbered</b> option.</div>
<p class="Pp">--filename-max-length=&lt;n&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Instead of the standard 64 bytes, chomp the generated
  output filenames at around <i>&lt;n&gt;</i> bytes (too short a value will be
  silently raised to a reasonable length). Defaults to the value of the
  <b>format.filenameMaxLength</b> configuration variable, or 64 if
  unconfigured.</div>
<p class="Pp">--rfc</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Alias for <b>--subject-prefix=&quot;RFC PATCH&quot;</b>.
  RFC means &quot;Request For Comments&quot;; use this when sending an
  experimental patch for discussion rather than application.</div>
<p class="Pp">-v &lt;n&gt;, --reroll-count=&lt;n&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Mark the series as the &lt;n&gt;-th iteration of the
  topic. The output filenames have <b>v&lt;n&gt;</b> prepended to them, and the
  subject prefix (&quot;PATCH&quot; by default, but configurable via the
  <b>--subject-prefix</b> option) has ` v&lt;n&gt;` appended to it. E.g.
  <b>--reroll-count=4</b> may produce <b>v4-0001-add-makefile.patch</b> file
  that has &quot;Subject: [PATCH v4 1/20] Add makefile&quot; in it.
  <b>&lt;n&gt;</b> does not have to be an integer (e.g.
  &quot;--reroll-count=4.4&quot;, or &quot;--reroll-count=4rev2&quot; are
  allowed), but the downside of using such a reroll-count is that the
  range-diff/interdiff with the previous version does not state exactly which
  version the new interation is compared against.</div>
<p class="Pp">--to=&lt;email&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Add a <b>To:</b> header to the email headers. This is in
  addition to any configured headers, and may be used multiple times. The
  negated form <b>--no-to</b> discards all <b>To:</b> headers added so far (from
  config or command line).</div>
<p class="Pp">--cc=&lt;email&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Add a <b>Cc:</b> header to the email headers. This is in
  addition to any configured headers, and may be used multiple times. The
  negated form <b>--no-cc</b> discards all <b>Cc:</b> headers added so far (from
  config or command line).</div>
<p class="Pp">--from, --from=&lt;ident&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Use <b>ident</b> in the <b>From:</b> header of each
  commit email. If the author ident of the commit is not textually identical to
  the provided <b>ident</b>, place a <b>From:</b> header in the body of the
  message with the original author. If no <b>ident</b> is given, use the
  committer ident.
<p class="Pp">Note that this option is only useful if you are actually sending
    the emails and want to identify yourself as the sender, but retain the
    original author (and <b>git am</b> will correctly pick up the in-body
    header). Note also that <b>git send-email</b> already handles this
    transformation for you, and this option should not be used if you are
    feeding the result to <b>git send-email</b>.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--[no-]force-in-body-from</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">With the e-mail sender specified via the <b>--from</b>
  option, by default, an in-body &quot;From:&quot; to identify the real author
  of the commit is added at the top of the commit log message if the sender is
  different from the author. With this option, the in-body &quot;From:&quot; is
  added even when the sender and the author have the same name and address,
  which may help if the mailing list software mangles the sender&#x2019;s
  identity. Defaults to the value of the <b>format.forceInBodyFrom</b>
  configuration variable.</div>
<p class="Pp">--add-header=&lt;header&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Add an arbitrary header to the email headers. This is in
  addition to any configured headers, and may be used multiple times. For
  example, <b>--add-header=&quot;Organization: git-foo&quot;</b>. The negated
  form <b>--no-add-header</b> discards <b>all</b> (<b>To:</b>, <b>Cc:</b>, and
  custom) headers added so far from config or command line.</div>
<p class="Pp">--[no-]cover-letter</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">In addition to the patches, generate a cover letter file
  containing the branch description, shortlog and the overall diffstat. You can
  fill in a description in the file before sending it out.</div>
<p class="Pp">--encode-email-headers, --no-encode-email-headers</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Encode email headers that have non-ASCII characters with
  &quot;Q-encoding&quot; (described in RFC 2047), instead of outputting the
  headers verbatim. Defaults to the value of the
  <b>format.encodeEmailHeaders</b> configuration variable.</div>
<p class="Pp">--interdiff=&lt;previous&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">As a reviewer aid, insert an interdiff into the cover
  letter, or as commentary of the lone patch of a 1-patch series, showing the
  differences between the previous version of the patch series and the series
  currently being formatted. <b>previous</b> is a single revision naming the tip
  of the previous series which shares a common base with the series being
  formatted (for example <b>git format-patch --cover-letter
  --interdiff=feature/v1 -3 feature/v2</b>).</div>
<p class="Pp">--range-diff=&lt;previous&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">As a reviewer aid, insert a range-diff (see
  <b>git-range-diff</b>(1)) into the cover letter, or as commentary of the lone
  patch of a 1-patch series, showing the differences between the previous
  version of the patch series and the series currently being formatted.
  <b>previous</b> can be a single revision naming the tip of the previous series
  if it shares a common base with the series being formatted (for example <b>git
  format-patch --cover-letter --range-diff=feature/v1 -3 feature/v2</b>), or a
  revision range if the two versions of the series are disjoint (for example
  <b>git format-patch --cover-letter --range-diff=feature/v1~3..feature/v1 -3
  feature/v2</b>).
<p class="Pp">Note that diff options passed to the command affect how the
    primary product of <b>format-patch</b> is generated, and they are not passed
    to the underlying <b>range-diff</b> machinery used to generate the
    cover-letter material (this may change in the future).</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--creation-factor=&lt;percent&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Used with <b>--range-diff</b>, tweak the heuristic which
  matches up commits between the previous and current series of patches by
  adjusting the creation/deletion cost fudge factor. See
  <b>git-range-diff</b>(1)) for details.</div>
<p class="Pp">--notes[=&lt;ref&gt;], --no-notes</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Append the notes (see <b>git-notes</b>(1)) for the commit
  after the three-dash line.
<p class="Pp">The expected use case of this is to write supporting explanation
    for the commit that does not belong to the commit log message proper, and
    include it with the patch submission. While one can simply write these
    explanations after <b>format-patch</b> has run but before sending, keeping
    them as Git notes allows them to be maintained between versions of the patch
    series (but see the discussion of the <b>notes.rewrite</b> configuration
    options in <b>git-notes</b>(1) to use this workflow).</p>
<p class="Pp">The default is <b>--no-notes</b>, unless the <b>format.notes</b>
    configuration is set.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--[no-]signature=&lt;signature&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Add a signature to each message produced. Per RFC 3676
  the signature is separated from the body by a line with '-- ' on it. If the
  signature option is omitted the signature defaults to the Git version
  number.</div>
<p class="Pp">--signature-file=&lt;file&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Works just like --signature except the signature is read
  from a file.</div>
<p class="Pp">--suffix=.&lt;sfx&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Instead of using <b>.patch</b> as the suffix for
  generated filenames, use specified suffix. A common alternative is
  <b>--suffix=.txt</b>. Leaving this empty will remove the <b>.patch</b> suffix.
<p class="Pp">Note that the leading character does not have to be a dot; for
    example, you can use <b>--suffix=-patch</b> to get
    <b>0001-description-of-my-change-patch</b>.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">-q, --quiet</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Do not print the names of the generated files to standard
  output.</div>
<p class="Pp">--no-binary</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Do not output contents of changes in binary files,
  instead display a notice that those files changed. Patches generated using
  this option cannot be applied properly, but they are still useful for code
  review.</div>
<p class="Pp">--zero-commit</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Output an all-zero hash in each patch&#x2019;s From
  header instead of the hash of the commit.</div>
<p class="Pp">--[no-]base[=&lt;commit&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Record the base tree information to identify the state
  the patch series applies to. See the BASE TREE INFORMATION section below for
  details. If &lt;commit&gt; is &quot;auto&quot;, a base commit is automatically
  chosen. The <b>--no-base</b> option overrides a <b>format.useAutoBase</b>
  configuration.</div>
<p class="Pp">--root</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Treat the revision argument as a &lt;revision range&gt;,
  even if it is just a single commit (that would normally be treated as a
  &lt;since&gt;). Note that root commits included in the specified range are
  always formatted as creation patches, independently of this flag.</div>
<p class="Pp">--progress</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show progress reports on stderr as patches are
  generated.</div>

<p class="Pp">Typically it will be placed in a MUA&#x2019;s drafts folder,
    edited to add timely commentary that should not go in the changelog after
    the three dashes, and then sent as a message whose body, in our example,
    starts with &quot;arch/arm config files were...&quot;. On the receiving end,
    readers can save interesting patches in a UNIX mailbox and apply them with
    <b>git-am</b>(1).</p>
<p class="Pp">When a patch is part of an ongoing discussion, the patch generated
    by <i>git format-patch</i> can be tweaked to take advantage of the <i>git am
    --scissors</i> feature. After your response to the discussion comes a line
    that consists solely of &quot;<b>-- &gt;8 --</b>&quot; (scissors and
    perforation), followed by the patch with unnecessary header fields
  removed:</p>

<p class="Pp">When sending a patch this way, most often you are sending your own

    marker you should omit <b>From:</b> and <b>Date:</b> lines from the patch
    file. The patch title is likely to be different from the subject of the
    discussion the patch is in response to, so it is likely that you would want
    to keep the Subject: line, like the example above.</p>

  for patch corruption</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Many mailers if not set up properly will corrupt whitespace. Here
    are two common types of corruption:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Empty context lines that do not have <i>any</i>
  whitespace.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Non-empty context lines that have one extra
  whitespace at the beginning.</div>
<p class="Pp">One way to test if your MUA is set up correctly is:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Send the patch to yourself, exactly the way you
  would, except with To: and Cc: lines that do not contain the list and
  maintainer address.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Save that patch to a file in UNIX mailbox format.
  Call it a.patch, say.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Apply it:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ git fetch &lt;project&gt; master:test-apply
$ git switch test-apply
$ git restore --source=HEAD --staged --worktree :/

</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp">If it does not apply correctly, there can be various reasons.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;The patch itself does not apply cleanly. That is
  <i>bad</i> but does not have much to do with your MUA. You might want to
  rebase the patch with <b>git-rebase</b>(1) before regenerating it in this
  case.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;The MUA corrupted your patch; &quot;am&quot;
  would complain that the patch does not apply. Look in the .git/rebase-apply/
  subdirectory and see what <i>patch</i> file contains and check for the common
  corruption patterns mentioned above.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;While at it, check the <i>info</i> and
  <i>final-commit</i> files as well. If what is in <i>final-commit</i> is not
  exactly what you would want to see in the commit log message, it is very
  likely that the receiver would end up hand editing the log message when
  applying your patch. Things like &quot;Hi, this is my first patch.\n&quot; in
  the patch e-mail should come after the three-dash line that signals the end of

    using various mailers.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="GMail"><a class="permalink" href="#GMail">GMail</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">GMail does not have any way to turn off line wrapping in the web
    interface, so it will mangle any emails that you send. You can however use
    &quot;git send-email&quot; and send your patches through the GMail SMTP
    server, or use any IMAP email client to connect to the google IMAP server
    and forward the emails through that.</p>
<p class="Pp">For hints on using <i>git send-email</i> to send your patches
    through the GMail SMTP server, see the EXAMPLE section of
    <b>git-send-email</b>(1).</p>
<p class="Pp">For hints on submission using the IMAP interface, see the EXAMPLE
    section of <b>git-imap-send</b>(1).</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Thunderbird"><a class="permalink" href="#Thunderbird">Thunderbird</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">By default, Thunderbird will both wrap emails as well as flag them
    as being <i>format=flowed</i>, both of which will make the resulting email
    unusable by Git.</p>
<p class="Pp">There are three different approaches: use an add-on to turn off
    line wraps, configure Thunderbird to not mangle patches, or use an external
    editor to keep Thunderbird from mangling the patches.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Approach #1 (add-on)</b>
  <br/>
</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">Install the Toggle Word Wrap add-on that is available from
    <b>https://addons.mozilla.org/thunderbird/addon/toggle-word-wrap/</b> It
    adds a menu entry &quot;Enable Word Wrap&quot; in the composer&#x2019;s
    &quot;Options&quot; menu that you can tick off. Now you can compose the
    message as you otherwise do (cut + paste, <i>git format-patch</i> | <i>git
    imap-send</i>, etc), but you have to insert line breaks manually in any text
    that you type.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>Approach #2 (configuration)</b>
  <br/>
</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">Three steps:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 1.Configure your mail server composition as plain text:
  Edit...Account Settings...Composition &amp; Addressing, uncheck &quot;Compose
  Messages in HTML&quot;.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 2.Configure your general composition window to not wrap.
<p class="Pp">In Thunderbird 2: Edit..Preferences..Composition, wrap plain text
    messages at 0</p>
<p class="Pp">In Thunderbird 3: Edit..Preferences..Advanced..Config Editor.
    Search for &quot;mail.wrap_long_lines&quot;. Toggle it to make sure it is
    set to <b>false</b>. Also, search for &quot;mailnews.wraplength&quot; and
    set the value to 0.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 3.Disable the use of format=flowed:
  Edit..Preferences..Advanced..Config Editor. Search for
  &quot;mailnews.send_plaintext_flowed&quot;. Toggle it to make sure it is set
  to <b>false</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">After that is done, you should be able to compose email as you
    otherwise would (cut + paste, <i>git format-patch</i> | <i>git
    imap-send</i>, etc), and the patches will not be mangled.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>Approach #3 (external editor)</b>
  <br/>
</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">The following Thunderbird extensions are needed: AboutConfig from
    <b>http://aboutconfig.mozdev.org/</b> and External Editor from
    <b>http://globs.org/articles.php?lng=en&amp;pg=8</b></p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 1.Prepare the patch as a text file using your method of
  choice.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 2.Before opening a compose window, use
  Edit&#x2192;Account Settings to uncheck the &quot;Compose messages in HTML
  format&quot; setting in the &quot;Composition &amp; Addressing&quot; panel of
  the account to be used to send the patch.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 3.In the main Thunderbird window, <i>before</i> you open
  the compose window for the patch, use Tools&#x2192;about:config to set the
  following to the indicated values:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<br/>
        mailnews.send_plaintext_flowed  =&gt; false
<br/>
        mailnews.wraplength             =&gt; 0</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 4.Open a compose window and click the external editor
  icon.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 5.In the external editor window, read in the patch file
  and exit the editor normally.</div>
<p class="Pp">Side note: it may be possible to do step 2 with about:config and
    the following settings but no one&#x2019;s tried yet.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<br/>
        mail.html_compose                       =&gt; false
<br/>
        mail.identity.default.compose_html      =&gt; false
<br/>
        mail.identity.id?.compose_html          =&gt; false</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">There is a script in contrib/thunderbird-patch-inline which can
    help you include patches with Thunderbird in an easy way. To use it, do the
    steps above and then use the script as the external editor.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="KMail"><a class="permalink" href="#KMail">KMail</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">This should help you to submit patches inline using KMail.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 1.Prepare the patch as a text file.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 2.Click on New Mail.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 3.Go under &quot;Options&quot; in the Composer window
  and be sure that &quot;Word wrap&quot; is not set.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 4.Use Message &#x2192; Insert file... and insert the
  patch.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 5.Back in the compose window: add whatever other text
  you wish to the message, complete the addressing and subject fields, and press
  send.</div>

<h1 class="Sh" id="BASE_TREE_INFORMATION"><a class="permalink" href="#BASE_TREE_INFORMATION">BASE
  TREE INFORMATION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The base tree information block is used for maintainers or third
    party testers to know the exact state the patch series applies to. It
    consists of the <i>base commit</i>, which is a well-known commit that is
    part of the stable part of the project history everybody else works off of,
    and zero or more <i>prerequisite patches</i>, which are well-known patches
    in flight that is not yet part of the <i>base commit</i> that need to be
    applied on top of <i>base commit</i> in topological order before the patches
    can be applied.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>base commit</i> is shown as &quot;base-commit: &quot;
    followed by the 40-hex of the commit object name. A <i>prerequisite
    patch</i> is shown as &quot;prerequisite-patch-id: &quot; followed by the
    40-hex <i>patch id</i>, which can be obtained by passing the patch through
    the <b>git patch-id --stable</b> command.</p>
<p class="Pp">Imagine that on top of the public commit P, you applied well-known
    patches X, Y and Z from somebody else, and then built your three-patch
    series A, B, C, the history would be like:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>---P---X---Y---Z---A---B---C</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">With <b>git format-patch --base=P -3 C</b> (or variants thereof,
    e.g. with <b>--cover-letter</b> or using <b>Z..C</b> instead of <b>-3 C</b>
    to specify the range), the base tree information block is shown at the end
    of the first message the command outputs (either the first patch, or the
    cover letter), like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>base-commit: P
prerequisite-patch-id: X
prerequisite-patch-id: Y
prerequisite-patch-id: Z</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">For non-linear topology, such as</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>---P---X---A---M---C
<br/>
    \         /
<br/>
     Y---Z---B</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">You can also use <b>git format-patch --base=P -3 C</b> to generate
    patches for A, B and C, and the identifiers for P, X, Y, Z are appended at
    the end of the first message.</p>
<p class="Pp">If set <b>--base=auto</b> in cmdline, it will automatically
    compute the base commit as the merge base of tip commit of the
    remote-tracking branch and revision-range specified in cmdline. For a local
    branch, you need to make it to track a remote branch by <b>git branch
    --set-upstream-to</b> before using this option.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="EXAMPLES"><a class="permalink" href="#EXAMPLES">EXAMPLES</a></h1>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Extract commits between revisions R1 and R2, and
  apply them on top of the current branch using <i>git am</i> to cherry-pick
  them:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ git format-patch -k --stdout R1..R2 | git am -3 -k</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Extract all commits which are in the current
  branch but not in the origin branch:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ git format-patch origin</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">For each commit a separate file is created in the current
    directory.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Extract all commits that lead to <i>origin</i>
  since the inception of the project:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ git format-patch --root origin</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;The same as the previous one:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ git format-patch -M -B origin</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Additionally, it detects and handles renames and complete rewrites
    intelligently to produce a renaming patch. A renaming patch reduces the
    amount of text output, and generally makes it easier to review. Note that
    non-Git &quot;patch&quot; programs won&#x2019;t understand renaming patches,
    so use it only when you know the recipient uses Git to apply your patch.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Extract three topmost commits from the current
  branch and format them as e-mailable patches:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ git format-patch -3</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="CAVEATS"><a class="permalink" href="#CAVEATS">CAVEATS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Note that <b>format-patch</b> will omit merge commits from the
    output, even if they are part of the requested range. A simple
    &quot;patch&quot; does not include enough information for the receiving end
    to reproduce the same merge commit.</p>
