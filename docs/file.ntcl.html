   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

  	# BS - start boxed text
  	# ^y = starting y location
  	# ^b = 1
  	# BE - end boxed text (draw box now)
  	Draw four-sided box normally, but don't draw top of
  	box if the box started on an earlier page.
  	# VS - start vertical sidebar
  	# ^Y = starting y location
  	# ^v = 1 (for troff;  for nroff this doesn't matter)
  	# VE - end of vertical sidebar

This command provides several operations on a file's name or attributes.
  <i>Name</i> is the name of a file; if it starts with a tilde, then tilde
  substitution is done before executing the command (see the manual entry for
  <b>filename</b> for details). <i>Option</i> indicates what to do with the file
  name. Any unique abbreviation for <i>option</i> is acceptable. The valid
  options are:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>file atime </b><i>name</i> ?<b>time</b>?</dt>
  <dd>Returns a decimal string giving the time at which file <i>name</i> was
      last accessed. If <i>time</i> is specified, it is an access time to set
      for the file. The time is measured in the standard POSIX fashion as
      seconds from a fixed starting time (often January 1, 1970). If the file
      does not exist or its access time cannot be queried or set then an error
      is generated. On Windows, FAT file systems do not support access
    time.</dd>
  <dt><b>file attributes </b><i>name</i></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>file attributes </b><i>name</i> ?<b>option</b>?</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>file attributes </b><i>name</i> ?<b>option value option
    value...</b>?</dt>
  <dd>This subcommand returns or sets platform specific values associated with a
      file. The first form returns a list of the platform specific flags and
      their values. The second form returns the value for the specific option.
      The third form sets one or more of the values. The values are as
    follows:</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">On Unix, <b>-group</b> gets or sets the group name for the file. A
    group id can be given to the command, but it returns a group name.
    <b>-owner</b> gets or sets the user name of the owner of the file. The
    command returns the owner name, but the numerical id can be passed when
    setting the owner. <b>-permissions</b> sets or retrieves the octal code that
    chmod(1) uses. This command does also has limited support for setting using
    the symbolic attributes for chmod(1), of the form
    [ugo]?[[+-=][rwxst],[...]], where multiple symbolic attributes can be
    separated by commas (example: <b>u+s,go-rw</b> add sticky bit for user,
    remove read and write permissions for group and other). A simplified
    <b>ls</b> style string, of the form rwxrwxrwx (must be 9 characters), is
    also supported (example: <b>rwxr-xr-t</b> is equivalent to 01755). On
    versions of Unix supporting file flags, <b>-readonly</b> gives the value or
    sets or clears the readonly attribute of the file, i.e. the user immutable
    flag <b>uchg</b> to chflags(1).</p>
<p class="Pp">On Windows, <b>-archive</b> gives the value or sets or clears the
    archive attribute of the file. <b>-hidden</b> gives the value or sets or
    clears the hidden attribute of the file. <b>-longname</b> will expand each
    path element to its long version. This attribute cannot be set.
    <b>-readonly</b> gives the value or sets or clears the readonly attribute of
    the file. <b>-shortname</b> gives a string where every path element is
    replaced with its short (8.3) version of the name. This attribute cannot be
    set. <b>-system</b> gives or sets or clears the value of the system
    attribute of the file.</p>
<p class="Pp">On Mac OS X and Darwin, <b>-creator</b> gives or sets the Finder
    creator type of the file. <b>-hidden</b> gives or sets or clears the hidden
    attribute of the file. <b>-readonly</b> gives or sets or clears the readonly
    attribute of the file. <b>-rsrclength</b> gives the length of the resource
    fork of the file, this attribute can only be set to the value 0, which
    results in the resource fork being stripped off the file.</p>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>file channels ?</b><i>pattern</i>?</dt>
  <dd>If <i>pattern</i> is not specified, returns a list of names of all
      registered open channels in this interpreter. If <i>pattern</i> is
      specified, only those names matching <i>pattern</i> are returned. Matching
      is determined using the same rules as for <b>string match</b>.</dd>
  <dt><b>file copy </b>?<b>-force</b>? ?<b>--</b>? <i>source</i>
    <i>target</i></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>file copy </b>?<b>-force</b>? ?<b>--</b>? <i>source</i> ?<i>source</i>
    ...? <i>targetDir</i></dt>
  <dd>The first form makes a copy of the file or directory <i>source</i> under
      the pathname <i>target</i>. If <i>target</i> is an existing directory,
      then the second form is used. The second form makes a copy inside
      <i>targetDir</i> of each <i>source</i> file listed. If a directory is
      specified as a <i>source</i>, then the contents of the directory will be
      recursively copied into <i>targetDir</i>. Existing files will not be
      overwritten unless the <b>-force</b> option is specified (when Tcl will
      also attempt to adjust permissions on the destination file or directory if
      that is necessary to allow the copy to proceed). When copying within a
      single filesystem, <i>file copy</i> will copy soft links (i.e. the links
      themselves are copied, not the things they point to). Trying to overwrite
      a non-empty directory, overwrite a directory with a file, or overwrite a
      file with a directory will all result in errors even if <i>-force</i> was
      specified. Arguments are processed in the order specified, halting at the
      first error, if any. A <b>--</b> marks the end of switches; the argument
      following the <b>--</b> will be treated as a <i>source</i> even if it
      starts with a <b>-</b>.</dd>
  <dt><b>file delete </b>?<b>-force</b>? ?<b>--</b>? <i>pathname</i>
    ?<i>pathname</i> ... ?</dt>
  <dd>Removes the file or directory specified by each <i>pathname</i> argument.
      Non-empty directories will be removed only if the <b>-force</b> option is
      specified. When operating on symbolic links, the links themselves will be
      deleted, not the objects they point to. Trying to delete a non-existent
      file is not considered an error. Trying to delete a read-only file will
      cause the file to be deleted, even if the <b>-force</b> flags is not
      specified. If the <b>-force</b> option is specified on a directory, Tcl
      will attempt both to change permissions and move the current directory
      &#x201C;pwd&#x201D; out of the given path if that is necessary to allow
      the deletion to proceed. Arguments are processed in the order specified,
      halting at the first error, if any. A <b>--</b> marks the end of switches;
      the argument following the <b>--</b> will be treated as a <i>pathname</i>
      even if it starts with a <b>-</b>.</dd>
  <dt><b>file dirname </b><i>name</i></dt>
  <dd>Returns a name comprised of all of the path components in <i>name</i>
      excluding the last element. If <i>name</i> is a relative file name and
      only contains one path element, then returns &#x201C;<b>.</b>&#x201D;. If
      <i>name</i> refers to a root directory, then the root directory is
      returned. For example,</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b>file dirname c:/</b>
</pre>
</div>
returns <b>c:/</b>.
<p class="Pp">Note that tilde substitution will only be performed if it is
    necessary to complete the command. For example,</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b>file dirname ~/src/foo.c</b>
</pre>
</div>
returns <b>~/src</b>, whereas
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b>file dirname ~</b>
</pre>
</div>
returns <b>/home</b> (or something similar).</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>file executable </b><i>name</i></dt>
  <dd>Returns <b>1</b> if file <i>name</i> is executable by the current user,
      <b>0</b> otherwise.</dd>
  <dt><b>file exists </b><i>name</i></dt>
  <dd>Returns <b>1</b> if file <i>name</i> exists and the current user has
      search privileges for the directories leading to it, <b>0</b>
    otherwise.</dd>
  <dt><b>file extension </b><i>name</i></dt>
  <dd>Returns all of the characters in <i>name</i> after and including the last
      dot in the last element of <i>name</i>. If there is no dot in the last
      element of <i>name</i> then returns the empty string.</dd>
  <dt><b>file isdirectory </b><i>name</i></dt>
  <dd>Returns <b>1</b> if file <i>name</i> is a directory, <b>0</b>
    otherwise.</dd>
  <dt><b>file isfile </b><i>name</i></dt>
  <dd>Returns <b>1</b> if file <i>name</i> is a regular file, <b>0</b>
      otherwise.</dd>
  <dt><b>file join </b><i>name</i> ?<i>name ...</i>?</dt>
  <dd>Takes one or more file names and combines them, using the correct path
      separator for the current platform. If a particular <i>name</i> is
      relative, then it will be joined to the previous file name argument.
      Otherwise, any earlier arguments will be discarded, and joining will
      proceed from the current argument. For example,</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b>file join a b /foo bar</b>
</pre>
</div>
returns <b>/foo/bar</b>.
<p class="Pp">Note that any of the names can contain separators, and that the
    result is always canonical for the current platform: <b>/</b> for Unix and
    Windows.</p>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>file link ?</b><i>-linktype</i>? <i>linkName</i> ?<i>target</i>?</dt>
  <dd>If only one argument is given, that argument is assumed to be
      <i>linkName</i>, and this command returns the value of the link given by
      <i>linkName</i> (i.e. the name of the file it points to). If
      <i>linkName</i> is not a link or its value cannot be read (as, for
      example, seems to be the case with hard links, which look just like
      ordinary files), then an error is returned.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">If 2 arguments are given, then these are assumed to be
    <i>linkName</i> and <i>target</i>. If <i>linkName</i> already exists, or if
    <i>target</i> does not exist, an error will be returned. Otherwise, Tcl
    creates a new link called <i>linkName</i> which points to the existing
    filesystem object at <i>target</i> (which is also the returned value), where
    the type of the link is platform-specific (on Unix a symbolic link will be
    the default). This is useful for the case where the user wishes to create a
    link in a cross-platform way, and does not care what type of link is
    created.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the user wishes to make a link of a specific type only, (and
    signal an error if for some reason that is not possible), then the optional
    <i>-linktype</i> argument should be given. Accepted values for
    <i>-linktype</i> are &#x201C;-symbolic&#x201D; and
  &#x201C;-hard&#x201D;.</p>
<p class="Pp">On Unix, symbolic links can be made to relative paths, and those
    paths must be relative to the actual <i>linkName</i>'s location (not to the
    cwd), but on all other platforms where relative links are not supported,
    target paths will always be converted to absolute, normalized form before
    the link is created (and therefore relative paths are interpreted as
    relative to the cwd). Furthermore, &#x201C;~user&#x201D; paths are always
    expanded to absolute form. When creating links on filesystems that either do
    not support any links, or do not support the specific type requested, an
    error message will be returned. In particular Windows 95, 98 and ME do not
    support any links at present, but most Unix platforms support both symbolic
    and hard links (the latter for files only) and Windows NT/2000/XP (on NTFS
    drives) support symbolic directory links and hard file links.</p>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>file lstat </b><i>name varName</i></dt>
  <dd>Same as <b>stat</b> option (see below) except uses the <i>lstat</i> kernel
      call instead of <i>stat</i>. This means that if <i>name</i> refers to a
      symbolic link the information returned in <i>varName</i> is for the link
      rather than the file it refers to. On systems that do not support symbolic
      links this option behaves exactly the same as the <b>stat</b> option.</dd>
  <dt><b>file mkdir </b><i>dir</i> ?<i>dir</i> ...?</dt>
  <dd>Creates each directory specified. For each pathname <i>dir</i> specified,
      this command will create all non-existing parent directories as well as
      <i>dir</i> itself. If an existing directory is specified, then no action
      is taken and no error is returned. Trying to overwrite an existing file
      with a directory will result in an error. Arguments are processed in the
      order specified, halting at the first error, if any.</dd>
  <dt><b>file mtime </b><i>name</i> ?<i>time</i>?</dt>
  <dd>Returns a decimal string giving the time at which file <i>name</i> was
      last modified. If <i>time</i> is specified, it is a modification time to
      set for the file (equivalent to Unix <b>touch</b>). The time is measured
      in the standard POSIX fashion as seconds from a fixed starting time (often
      January 1, 1970). If the file does not exist or its modified time cannot
      be queried or set then an error is generated.</dd>
  <dt><b>file nativename </b><i>name</i></dt>
  <dd>Returns the platform-specific name of the file. This is useful if the
      filename is needed to pass to a platform-specific call, such as to a
      subprocess via <b>exec</b> under Windows (see <b>EXAMPLES</b> below).</dd>
  <dt><b>file normalize </b><i>name</i></dt>
  <dd>Returns a unique normalized path representation for the file-system object
      (file, directory, link, etc), whose string value can be used as a unique
      identifier for it. A normalized path is an absolute path which has all
      &#x201C;../&#x201D; and &#x201C;./&#x201D; removed. Also it is one which
      is in the &#x201C;standard&#x201D; format for the native platform. On
      Unix, this means the segments leading up to the path must be free of
      symbolic links/aliases (but the very last path component may be a symbolic
      link), and on Windows it also means we want the long form with that form's
      case-dependence (which gives us a unique, case-dependent path). The one
      exception concerning the last link in the path is necessary, because Tcl
      or the user may wish to operate on the actual symbolic link itself (for
      example <b>file delete</b>, <b>file rename</b>, <b>file copy</b> are
      defined to operate on symbolic links, not on the things that they point
      to).</dd>
  <dt><b>file owned </b><i>name</i></dt>
  <dd>Returns <b>1</b> if file <i>name</i> is owned by the current user,
      <b>0</b> otherwise.</dd>
  <dt><b>file pathtype </b><i>name</i></dt>
  <dd>Returns one of <b>absolute</b>, <b>relative</b>, <b>volumerelative</b>. If
      <i>name</i> refers to a specific file on a specific volume, the path type
      will be <b>absolute</b>. If <i>name</i> refers to a file relative to the
      current working directory, then the path type will be <b>relative</b>. If
      <i>name</i> refers to a file relative to the current working directory on
      a specified volume, or to a specific file on the current working volume,
      then the path type is <b>volumerelative</b>.</dd>
  <dt><b>file readable </b><i>name</i></dt>
  <dd>Returns <b>1</b> if file <i>name</i> is readable by the current user,
      <b>0</b> otherwise.</dd>
  <dt><b>file readlink </b><i>name</i></dt>
  <dd>Returns the value of the symbolic link given by <i>name</i> (i.e. the name
      of the file it points to). If <i>name</i> is npt a symbolic link or its
      value cannot be read, then an error is returned. On systems that do not
      support symbolic links this option is undefined.</dd>
  <dt><b>file rename </b>?<b>-force</b>? ?<b>--</b>? <i>source</i>
    <i>target</i></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>file rename </b>?<b>-force</b>? ?<b>--</b>? <i>source</i>
    ?<i>source</i> ...? <i>targetDir</i></dt>
  <dd>The first form takes the file or directory specified by pathname
      <i>source</i> and renames it to <i>target</i>, moving the file if the
      pathname <i>target</i> specifies a name in a different directory. If
      <i>target</i> is an existing directory, then the second form is used. The
      second form moves each <i>source</i> file or directory into the directory
      <i>targetDir</i>. Existing files will not be overwritten unless the
      <b>-force</b> option is specified. When operating inside a single
      filesystem, Tcl will rename symbolic links rather than the things that
      they point to. Trying to overwrite a non-empty directory, overwrite a
      directory with a file, or a file with a directory will all result in
      errors. Arguments are processed in the order specified, halting at the
      first error, if any. A <b>--</b> marks the end of switches; the argument
      following the <b>--</b> will be treated as a <i>source</i> even if it
      starts with a <b>-</b>.</dd>
  <dt><b>file rootname </b><i>name</i></dt>
  <dd>Returns all of the characters in <i>name</i> up to but not including the
      last &#x201C;.&#x201D; character in the last component of name. If the
      last component of <i>name</i> does not contain a dot, then returns
      <i>name</i>.</dd>
  <dt><b>file separator</b> ?<i>name</i>?</dt>
  <dd>If no argument is given, returns the character which is used to separate
      path segments for native files on this platform. If a path is given, the
      filesystem responsible for that path is asked to return its separator
      character. If no file system accepts <i>name</i>, an error is
    generated.</dd>
  <dt><b>file size </b><i>name</i></dt>
  <dd>Returns a decimal string giving the size of file <i>name</i> in bytes. If
      the file does not exist or its size cannot be queried then an error is
      generated.</dd>
  <dt><b>file split </b><i>name</i></dt>
  <dd>Returns a list whose elements are the path components in <i>name</i>. The
      first element of the list will have the same path type as <i>name</i>. All
      other elements will be relative. Path separators will be discarded unless
      they are needed ensure that an element is unambiguously relative. For
      example, under Unix</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
file split /foo/~bar/baz
</pre>
</div>
returns <b>/&#x2002;&#x2002;foo&#x2002;&#x2002;./~bar&#x2002;&#x2002;baz</b> to
  ensure that later commands that use the third component do not attempt to
  perform tilde substitution.</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>file stat </b><i>name varName</i></dt>
  <dd>Invokes the <b>stat</b> kernel call on <i>name</i>, and uses the variable
      given by <i>varName</i> to hold information returned from the kernel call.
      <i>VarName</i> is treated as an array variable, and the following elements
      of that variable are set: <b>atime</b>, <b>ctime</b>, <b>dev</b>,
      <b>gid</b>, <b>ino</b>, <b>mode</b>, <b>mtime</b>, <b>nlink</b>,
      <b>size</b>, <b>type</b>, <b>uid</b>. Each element except <b>type</b> is a
      decimal string with the value of the corresponding field from the
      <b>stat</b> return structure; see the manual entry for <b>stat</b> for
      details on the meanings of the values. The <b>type</b> element gives the
      type of the file in the same form returned by the command <b>file
      type</b>. This command returns an empty string.</dd>
  <dt><b>file system </b><i>name</i></dt>
  <dd>Returns a list of one or two elements, the first of which is the name of
      the filesystem to use for the file, and the second, if given, an arbitrary
      string representing the filesystem-specific nature or type of the location
      within that filesystem. If a filesystem only supports one type of file,
      the second element may not be supplied. For example the native files have
      a first element &#x201C;native&#x201D;, and a second element which when
      given is a platform-specific type name for the file's system (e.g.
      &#x201C;NTFS&#x201D;, &#x201C;FAT&#x201D;, on Windows). A generic virtual
      file system might return the list &#x201C;vfs ftp&#x201D; to represent a
      file on a remote ftp site mounted as a virtual filesystem through an
      extension called &#x201C;vfs&#x201D;. If the file does not belong to any
      filesystem, an error is generated.</dd>
  <dt><b>file tail </b><i>name</i></dt>
  <dd>Returns all of the characters in the last filesystem component of
      <i>name</i>. Any trailing directory separator in <i>name</i> is ignored.
      If <i>name</i> contains no separators then returns <i>name</i>. So,
      <b>file tail a/b</b>, <b>file tail a/b/</b> and <b>file tail b</b> all
      return <b>b</b>.</dd>
  <dt><b>file type </b><i>name</i></dt>
  <dd>Returns a string giving the type of file <i>name</i>, which will be one of
      <b>file</b>, <b>directory</b>, <b>characterSpecial</b>,
      <b>blockSpecial</b>, <b>fifo</b>, <b>link</b>, or <b>socket</b>.</dd>
  <dt><b>file volumes</b></dt>
  <dd>Returns the absolute paths to the volumes mounted on the system, as a
      proper Tcl list. Without any virtual filesystems mounted as root volumes,
      on UNIX, the command will always return &#x201C;/&#x201D;, since all
      filesystems are locally mounted. On Windows, it will return a list of the
      available local drives (e.g. &#x201C;a:/ c:/&#x201D;). If any virtual
      filesystem has mounted additional volumes, they will be in the returned
      list.</dd>
  <dt><b>file writable </b><i>name</i></dt>
  <dd>Returns <b>1</b> if file <i>name</i> is writable by the current user,
      <b>0</b> otherwise.</dd>
