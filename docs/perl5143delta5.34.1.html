  unsafe use of eval (CVE-2011-3597)</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;Digest-&gt;new()&quot;</span> function
    did not properly sanitize input before using it in an <b>eval()</b> call,
    which could lead to the injection of arbitrary Perl code.</p>
<p class="Pp">In order to exploit this flaw, the attacker would need to be able
    to set the algorithm name used, or be able to execute arbitrary Perl code
    already.</p>

  buffer overrun in 'x' string repeat operator (CVE-2012-5195)</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Poorly written perl code that allows an attacker to specify the
    count to perl's 'x' string repeat operator can already cause a memory
    exhaustion denial-of-service attack. A flaw in versions of perl before
    5.15.5 can escalate that into a heap buffer overrun; coupled with versions
    of glibc before 2.16, it possibly allows the execution of arbitrary
  code.</p>

  <li>A regression has been fixed that was introduced in 5.14, in
      <span class="Li">&quot;/i&quot;</span> regular expression matching, in
      which a match improperly fails if the pattern is in UTF-8, the target
      string is not, and a Latin-1 character precedes a character in the string
      that should match the pattern. [perl #101710]</li>
  <li>In case-insensitive regular expression pattern matching, no longer on
      UTF-8 encoded strings does the scan for the start of match only look at
      the first possible position. This caused matches such as
      <span class="Li">&quot;&quot;f\x{FB00}&quot; =~ /ff/i&quot;</span> to
      fail.</li>
  <li>The sitecustomize support was made relocatableinc aware, so that
      -Dusesitecustomize and -Duserelocatableinc may be used together.</li>
  <li>The smartmatch operator (<span class="Li">&quot;~~&quot;</span>) was
      changed so that the right-hand side takes precedence during
      <span class="Li">&quot;Any ~~ Object&quot;</span> operations.</li>
  <li>A bug has been fixed in the tainting support, in which an
      <span class="Li">&quot;index()&quot;</span> operation on a tainted
      constant would cause all other constants to become tainted. [perl
    #64804]</li>
  <li>A regression has been fixed that was introduced in perl 5.12, whereby
      tainting errors were not correctly propagated through
      <span class="Li">&quot;die()&quot;</span>. [perl #111654]</li>
  <li>A regression has been fixed that was introduced in perl 5.14, in which
      <span class="Li">&quot;/[[:lower:]]/i&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;/[[:upper:]]/i&quot;</span> no longer matched the
      opposite case. [perl #101970]</li>

<p class="Pp">Perl 5.14.3 represents approximately 12 months of development
    since Perl 5.14.2 and contains approximately 2,300 lines of changes across
    64 files from 22 authors.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl continues to flourish into its third decade thanks to a
    vibrant community of users and developers. The following people are known to
    have contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.14.3:</p>
<p class="Pp">Abigail, Andy Dougherty, Carl Hayter, Chris 'BinGOs' Williams,
    Dave Rolsky, David Mitchell, Dominic Hargreaves, Father Chrysostomos,
    Florian Ragwitz, H.Merijn Brand, Jilles Tjoelker, Karl Williamson, Leon
    Timmermans, Michael G Schwern, Nicholas Clark, Niko Tyni, Pino Toscano,
    Ricardo Signes, Salvador Fandin~o, Samuel Thibault, Steve Hay, Tony
  Cook.</p>
<p class="Pp">The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is
    automatically generated from version control history. In particular, it does
    not include the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who
    reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.</p>
<p class="Pp">Many of the changes included in this version originated in the
    CPAN modules included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire CPAN
    community for helping Perl to flourish.</p>

  Bugs</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles
    recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug
    database at http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ . There may also be information at
    http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug
    program included with your release. Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny
    but sufficient test case. Your bug report, along with the output of
    <span class="Li">&quot;perl -V&quot;</span>, will be sent off to
    perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make
    it inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please
    send it to perl5-security-report@perl.org. This points to a closed
    subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core
    committers, who be able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a
    resolution, and help co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix
    the problem across all platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use
    this address for security issues in the Perl core, not for modules
    independently distributed on CPAN.</p>
