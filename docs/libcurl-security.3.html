<p class="Pp">libcurl-security - security considerations when using libcurl</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="Security"><a class="permalink" href="#Security">Security</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The libcurl project takes security seriously. The library is
    written with caution and precautions are taken to mitigate many kinds of
    risks encountered while operating with potentially malicious servers on the
    Internet. It is a powerful library, however, which allows application
    writers to make trade-offs between ease of writing and exposure to potential
    risky operations. If used the right way, you can use libcurl to transfer
    data pretty safely.</p>
<p class="Pp">Many applications are used in closed networks where users and
    servers can (possibly) be trusted, but many others are used on arbitrary
    servers and are fed input from potentially untrusted users. Following is a
    discussion about some risks in the ways in which applications commonly use
    libcurl and potential mitigations of those risks. It is not comprehensive,
    but shows classes of attacks that robust applications should consider. The
    Common Weakness Enumeration project at https://cwe.mitre.org/ is a good
    reference for many of these and similar types of weaknesses of which
    application writers should be aware.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="Command_Lines"><a class="permalink" href="#Command_Lines">Command
  Lines</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">If you use a command line tool (such as curl) that uses libcurl,
    and you give options to the tool on the command line those options can get
    read by other users of your system when they use <i>ps</i> or other tools to
    list currently running processes.</p>
<p class="Pp">To avoid these problems, never feed sensitive things to programs
    using command line options. Write them to a protected file and use the -K
    option to avoid this.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id=".netrc"><a class="permalink" href="#.netrc">.netrc</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">.netrc is a pretty handy file/feature that allows you to login
    quickly and automatically to frequently visited sites. The file contains
    passwords in clear text and is a real security risk. In some cases, your
    .netrc is also stored in a home directory that is NFS mounted or used on
    another network based file system, so the clear text password flies through
    your network every time anyone reads that file.</p>
<p class="Pp">For applications that enable .netrc use, a user who manage to set
    the right URL might then be possible to pass on passwords.</p>
<p class="Pp">To avoid these problems, do not use .netrc files and never store
    passwords in plain text anywhere.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="Clear_Text_Passwords"><a class="permalink" href="#Clear_Text_Passwords">Clear
  Text Passwords</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Many of the protocols libcurl supports send name and password
    unencrypted as clear text (HTTP Basic authentication, FTP, TELNET etc). It
    is easy for anyone on your network or a network nearby yours to just fire up
    a network analyzer tool and eavesdrop on your passwords. Do not let the fact
    that HTTP Basic uses base64 encoded passwords fool you. They may not look
    readable at a first glance, but they are easily &quot;deciphered&quot; by
    anyone within seconds.</p>
<p class="Pp">To avoid this problem, use an authentication mechanism or other
    protocol that does not let snoopers see your password: Digest, CRAM-MD5,
    Kerberos, SPNEGO or NTLM authentication. Or even better: use authenticated
    protocols that protect the entire connection and everything sent over
  it.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="Unauthenticated_Connections"><a class="permalink" href="#Unauthenticated_Connections">Unauthenticated
  Connections</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Protocols that do not have any form of cryptographic
    authentication cannot with any certainty know that they communicate with the
    right remote server.</p>
<p class="Pp">If your application is using a fixed scheme or fixed hostname, it
    is not safe as long as the connection is unauthenticated. There can be a
    man-in-the-middle or in fact the whole server might have been replaced by an
    evil actor.</p>
<p class="Pp">Unauthenticated protocols are unsafe. The data that comes back to
    curl may have been injected by an attacker. The data that curl sends might
    be modified before it reaches the intended server. If it even reaches the
    intended server at all.</p>
<p class="Pp">Remedies:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="Restrict"><a class="permalink" href="#Restrict">Restrict operations to
    authenticated transfers</a></dt>
  <dd>Use authenticated protocols protected with HTTPS or SSH.</dd>
  <dt id="Make"><a class="permalink" href="#Make">Make sure the server's
    certificate etc is verified</a></dt>
  <dd>Never ever switch off certificate verification.</dd>
</dl>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="Redirects"><a class="permalink" href="#Redirects">Redirects</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The <i>CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION(3)</i> option automatically follows
    HTTP redirects sent by a remote server. These redirects can refer to any
    kind of URL, not just HTTP. libcurl restricts the protocols allowed to be
    used in redirects for security reasons: only HTTP, HTTPS, FTP and FTPS are
    enabled by default. Applications may opt to restrict that set further.</p>
<p class="Pp">A redirect to a file: URL would cause the libcurl to read (or
    write) arbitrary files from the local filesystem. If the application returns
    the data back to the user (as would happen in some kinds of CGI scripts), an
    attacker could leverage this to read otherwise forbidden data (e.g.
    <b>file://localhost/etc/passwd</b>).</p>
<p class="Pp">If authentication credentials are stored in the ~/.netrc file, or
    Kerberos is in use, any other URL type (not just file:) that requires
    authentication is also at risk. A redirect such as
    <b>ftp://some-internal-server/private-file</b> would then return data even
    when the server is password protected.</p>
<p class="Pp">In the same way, if an unencrypted SSH private key has been
    configured for the user running the libcurl application, SCP: or SFTP: URLs
    could access password or private-key protected resources, e.g.
    <b>sftp://user@some-internal-server/etc/passwd</b></p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>CURLOPT_REDIR_PROTOCOLS(3)</i> and <i>CURLOPT_NETRC(3)</i>
    options can be used to mitigate against this kind of attack.</p>
<p class="Pp">A redirect can also specify a location available only on the
    machine running libcurl, including servers hidden behind a firewall from the
    attacker. E.g. <b>http://127.0.0.1/</b> or
    <b>http://intranet/delete-stuff.cgi?delete=all</b> or
    <b>tftp://bootp-server/pc-config-data</b></p>
<p class="Pp">Applications can mitigate against this by disabling
    <i>CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION(3)</i> and handling redirects itself, sanitizing
    URLs as necessary. Alternately, an app could leave
    <i>CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION(3)</i> enabled but set
    <i>CURLOPT_REDIR_PROTOCOLS(3)</i> and install a
    <i>CURLOPT_OPENSOCKETFUNCTION(3)</i> or <i>CURLOPT_PREREQFUNCTION(3)</i>
    callback function in which addresses are sanitized before use.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="CRLF_in_Headers"><a class="permalink" href="#CRLF_in_Headers">CRLF
  in Headers</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">For all options in libcurl which specify headers, including but
    not limited to <i>CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER(3)</i>, <i>CURLOPT_PROXYHEADER(3)</i>,
    <i>CURLOPT_COOKIE(3)</i>, <i>CURLOPT_USERAGENT(3)</i>,
    <i>CURLOPT_REFERER(3)</i> and <i>CURLOPT_RANGE(3)</i>, libcurl sends the
    headers as-is and does not apply any special sanitation or normalization to
    them.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you allow untrusted user input into these options without
    sanitizing CRLF sequences in them, someone malicious may be able to modify
    the request in a way you did not intend such as injecting new headers.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="Local_Resources"><a class="permalink" href="#Local_Resources">Local
  Resources</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">A user who can control the DNS server of a domain being passed in
    within a URL can change the address of the host to a local, private address
    which a server-side libcurl-using application could then use. E.g. the
    innocuous URL <b>http://fuzzybunnies.example.com/</b> could actually resolve
    to the IP address of a server behind a firewall, such as 127.0.0.1 or
    10.1.2.3. Applications can mitigate against this by setting a
    <i>CURLOPT_OPENSOCKETFUNCTION(3)</i> or <i>CURLOPT_PREREQFUNCTION(3)</i> and
    checking the address before a connection.</p>
<p class="Pp">All the malicious scenarios regarding redirected URLs apply just
    as well to non-redirected URLs, if the user is allowed to specify an
    arbitrary URL that could point to a private resource. For example, a web app
    providing a translation service might happily translate
    <b>file://localhost/etc/passwd</b> and display the result. Applications can
    mitigate against this with the <i>CURLOPT_PROTOCOLS(3)</i> option as well as
    by similar mitigation techniques for redirections.</p>
<p class="Pp">A malicious FTP server could in response to the PASV command
    return an IP address and port number for a server local to the app running
    libcurl but behind a firewall. Applications can mitigate against this by
    using the <i>CURLOPT_FTP_SKIP_PASV_IP(3)</i> option or
    <i>CURLOPT_FTPPORT(3)</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Local servers sometimes assume local access comes from friends and
    trusted users. An application that expects https://example.com/file_to_read
    that and instead gets http://192.168.0.1/my_router_config might print a file
    that would otherwise be protected by the firewall.</p>
<p class="Pp">Allowing your application to connect to local hosts, be it the
    same machine that runs the application or a machine on the same local
    network, might be possible to exploit by an attacker who then perhaps can
    &quot;port-scan&quot; the particular hosts - depending on how the
    application and servers acts.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="IPv4_Addresses"><a class="permalink" href="#IPv4_Addresses">IPv4
  Addresses</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Some users might be tempted to filter access to local resources or
    similar based on numerical IPv4 addresses used in URLs. This is a bad and
    error-prone idea because of the many different ways a numerical IPv4 address
    can be specified and libcurl accepts: one to four dot-separated fields using
    one of or a mix of decimal, octal or hexadecimal encoding.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="IPv6_Addresses"><a class="permalink" href="#IPv6_Addresses">IPv6
  Addresses</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">libcurl handles IPv6 addresses transparently and just as easily as
    IPv4 addresses. That means that a sanitizing function that filters out
    addresses like 127.0.0.1 is not sufficient - the equivalent IPv6 addresses
    <b>::1</b>, <b>::</b>, <b>0:00::0:1</b>, <b>::127.0.0.1</b> and
    <b>::ffff:7f00:1</b> supplied somehow by an attacker would all bypass a
    naive filter and could allow access to undesired local resources. IPv6 also
    has special address blocks like link-local and site-local that generally
    should not be accessed by a server-side libcurl-using application. A poorly
    configured firewall installed in a data center, organization or server may
    also be configured to limit IPv4 connections but leave IPv6 connections wide
    open. In some cases, setting <i>CURLOPT_IPRESOLVE(3)</i> to
    CURL_IPRESOLVE_V4 can be used to limit resolved addresses to IPv4 only and
    bypass these issues.</p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="Uploads"><a class="permalink" href="#Uploads">Uploads</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">When uploading, a redirect can cause a local (or remote) file to
    be overwritten. Applications must not allow any unsanitized URL to be passed
    in for uploads. Also, <i>CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION(3)</i> should not be used on
    uploads. Instead, the applications should consider handling redirects
    itself, sanitizing each URL first.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="Authentication"><a class="permalink" href="#Authentication">Authentication</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Use of <i>CURLOPT_UNRESTRICTED_AUTH(3)</i> could cause
    authentication information to be sent to an unknown second server.
    Applications can mitigate against this by disabling
    <i>CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION(3)</i> and handling redirects itself, sanitizing
    where necessary.</p>
<p class="Pp">Use of the CURLAUTH_ANY option to <i>CURLOPT_HTTPAUTH(3)</i> could
    result in user name and password being sent in clear text to an HTTP server.
    Instead, use CURLAUTH_ANYSAFE which ensures that the password is encrypted
    over the network, or else fail the request.</p>
<p class="Pp">Use of the CURLUSESSL_TRY option to <i>CURLOPT_USE_SSL(3)</i>
    could result in user name and password being sent in clear text to an FTP
    server. Instead, use CURLUSESSL_CONTROL to ensure that an encrypted
    connection is used or else fail the request.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="Cookies"><a class="permalink" href="#Cookies">Cookies</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">If cookies are enabled and cached, then a user could craft a URL
    which performs some malicious action to a site whose authentication is
    already stored in a cookie. E.g.
    <b>http://mail.example.com/delete-stuff.cgi?delete=all</b> Applications can
    mitigate against this by disabling cookies or clearing them between
    requests.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="Dangerous_SCP_URLs"><a class="permalink" href="#Dangerous_SCP_URLs">Dangerous
  SCP URLs</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">SCP URLs can contain raw commands within the scp: URL, which is a
    side effect of how the SCP protocol is designed. E.g.</p>
<pre>
<br/>
  scp://user:pass@host/a;date &gt;/tmp/test;</pre>
<p class="Pp">Applications must not allow unsanitized SCP: URLs to be passed in
    for downloads.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="file://"><a class="permalink" href="#file://">file://</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">By default curl and libcurl support file:// URLs. Such a URL is
    always an access, or attempted access, to a local resource. If your
    application wants to avoid that, keep control of what URLs to use and/or
    prevent curl/libcurl from using the protocol.</p>
<p class="Pp">By default, libcurl prohibits redirects to file:// URLs.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="Warning:_file://_on_Windows"><a class="permalink" href="#Warning:_file://_on_Windows">Warning:
  file:// on Windows</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The Windows operating system tries automatically, and without any
    way for applications to disable it, to establish a connection to another
    host over the network and access it (over SMB or other protocols), if only
    the correct file path is accessed.</p>
<p class="Pp">When first realizing this, the curl team tried to filter out such
    attempts in order to protect applications for inadvertent probes of for
    example internal networks etc. This resulted in CVE-2019-15601 and the
    associated security fix.</p>
<p class="Pp">However, we have since been made aware of the fact that the
    previous fix was far from adequate as there are several other ways to
    accomplish more or less the same thing: accessing a remote host over the
    network instead of the local file system.</p>
<p class="Pp">The conclusion we have come to is that this is a weakness or
    feature in the Windows operating system itself, that we as an application
    cannot safely protect users against. It would just be a whack-a-mole race we
    do not want to participate in. There are too many ways to do it and there is
    no knob we can use to turn off the practice.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you use curl or libcurl on Windows (any version), disable the
    use of the FILE protocol in curl or be prepared that accesses to a range of
    &quot;magic paths&quot; potentially make your system access other hosts on
    your network. curl cannot protect you against this.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="What_if_the_user_can_set_the_URL"><a class="permalink" href="#What_if_the_user_can_set_the_URL">What
  if the user can set the URL</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Applications may find it tempting to let users set the URL that it
    can work on. That is probably fine, but opens up for mischief and trickery
    that you as an application author may want to address or take precautions
    against.</p>
<p class="Pp">If your curl-using script allow a custom URL do you also, perhaps
    unintentionally, allow the user to pass other options to the curl command
    line if creative use of special characters are applied?</p>
<p class="Pp">If the user can set the URL, the user can also specify the scheme
    part to other protocols that you did not intend for users to use and perhaps
    did not consider. curl supports over 20 different URL schemes.
    &quot;http://&quot; might be what you thought, &quot;ftp://&quot; or
    &quot;imap://&quot; might be what the user gives your application. Also,
    cross-protocol operations might be done by using a particular scheme in the
    URL but point to a server doing a different protocol on a non-standard
  port.</p>
<p class="Pp">Remedies:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="Use"><a class="permalink" href="#Use">Use --proto</a></dt>

  <dt id="consider"><a class="permalink" href="#consider">consider not allowing

<h1 class="Sh" id="RFC_3986_vs_WHATWG_URL"><a class="permalink" href="#RFC_3986_vs_WHATWG_URL">RFC
  3986 vs WHATWG URL</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">curl supports URLs mostly according to how they are defined in RFC
    3986, and has done so since the beginning.</p>
<p class="Pp">Web browsers mostly adhere to the WHATWG URL Specification.</p>
<p class="Pp">This deviance makes some URLs copied between browsers (or returned
    over HTTP for redirection) and curl not work the same way. It can also cause
    problems if an application parses URLs differently from libcurl and makes
    different assumptions about a link. This can mislead users into getting the
    wrong thing, connecting to the wrong host or otherwise not working
    identically.</p>
<p class="Pp">Within an application, this can be mitigated by always using the
    <i>curl_url(3)</i> API to parse URLs, ensuring that they are parsed the same
    way as within libcurl itself.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="FTP_uses_two_connections"><a class="permalink" href="#FTP_uses_two_connections">FTP
  uses two connections</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">When performing an FTP transfer, two TCP connections are used: one
    for setting up the transfer and one for the actual data.</p>
<p class="Pp">FTP is not only unauthenticated, but the setting up of the second
    transfer is also a weak spot. The second connection to use for data, is
    either setup with the PORT/EPRT command that makes the server connect back
    to the client on the given IP+PORT, or with PASV/EPSV that makes the server
    setup a port to listen to and tells the client to connect to a given
    IP+PORT.</p>
<p class="Pp">Again, unauthenticated means that the connection might be meddled
    with by a man-in-the-middle or that there is a malicious server pretending
    to be the right one.</p>
<p class="Pp">A malicious FTP server can respond to PASV commands with the
    IP+PORT of a totally different machine. Perhaps even a third party host, and
    when there are many clients trying to connect to that third party, it could
    create a Distributed Denial-Of-Service attack out of it. If the client makes
    an upload operation, it can make the client send the data to another site.
    If the attacker can affect what data the client uploads, it can be made to
    work as a HTTP request and then the client could be made to issue HTTP
    requests to third party hosts.</p>
<p class="Pp">An attacker that manages to control curl's command line options
    can tell curl to send an FTP PORT command to ask the server to connect to a
    third party host instead of back to curl.</p>
<p class="Pp">The fact that FTP uses two connections makes it vulnerable in a
    way that is hard to avoid.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="Denial_of_Service"><a class="permalink" href="#Denial_of_Service">Denial
  of Service</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">A malicious server could cause libcurl to effectively hang by
    sending data slowly, or even no data at all but just keeping the TCP
    connection open. This could effectively result in a denial-of-service
    attack. The <i>CURLOPT_TIMEOUT(3)</i> and/or
    <i>CURLOPT_LOW_SPEED_LIMIT(3)</i> options can be used to mitigate against
    this.</p>
<p class="Pp">A malicious server could cause libcurl to download an infinite
    amount of data, potentially causing all of memory or disk to be filled.
    Setting the <i>CURLOPT_MAXFILESIZE_LARGE(3)</i> option is not sufficient to
    guard against this. Instead, applications should monitor the amount of data
    received within the write or progress callback and abort once the limit is
    reached.</p>
<p class="Pp">A malicious HTTP server could cause an infinite redirection loop,
    causing a denial-of-service. This can be mitigated by using the
    <i>CURLOPT_MAXREDIRS(3)</i> option.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="Arbitrary_Headers"><a class="permalink" href="#Arbitrary_Headers">Arbitrary
  Headers</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">User-supplied data must be sanitized when used in options like
    <i>CURLOPT_USERAGENT(3)</i>, <i>CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER(3)</i>,
    <i>CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS(3)</i> and others that are used to generate structured
    data. Characters like embedded carriage returns or ampersands could allow
    the user to create additional headers or fields that could cause malicious
    transactions.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="Server-supplied_Names"><a class="permalink" href="#Server-supplied_Names">Server-supplied
  Names</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">A server can supply data which the application may, in some cases,
    use as a filename. The curl command-line tool does this with
    <i>--remote-header-name</i>, using the Content-disposition: header to
    generate a filename. An application could also use
    <i>CURLINFO_EFFECTIVE_URL(3)</i> to generate a filename from a
    server-supplied redirect URL. Special care must be taken to sanitize such
    names to avoid the possibility of a malicious server supplying one like
    <b>&quot;/etc/passwd&quot;</b>, <b>&quot;autoexec.bat&quot;</b>,
    <b>&quot;prn:&quot;</b> or even <b>&quot;.bashrc&quot;</b>.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="Server_Certificates"><a class="permalink" href="#Server_Certificates">Server
  Certificates</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">A secure application should never use the
    <i>CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER(3)</i> option to disable certificate validation.
    There are numerous attacks that are enabled by applications that fail to
    properly validate server TLS/SSL certificates, thus enabling a malicious
    server to spoof a legitimate one. HTTPS without validated certificates is
    potentially as insecure as a plain HTTP connection.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="Showing_What_You_Do"><a class="permalink" href="#Showing_What_You_Do">Showing
  What You Do</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Relatedly, be aware that in situations when you have problems with
    libcurl and ask someone for help, everything you reveal in order to get best
    possible help might also impose certain security related risks. Host names,
    user names, paths, operating system specifics, etc. (not to mention
    passwords of course) may in fact be used by intruders to gain additional
    information of a potential target.</p>
<p class="Pp">Be sure to limit access to application logs if they could hold
    private or security-related data. Besides the obvious candidates like user
    names and passwords, things like URLs, cookies or even file names could also
    hold sensitive data.</p>
<p class="Pp">To avoid this problem, you must of course use your common sense.
    Often, you can just edit out the sensitive data or just search/replace your
    true information with faked data.</p>

    elevated or modified rights also implicitly give that extra power to libcurl
    and this should only be done after careful considerations.</p>
<p class="Pp">Giving setuid powers to the application means that libcurl can
    save files using those new rights (if for example the <i>SSLKEYLOGFILE</i>
    environment variable is set). Also: if the application wants these powers to
    read or manage secrets that the user is otherwise not able to view (like
    credentials for a login etc), it should be noted that libcurl still might
    understand proxy environment variables that allow the user to redirect
    libcurl operations to use a proxy controlled by the user.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="File_descriptors,_fork_and_NTLM"><a class="permalink" href="#File_descriptors,_fork_and_NTLM">File
  descriptors, fork and NTLM</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">An application that uses libcurl and invokes <i>fork()</i> gets
    all file descriptors duplicated in the child process, including the ones
    libcurl created.</p>
<p class="Pp">libcurl itself uses <i>fork()</i> and <i>execl()</i> if told to
    use the <b>CURLAUTH_NTLM_WB</b> authentication method which then invokes the
    helper command in a child process with file descriptors duplicated. Make
    sure that only the trusted and reliable helper program is invoked!</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="Secrets_in_memory"><a class="permalink" href="#Secrets_in_memory">Secrets
  in memory</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">When applications pass user names, passwords or other sensitive
    data to libcurl to be used for upcoming transfers, those secrets are kept
    around as-is in memory. In many cases they are stored in the heap for as
    long as the handle itself for which the options are set.</p>
<p class="Pp">If an attacker can access the heap, like maybe by reading swap
    space or via a core dump file, such data might be accessible.</p>
<p class="Pp">Further, when eventually closing a handle and the secrets are no
    longer needed, libcurl does not explicitly clear memory before freeing it,
    so credentials may be left in freed data.</p>

<p class="Pp">libcurl cannot protect against attacks where an attacker has write
    access to the same directory where libcurl is directed to save files.</p>

<p class="Pp">If libcurl is built with PSL (<b>Public Suffix List</b>) support,
    it detects and discards cookies that are specified for such suffix domains
    that should not be allowed to have cookies.</p>
<p class="Pp">if libcurl is <i>not</i> built with PSL support, it has no ability
    to stop super cookies.</p>
