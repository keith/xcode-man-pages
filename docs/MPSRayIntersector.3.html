  Description</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Performs intersection tests between rays and the geometry in an
    <b>MPSAccelerationStructure</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">An <b>MPSRayIntersector</b> is used to schedule intersection tests
    between rays and geometry into an MTLCommandBuffer. First, create a
    raytracer with a Metal device. Then, configure the properties of the
    raytracer:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>id &lt;MTLDevice&gt; device = MTLCreateSystemDefaultDevice();
id &lt;MTLCommandQueue&gt; commandQueue = [device newCommandQueue];
MPSRayIntersector *raytracer = [[MPSRayIntersector alloc] initWithDevice:device];
// Configure raytracer properties</pre>
<p class="Pp">Before scheduling intersection tests, an
    <b>MPSAccelerationStructure</b> must be created. The acceleration structure
    is built over geometry and is used to accelerate intersection testing. For
    example, to create a triangle acceleration structure, allocate an
    <b>MPSTriangleAccelerationStructure</b> object. Then, configure the
    properties of the acceleration structure. For example, triangle acceleration
    structures require a vertex buffer and a triangle count:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>MPSTriangleAccelerationStructure *accelerationStructure = 
<br/>
    [[MPSTriangleAccelerationStructure alloc] initWithDevice:device];
accelerationStructure.vertexBuffer = vertexBuffer;
accelerationStructure.triangleCount = triangleCount;</pre>
<p class="Pp">Acceleration structures must be built at least once before they
    are used for intersection testing, and must be rebuilt when the geometry
    changes. Rebuilding an acceleration structure is a time consuming operation,
    so an asynchronous version of this method is also available.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>[accelerationStructure rebuild];</pre>
<p class="Pp">The raytracer is then used to schedule intersection tests into an
    MTLCommandBuffer. Rays are provided in batches through a Metal buffer, and
    intersection results are returned through another Metal buffer in the same
    order, one intersection per ray.</p>
<p class="Pp">There are several choices of ray data type controlled by the
    rayDataType property. The default ray data type is
    <b>MPSRayOriginDirection</b>, which includes just the ray origin direction.
    The other data types add support for minimum and maximum intersection
    distances and ray masks. These data types are available in the Metal Shading
    Language by including the MetalPerformanceShaders/MetalPerformanceShaders.h
    header. Additional application specific per-ray data can also be appended to
    the end of the ray data type using the rayStride property. This data will be
    ignored by the intersector.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the rays were generated on the CPU:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>typedef MPSRayOriginDirection Ray;
// Create a buffer to hold the rays
id &lt;MTLBuffer&gt; rayBuffer = [device newBufferWithLength:sizeof(Ray) * rayCount options:0];
// Copy the rays into the ray buffer
memcpy(rayBuffer.contents, rays, sizeof(Ray) * rayCount);
// Create a buffer to hold the intersections
id &lt;MTLBuffer&gt; intersectionBuffer = [device newBufferWithLength:sizeof(Intersection) * rayCount
<br/>
                                                        options:0];</pre>
<p class="Pp">It can be useful to prevent certain rays from participating in
    intersection testing. For example: rays which have bounced out of the scene
    in previous intersection tests. It may be more efficient to do this by
    compacting the ray buffer so that threads with invalid rays are not left
    idle during intersection testing. However, it can be more convenient to
    disable the ray in place. This can be done by setting most fields to invalid
    values. For example, setting the maximum distance to a negative value,
    setting the mask to zero, setting the direction to the zero vector, etc.</p>
<p class="Pp">Finally, the intersection testing is encoded into an
    MTLCommandBuffer. There are two intersection types. The 'nearest'
    intersection type returns the closest intersection along each ray. The 'any'
    intersection type returns immediately when the first intersection is found.
    The 'any' intersection type is useful for determining whether a point is
    visible from another point for, e.g., shadow rays or ambient occlusion rays
    and is typically much faster than the 'nearest' intersection type.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>id &lt;MTLCommandBuffer&gt; commandBuffer = [commandQueue commandBuffer];
[raytracer encodeIntersectionToCommandBuffer:commandBuffer
<br/>
                            intersectionType:MPSIntersectionTypeNearest
<br/>
                                   rayBuffer:rayBuffer
<br/>
                             rayBufferOffset:0
<br/>
                          intersectionBuffer:intersectionBuffer
<br/>
                    intersectionBufferOffset:0
<br/>

<br/>
                       accelerationStructure:accelerationStructure];
[commandBuffer commit];</pre>
<p class="Pp">The intersection results are not available until the command
    buffer has finished executing on the GPU. It is not safe for the CPU to
    write or read the contents of the ray buffer, intersection buffer, vertex
    buffer, etc. until the command buffer has finished executing. Use the
    waitUntilCompleted or addCompletedHandler methods of the MTLCommandBuffer to
    block the CPU until the GPU has finished executing. Then retrieve the
    intersection results from the intersection buffer:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>typedef MPSIntersectionDistancePrimitiveIndexCoordinates Intersection;</pre>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>[commandBuffer waitUntilCompleted];
Intersection *intersections = (Intersection *)intersectionBuffer.contents;</pre>
<p class="Pp">There are also several choices of intersection data type
    controlled by the intersectionDataType property. The default intersection
    data type is <b>MPSIntersectionDistancePrimitiveIndexCoordinates</b>, which
    includes the intersection distance, primitive index, and barycentric
    coordinates. The other data types remove the primitive index or barycentric
    coordinates, which can be used to reduce the memory and memory bandwidth
    usage of the intersection buffer. These data types are available in the
    Metal Shading Language by including the
    MetalPerformanceShaders/MetalPerformanceShaders.h header.</p>
<p class="Pp">The intersection distance field is positive when an intersection
    has been found and negative when there is no intersection. When using the
    'nearest' intersection type, the intersection point is the ray origin plus
    the ray direction multiplied by the intersection distance. The other fields
    are not valid if there is no intersection. Only the intersection distance
    field is valid for the 'any' intersection type, and the distance is either a
    negative or positive value to indicate an intersection or miss. It does not
    necessarily contain the actual intersection distance when using the 'any'
    intersection type.</p>
<p class="Pp">Asynchronous Raytracing: Copying rays and intersections to and
    from the CPU is expensive. Furthermore, generating rays and consuming
    intersections on the CPU causes the CPU and GPU to block each other. If the
    CPU must generate rays and consume intersections, it is better to add an
    asynchronous completion handler to the MTLCommandBuffer. The CPU can then
    proceed to do other useful work and will be notified when the GPU has
    finished executing. Use double or triple buffered ray and intersection
    buffers to avoid race conditions such as the CPU overwriting data the GPU
    may be reading. Then the CPU can safely write to one range of the buffer
    while the GPU reads from another range of the buffer. Once the GPU is done
    executing, the CPU and GPU can advance to the next range of the buffer. This
    method can be implemented using a completion handler and a semaphore:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>#define MAX_ASYNC_OPERATIONS 3

// Create a semaphore with the maximum number of asynchronous operations in flight
dispatch_semaphore_t asyncOperationSemaphore = dispatch_semaphore_create(MAX_ASYNC_OPERATIONS);

<br/>
    dispatch_semaphore_signal(asyncOperationSemaphore);
}];

[commandBuffer commit];</pre>
<p class="Pp">GPU Driven Raytracing: Pipelining CPU and GPU work with
    asynchronous raytracing is better than allowing the CPU and GPU block each
    other, but it is even better to produce rays and consume intersections
    entirely on the GPU. This avoids the need to copy rays and intersections to
    and from the GPU and avoids any kind of CPU/GPU synchronization. To do this,
    encode compute kernels before and after intersection testing. By processing
    rays in parallel, the compute kernels may also be able to generate and
    consume rays faster than the CPU. The ray generation kernel typically
    produces rays according to some camera model, and the intersection
    consumption kernel typically updates the output buffer or texture according
    to some shading model.</p>
<p class="Pp">Since the rays and intersections will never leave the GPU, store
    them in private Metal buffers that are allocated in GPU memory rather than
    system memory. Because the ray generation, intersection testing, and
    intersection consumption kernels are pipelined on the GPU, there is no need
    to double or triple buffer the ray or intersection buffers, which saves
    memory.</p>

<p class="Pp">Note that the intersection consumption kernel can in turn produce
    new rays that can be passed back to the <b>MPSRayIntersector</b>. This
    technique can be used to implement iterative techniques such as progressive
    path tracing without leaving the GPU. For example, the shading kernel in the
    example above could produce both a secondary ray that will be passed back to
    the raytracer in the next iteration as well as a shadow ray that will be
    used to sample the direct lighting. <b>A</b> final kernel can consume the
    shadow ray intersections to accumulate lighting contributions into the
    framebuffer.</p>
<p class="Pp">There is an alternative version of the intersection test encoding
    method that does not accept a literal ray count. The ray count is instead
    fetched indirectly by the GPU. For example, this can be combined with a
    parallel reduction on the GPU to compact the ray buffer after each iteration
    as rays bounce out of the scene or are absorbed. Alternatively, setting the
    maximum distance of a ray to a negative number indicates that the ray has
    become inactive and causes the raytracer to ignore the ray.</p>

<p class="Pp">Multi-GPU Raytracing: to implement multi-GPU raytracing, create
    the <b>MPSRayIntersector</b> and <b>MPSAccelerationStructure</b> objects
    first with one Metal device and copy them to the other Metal device(s). The
    raytracing process can then proceed independently on each GPU. For example,
    divide the output image into tiles or slices that are rendered
    independently. Then composite finished tiles or slices back together on one
    GPU and present the output image to the screen. The workload should be
    distributed across GPUs according to their performance to avoid a more
    powerful GPU idly waiting for a less powerful GPU to finish.</p>
<p class="Pp">Acceleration Structure Serialization:
    <b>MPSAccelerationStructure</b> objects can be serialized and deserialized
    using the <b>NSSecureCoding</b> protocol. This can be used to build
    acceleration structures offline and reload them at runtime rather than
    building them from scratch.</p>
<p class="Pp">Performance Guidelines:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>- For vertex buffers, ray buffers, intersection buffers, etc., use private or managed
<br/>
  buffers rather than shared buffers when possible on discrete memory GPU architectures as
<br/>
  they are much faster than fetching data over the PCIe bus. If the CPU only writes once
<br/>
  to a ray buffer once and reads once from the intersection buffer, then a shared buffer may
<br/>
  be acceptable and avoids extra copies to and from the GPU. However, it is generally
<br/>
  preferable to generate and consume rays and intersections on the GPU instead, in which
<br/>
  case a private buffer should be used. Vertex data is typically static and reused many
<br/>
  times so it should be stored in private or managed buffers.
- If the CPU must generate and consume rays and intersections, use double or triple
<br/>
  buffering as described above. This avoids the CPU and GPU mutually blocking each other.
- In general, disable any unused features such as ray masks, backface culling,
<br/>
  etc. Enabling extra features increases the number of instructions and register usage of
<br/>
  the ray intersection kernel(s), reducing intersection performance. For example, it may be
<br/>
  more efficient to compute barycentric coordinates in your intersection consumption
<br/>
  kernel rather getting them from the raytracer. Use of an index buffer may also reduce
<br/>
  performance, so consider disabling the index buffer if there is enough memory available.
- Try to submit rays in large batches. This amortizes the costs involved in dispatching
<br/>
  work to the GPU and also allows the GPU to perform more effective latency hiding.
<br/>
  Use the recommendedMinimumRayBatchSizeForRayCount method to get an estimate of the
<br/>
  minimum recommended ray batch size. For this reason, small images or sample counts
<br/>
  may not perform as well as large images or sample counts. Note, however, that submitting
<br/>
  rays in very large batches can reduce the responsiveness of the system because the GPU
<br/>
  will be busy for long periods. Experiment to find a balance between raytracing throughput
<br/>
  and system responsiveness.
- When possible, organize rays within a batch for spatial locality. Rays that originate
<br/>
  at nearby points or are oriented in similar directions tend to access the same
<br/>
  locations in memory and can therefore make more effective use of the GPU's caches.
<br/>
  For example, the camera rays associated with nearby pixels in the output image will likely
<br/>
  originate at the same point and travel in very similar directions. Therefore, divide the
<br/>
  output image into small tiles (e.g., 8x8). Rather than laying out all of the rays in the
<br/>
  ray buffer in scanline order, first lay out the ray in scanline order within each tile,
<br/>
  then lay out the tiles in scanline order or according to some space filling curve.
- If CPU encode time is an issue, disable Metal API validation and enable
<br/>
  MPSKernelOptionsSkipAPIValidation.
- Choose the minimal ray and intersection data types for your use case. Loading and storing
<br/>
  extra values such as ray masks or triangle indices can reduce raytracing performance, so
<br/>
  use a simpler data type if they are not needed. For example, camera rays typically have no
<br/>
  need for a maximum distance field, while shadow rays do.
- Use MPSTriangleIntersectionTestTypeAny when possible: this is typically much faster than
<br/>
  MPSTriangleIntersectionTestTypeNearest and can be used when you only need to check for
<br/>
  binary visibility between two points such as shadow and ambient occlusion rays. Combine
<br/>
  this with MPSRayDataTypeDistance to minimize memory bandwidth usage.
- Try to keep the geometry, textures, ray buffers, etc. within the Metal device's
<br/>
  recommended working set size. Paging data into GPU memory can significantly reduce
<br/>
  raytracing performance.
- Changes to MPSRayIntersector properties can trigger internal pipeline compilations when
<br/>
  intersection tests are next encoded. If you need to avoid hitches due to pipeline
<br/>
  compilation, encode a small ray intersection with each raytracer configuration you will
<br/>
  use at encode-time. This creates and caches the corresponding pipelines.
- Disable rays which should not participate in intersection testing. This can be done either
<br/>
  by compacting the ray buffer such that it only contains valid rays, or by setting fields
<br/>
  of the ray struct to invalid values. For example, setting the maximum distance to a
<br/>
  negative value, setting the mask to zero, setting the direction to the zero vector, etc.
<br/>
  In particular, rays should NOT be disabled using schemes such as moving their origin
<br/>
  outside the scene. These rays will still partially traverse the acceleration structure,
<br/>
  potentially evicting data from the cache which could have been used by valid rays. Note
<br/>
  that it is preferable to provide only valid rays so that threads are not left idle if
<br/>
  their rays are found to be invalid, but it can be convenient to disable rays in place in

<p class="Pp">Get the recommended minimum number of rays to submit for
    intersection in one batch. In order to keep the system responsive, and to
    limit the amount of memory allocated to ray and intersection buffers, it may
    be desirable to divide the rays to be intersected against an acceleration
    structure into smaller batches. However, submitting too few rays in a batch
    reduces GPU utilization and performance. This method provides a recommended
    minimum number of rays to submit in any given batch. For example, for a
    1920x1080 image, this method may recommend that the image be divided into
    512x512 tiles. The actual recommendation varies per device and total ray
    count.</p>

    is associated with a 32 bit unsigned integer mask. Before checking for
    intersection between a ray and a primitive or instance, the corresponding
    masks are logically AND-ed together. If the result is zero, the intersection
    is skipped.</p>
<p class="Pp">This can be used to make certain primitives or instances invisible
    to certain rays. For example, objects can be grouped into layers and their
    visibility can be toggled by modifying the ray masks rather than removing
    the objects from the scene and rebuilding the acceleration structure.
    Alternatively, certain objects can be prevented from casting shadows by
    making them invisible to shadow rays.</p>
