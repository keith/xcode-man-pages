   Set up some character translations and predefined strings.  \*(-- will
   give an unbreakable dash, \*(PI will give pi, \*(L" will give a left
   double quote, and \*(R" will give a right double quote.  \*(C+ will
   give a nicer C++.  Capital omega is used to do unbreakable dashes and
   therefore won't be available.  \*(C` and \*(C' expand to `' in nroff,
   nothing in troff, for use with C<>.

Since the VMS linker distinguishes symbols based only on the first 31 characters
  of their names, it is occasionally necessary to shorten symbol names in order
  to avoid collisions. (This is especially true of names generated by xsubpp,
  since prefixes generated by nested package names can become quite long.)
  <span class="Li">&quot;ExtUtils::XSSymSet&quot;</span> provides functions to
  shorten names in a consistent fashion, and to track a set of names to insure
  that each is unique. While designed with <i>xsubpp</i> in mind, it may be used
  with any set of strings.
<p class="Pp">This package supplies the following functions, all of which should
    be called as methods.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>new([$maxlen[,$silent]])</dt>
  <dd>Creates an empty <span class="Li">&quot;ExtUtils::XSSymset&quot;</span>
      set of symbols. This function may be called as a static method or via an
      existing object. If <span class="Li">$maxlen</span> or
      <span class="Li">$silent</span> are specified, they are used as the
      defaults for maximum name length and warning behavior in future calls to
      <b>addsym()</b> or <b>trimsym()</b> via this object. If the compiler has
      been instructed to do its own symbol shortening via
      <span class="Li">$Config{'useshortenedsymbols'}</span>, a value of 2048 is
      assumed for <span class="Li">$maxlen</span> as a way of bypassing the
      shortening done by this module.</dd>
  <dt>addsym($name[,$maxlen[,$silent]])</dt>
  <dd>Creates a symbol name from <span class="Li">$name</span>, using the
      methods described under <b>trimsym()</b>, which is unique in this set of
      symbols, and returns the new name. <span class="Li">$name</span> and its
      resultant are added to the set, and any future calls to <b>addsym()</b>
      specifying the same <span class="Li">$name</span> will return the same
      result, regardless of the value of <span class="Li">$maxlen</span>
      specified. Unless <span class="Li">$silent</span> is true, warnings are
      output if <span class="Li">$name</span> had to be trimmed or changed in
      order to avoid collision with an existing symbol name.
      <span class="Li">$maxlen</span> and <span class="Li">$silent</span>
      default to the values specified when this set of symbols was created. This
      method must be called via an existing object.</dd>
  <dt>trimsym($name[,$maxlen[,$silent]])</dt>
  <dd>Creates a symbol name <span class="Li">$maxlen</span> or fewer characters
      long from <span class="Li">$name</span> and returns it. If
      <span class="Li">$name</span> is too long, it first tries to shorten it by
      removing duplicate characters, then by periodically removing
      non-underscore characters, and finally, if necessary, by periodically
      removing characters of any type. <span class="Li">$maxlen</span> defaults
      to 31. Unless <span class="Li">$silent</span> is true, a warning is output
      if <span class="Li">$name</span> is altered in any way. This function may
      be called either as a static method or via an existing object, but in the
      latter case no check is made to insure that the resulting name is unique
      in the set of symbols. If the compiler has been instructed to do its own
      symbol shortening via
      <span class="Li">$Config{'useshortenedsymbols'}</span>, a value of 2048 is
      assumed for <span class="Li">$maxlen</span> as a way of bypassing the
      shortening done by this module.</dd>
  <dt>delsym($name)</dt>
  <dd>Removes <span class="Li">$name</span> from the set of symbols, where
      <span class="Li">$name</span> is the original symbol name passed
      previously to <b>addsym()</b>. If <span class="Li">$name</span> existed in
      the set of symbols, returns its &quot;trimmed&quot; equivalent, otherwise
      returns <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span>. This method must be
      called via an existing object.</dd>
  <dt>get_orig($trimmed)</dt>
  <dd>Returns the original name which was trimmed to
      <span class="Li">$trimmed</span> by a previous call to <b>addsym()</b>, or
      <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> if
      <span class="Li">$trimmed</span> does not correspond to a member of this
      set of symbols. This method must be called via an existing object.</dd>
  <dt>get_trimmed($name)</dt>
  <dd>Returns the trimmed name which was generated from
      <span class="Li">$name</span> by a previous call to <b>addsym()</b>, or
      <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> if <span class="Li">$name</span>
      is not a member of this set of symbols. This method must be called via an
      existing object.</dd>
  <dt><b>all_orig()</b></dt>
  <dd>Returns a list containing all of the original symbol names from this
    set.</dd>
  <dt><b>all_trimmed()</b></dt>
  <dd>Returns a list containing all of the trimmed symbol names from this
    set.</dd>
