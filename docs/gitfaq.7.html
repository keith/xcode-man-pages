<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The examples in this FAQ assume a standard POSIX shell, like
    <b>bash</b> or <b>dash</b>, and a user, A U Thor, who has the account
    <b>author</b> on the hosting provider <b>git.example.org</b>.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="CONFIGURATION"><a class="permalink" href="#CONFIGURATION">CONFIGURATION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">What should I put in <b>user.name</b>?</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">You should put your personal name, generally a form using
  a given name and family name. For example, the current maintainer of Git uses
  &quot;Junio C Hamano&quot;. This will be the name portion that is stored in
  every commit you make.
<p class="Pp">This configuration doesn&#x2019;t have any effect on
    authenticating to remote services; for that, see <b>credential.username</b>
    in <b>git-config</b>(1).</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">What does <b>http.postBuffer</b> really do?</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This option changes the size of the buffer that Git uses
  when pushing data to a remote over HTTP or HTTPS. If the data is larger than
  this size, libcurl, which handles the HTTP support for Git, will use chunked
  transfer encoding since it isn&#x2019;t known ahead of time what the size of
  the pushed data will be.
<p class="Pp">Leaving this value at the default size is fine unless you know
    that either the remote server or a proxy in the middle doesn&#x2019;t
    support HTTP/1.1 (which introduced the chunked transfer encoding) or is
    known to be broken with chunked data. This is often (erroneously) suggested
    as a solution for generic push problems, but since almost every server and
    proxy supports at least HTTP/1.1, raising this value usually doesn&#x2019;t
    solve most push problems. A server or proxy that didn&#x2019;t correctly
    support HTTP/1.1 and chunked transfer encoding wouldn&#x2019;t be that
    useful on the Internet today, since it would break lots of traffic.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that increasing this value will increase the memory used on
    every relevant push that Git does over HTTP or HTTPS, since the entire
    buffer is allocated regardless of whether or not it is all used. Thus,
    it&#x2019;s best to leave it at the default unless you are sure you need a
    different value.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">How do I configure a different editor?</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If you haven&#x2019;t specified an editor specifically
  for Git, it will by default use the editor you&#x2019;ve configured using the
  <b>VISUAL</b> or <b>EDITOR</b> environment variables, or if neither is
  specified, the system default (which is usually <b>vi</b>). Since some people
  find <b>vi</b> difficult to use or prefer a different editor, it may be
  desirable to change the editor used.
<p class="Pp">If you want to configure a general editor for most programs which
    need one, you can edit your shell configuration (e.g., <b>~/.bashrc</b> or
    <b>~/.zshenv</b>) to contain a line setting the <b>EDITOR</b> or
    <b>VISUAL</b> environment variable to an appropriate value. For example, if
    you prefer the editor <b>nano</b>, then you could write the following:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>export VISUAL=nano</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">If you want to configure an editor specifically for Git, you can
    either set the <b>core.editor</b> configuration value or the
    <b>GIT_EDITOR</b> environment variable. You can see <b>git-var</b>(1) for
    details on the order in which these options are consulted.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that in all cases, the editor value will be passed to the
    shell, so any arguments containing spaces should be appropriately quoted.
    Additionally, if your editor normally detaches from the terminal when
    invoked, you should specify it with an argument that makes it not do that,
    or else Git will not see any changes. An example of a configuration
    addressing both of these issues on Windows would be the configuration
    <b>&quot;C:\Program Files\Vim\gvim.exe&quot; --nofork</b>, which quotes the
    filename with spaces and specifies the <b>--nofork</b> option to avoid
    backgrounding the process.</p>
</div>

<h1 class="Sh" id="CREDENTIALS"><a class="permalink" href="#CREDENTIALS">CREDENTIALS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">How do I specify my credentials when pushing over HTTP?</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The easiest way to do this is to use a credential helper
  via the <b>credential.helper</b> configuration. Most systems provide a
  standard choice to integrate with the system credential manager. For example,
  Git for Windows provides the <b>wincred</b> credential manager, macOS has the
  <b>osxkeychain</b> credential manager, and Unix systems with a standard
  desktop environment can use the <b>libsecret</b> credential manager. All of
  these store credentials in an encrypted store to keep your passwords or tokens
  secure.
<p class="Pp">In addition, you can use the <b>store</b> credential manager which
    stores in a file in your home directory, or the <b>cache</b> credential
    manager, which does not permanently store your credentials, but does prevent
    you from being prompted for them for a certain period of time.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can also just enter your password when prompted. While it is
    possible to place the password (which must be percent-encoded) in the URL,
    this is not particularly secure and can lead to accidental exposure of
    credentials, so it is not recommended.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">How do I read a password or token from an environment
  variable?</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The <b>credential.helper</b> configuration option can
  also take an arbitrary shell command that produces the credential protocol on
  standard output. This is useful when passing credentials into a container, for
  example.
<p class="Pp">Such a shell command can be specified by starting the option value
    with an exclamation point. If your password or token were stored in the
    <b>GIT_TOKEN</b>, you could run the following command to set your credential
    helper:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ git config credential.helper \
<br/>
        '!f() { echo username=author; echo &quot;password=$GIT_TOKEN&quot;; };f'</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">How do I change the password or token I&#x2019;ve saved in my
    credential manager?</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Usually, if the password or token is invalid, Git will
  erase it and prompt for a new one. However, there are times when this
  doesn&#x2019;t always happen. To change the password or token, you can erase
  the existing credentials and then Git will prompt for new ones. To erase
  credentials, use a syntax like the following (substituting your username and
  the hostname):
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ echo url=https://author@git.example.org | git credential reject</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">How do I use multiple accounts with the same hosting provider
    using HTTP?</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Usually the easiest way to distinguish between these
  accounts is to use the username in the URL. For example, if you have the
  accounts <b>author</b> and <b>committer</b> on <b>git.example.org</b>, you can
  use the URLs <b>https://author@git.example.org/org1/project1.git</b> and
  <b>https://committer@git.example.org/org2/project2.git</b>. This way, when you
  use a credential helper, it will automatically try to look up the correct
  credentials for your account. If you already have a remote set up, you can
  change the URL with something like <b>git remote set-url origin
  https://author@git.example.org/org1/project1.git</b> (see <b>git-remote</b>(1)
  for details).</div>
<p class="Pp">How do I use multiple accounts with the same hosting provider
    using SSH?</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">With most hosting providers that support SSH, a single
  key pair uniquely identifies a user. Therefore, to use multiple accounts,
  it&#x2019;s necessary to create a key pair for each account. If you&#x2019;re
  using a reasonably modern OpenSSH version, you can create a new key pair with
  something like <b>ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/id_committer</b>. You can
  then register the public key (in this case, <b>~/.ssh/id_committer.pub</b>;
  note the <b>.pub</b>) with the hosting provider.
<p class="Pp">Most hosting providers use a single SSH account for pushing; that
    is, all users push to the <b>git</b> account (e.g.,
    <b>git@git.example.org</b>). If that&#x2019;s the case for your provider,
    you can set up multiple aliases in SSH to make it clear which key pair to
    use. For example, you could write something like the following in
    <b>~/.ssh/config</b>, substituting the proper private key file:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre># This is the account for author on git.example.org.
Host example_author
<br/>
        HostName git.example.org
<br/>
        User git
<br/>
        # This is the key pair registered for author with git.example.org.
<br/>
        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_author
<br/>
        IdentitiesOnly yes
# This is the account for committer on git.example.org.
Host example_committer
<br/>
        HostName git.example.org
<br/>
        User git
<br/>
        # This is the key pair registered for committer with git.example.org.
<br/>
        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_committer
<br/>
        IdentitiesOnly yes</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Then, you can adjust your push URL to use
    <b>git@example_author</b> or <b>git@example_committer</b> instead of
    <b>git@example.org</b> (e.g., <b>git remote set-url
    git@example_author:org1/project1.git</b>).</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="COMMON_ISSUES"><a class="permalink" href="#COMMON_ISSUES">COMMON
  ISSUES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">I&#x2019;ve made a mistake in the last commit. How do I change
  it?</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">You can make the appropriate change to your working tree,
  run <b>git add &lt;file&gt;</b> or <b>git rm &lt;file&gt;</b>, as appropriate,
  to stage it, and then <b>git commit --amend</b>. Your change will be included
  in the commit, and you&#x2019;ll be prompted to edit the commit message again;
  if you wish to use the original message verbatim, you can use the
  <b>--no-edit</b> option to <b>git commit</b> in addition, or just save and
  quit when your editor opens.</div>
<p class="Pp">I&#x2019;ve made a change with a bug and it&#x2019;s been included
    in the main branch. How should I undo it?</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The usual way to deal with this is to use <b>git
  revert</b>. This preserves the history that the original change was made and
  was a valuable contribution, but also introduces a new commit that undoes
  those changes because the original had a problem. The commit message of the
  revert indicates the commit which was reverted and is usually edited to
  include an explanation as to why the revert was made.</div>
<p class="Pp">How do I ignore changes to a tracked file?</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Git doesn&#x2019;t provide a way to do this. The reason
  is that if Git needs to overwrite this file, such as during a checkout, it
  doesn&#x2019;t know whether the changes to the file are precious and should be
  kept, or whether they are irrelevant and can safely be destroyed. Therefore,
  it has to take the safe route and always preserve them.
<p class="Pp">It&#x2019;s tempting to try to use certain features of <b>git
    update-index</b>, namely the assume-unchanged and skip-worktree bits, but
    these don&#x2019;t work properly for this purpose and shouldn&#x2019;t be
    used this way.</p>
<p class="Pp">If your goal is to modify a configuration file, it can often be
    helpful to have a file checked into the repository which is a template or
    set of defaults which can then be copied alongside and modified as
    appropriate. This second, modified file is usually ignored to prevent
    accidentally committing it.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">I asked Git to ignore various files, yet they are still
  tracked</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A <b>gitignore</b> file ensures that certain file(s)
  which are not tracked by Git remain untracked. However, sometimes particular
  file(s) may have been tracked before adding them into the <b>.gitignore</b>,
  hence they still remain tracked. To untrack and ignore files/patterns, use
  <b>git rm --cached &lt;file/pattern&gt;</b> and add a pattern to
  <b>.gitignore</b> that matches the &lt;file&gt;. See <b>gitignore</b>(5) for
  details.</div>
<p class="Pp">How do I know if I want to do a fetch or a pull?</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A fetch stores a copy of the latest changes from the
  remote repository, without modifying the working tree or current branch. You
  can then at your leisure inspect, merge, rebase on top of, or ignore the
  upstream changes. A pull consists of a fetch followed immediately by either a
  merge or rebase. See <b>git-pull</b>(1).</div>

<h1 class="Sh" id="MERGING_AND_REBASING"><a class="permalink" href="#MERGING_AND_REBASING">MERGING
  AND REBASING</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">What kinds of problems can occur when merging long-lived branches
    with squash merges?</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">In general, there are a variety of problems that can
  occur when using squash merges to merge two branches multiple times. These can
  include seeing extra commits in <b>git log</b> output, with a GUI, or when
  using the <b>...</b> notation to express a range, as well as the possibility
  of needing to re-resolve conflicts again and again.
<p class="Pp">When Git does a normal merge between two branches, it considers
    exactly three points: the two branches and a third commit, called the
    <i>merge base</i>, which is usually the common ancestor of the commits. The
    result of the merge is the sum of the changes between the merge base and
    each head. When you merge two branches with a regular merge commit, this
    results in a new commit which will end up as a merge base when
    they&#x2019;re merged again, because there is now a new common ancestor. Git
    doesn&#x2019;t have to consider changes that occurred before the merge base,
    so you don&#x2019;t have to re-resolve any conflicts you resolved
  before.</p>
<p class="Pp">When you perform a squash merge, a merge commit isn&#x2019;t
    created; instead, the changes from one side are applied as a regular commit
    to the other side. This means that the merge base for these branches
    won&#x2019;t have changed, and so when Git goes to perform its next merge,
    it considers all of the changes that it considered the last time plus the
    new changes. That means any conflicts may need to be re-resolved. Similarly,
    anything using the <b>...</b> notation in <b>git diff</b>, <b>git log</b>,
    or a GUI will result in showing all of the changes since the original merge
    base.</p>
<p class="Pp">As a consequence, if you want to merge two long-lived branches
    repeatedly, it&#x2019;s best to always use a regular merge commit.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">If I make a change on two branches but revert it on one, why does
    the merge of those branches include the change?</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">By default, when Git does a merge, it uses a strategy
  called the recursive strategy, which does a fancy three-way merge. In such a
  case, when Git performs the merge, it considers exactly three points: the two
  heads and a third point, called the <i>merge base</i>, which is usually the
  common ancestor of those commits. Git does not consider the history or the
  individual commits that have happened on those branches at all.
<p class="Pp">As a result, if both sides have a change and one side has reverted
    that change, the result is to include the change. This is because the code
    has changed on one side and there is no net change on the other, and in this
    scenario, Git adopts the change.</p>
<p class="Pp">If this is a problem for you, you can do a rebase instead,
    rebasing the branch with the revert onto the other branch. A rebase in this
    scenario will revert the change, because a rebase applies each individual
    commit, including the revert. Note that rebases rewrite history, so you
    should avoid rebasing published branches unless you&#x2019;re sure
    you&#x2019;re comfortable with that. See the NOTES section in
    <b>git-rebase</b>(1) for more details.</p>
</div>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="HOOKS"><a class="permalink" href="#HOOKS">HOOKS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">How do I use hooks to prevent users from making certain
  changes?</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The only safe place to make these changes is on the
  remote repository (i.e., the Git server), usually in the <b>pre-receive</b>
  hook or in a continuous integration (CI) system. These are the locations in
  which policy can be enforced effectively.
<p class="Pp">It&#x2019;s common to try to use <b>pre-commit</b> hooks (or, for
    commit messages, <b>commit-msg</b> hooks) to check these things, which is
    great if you&#x2019;re working as a solo developer and want the tooling to
    help you. However, using hooks on a developer machine is not effective as a
    policy control because a user can bypass these hooks with <b>--no-verify</b>
    without being noticed (among various other ways). Git assumes that the user
    is in control of their local repositories and doesn&#x2019;t try to prevent
    this or tattle on the user.</p>
<p class="Pp">In addition, some advanced users find <b>pre-commit</b> hooks to
    be an impediment to workflows that use temporary commits to stage work in
    progress or that create fixup commits, so it&#x2019;s better to push these
    kinds of checks to the server anyway.</p>
</div>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="CROSS"><a class="permalink" href="#CROSS">CROSS-PLATFORM
  ISSUES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">I&#x2019;m on Windows and my text files are detected as
  binary.</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Git works best when you store text files as UTF-8. Many
  programs on Windows support UTF-8, but some do not and only use the
  little-endian UTF-16 format, which Git detects as binary. If you can&#x2019;t
  use UTF-8 with your programs, you can specify a working tree encoding that
  indicates which encoding your files should be checked out with, while still
  storing these files as UTF-8 in the repository. This allows tools like
  <b>git-diff</b>(1) to work as expected, while still allowing your tools to
  work.
<p class="Pp">To do so, you can specify a <b>gitattributes</b>(5) pattern with
    the <b>working-tree-encoding</b> attribute. For example, the following
    pattern sets all C files to use UTF-16LE-BOM, which is a common encoding on
    Windows:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>*.c     working-tree-encoding=UTF-16LE-BOM</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">You will need to run <b>git add --renormalize</b> to have this
    take effect. Note that if you are making these changes on a project that is
    used across platforms, you&#x2019;ll probably want to make it in a per-user
    configuration file or in the one in <b>$GIT_DIR/info/attributes</b>, since
    making it in a <b>.gitattributes</b> file in the repository will apply to
    all users of the repository.</p>
<p class="Pp">See the following entry for information about normalizing line
    endings as well, and see <b>gitattributes</b>(5) for more information about
    attribute files.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">I&#x2019;m on Windows and git diff shows my files as having a
    <b>^M</b> at the end.</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">By default, Git expects files to be stored with Unix line
  endings. As such, the carriage return (<b>^M</b>) that is part of a Windows
  line ending is shown because it is considered to be trailing whitespace. Git
  defaults to showing trailing whitespace only on new lines, not existing ones.
<p class="Pp">You can store the files in the repository with Unix line endings
    and convert them automatically to your platform&#x2019;s line endings. To do
    that, set the configuration option <b>core.eol</b> to <b>native</b> and see
    the following entry for information about how to configure files as text or
    binary.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can also control this behavior with the <b>core.whitespace</b>
    setting if you don&#x2019;t wish to remove the carriage returns from your
    line endings.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Why do I have a file that&#x2019;s always modified?</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Internally, Git always stores file names as sequences of
  bytes and doesn&#x2019;t perform any encoding or case folding. However,
  Windows and macOS by default both perform case folding on file names. As a
  result, it&#x2019;s possible to end up with multiple files or directories
  whose names differ only in case. Git can handle this just fine, but the file
  system can store only one of these files, so when Git reads the other file to
  see its contents, it looks modified.
<p class="Pp">It&#x2019;s best to remove one of the files such that you only
    have one file. You can do this with commands like the following (assuming
    two files <b>AFile.txt</b> and <b>afile.txt</b>) on an otherwise clean
    working tree:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ git rm --cached AFile.txt
$ git commit -m 'Remove files conflicting in case'
$ git checkout .</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">This avoids touching the disk, but removes the additional file.
    Your project may prefer to adopt a naming convention, such as all-lowercase
    names, to avoid this problem from occurring again; such a convention can be
    checked using a <b>pre-receive</b> hook or as part of a continuous
    integration (CI) system.</p>
<p class="Pp">It is also possible for perpetually modified files to occur on any
    platform if a smudge or clean filter is in use on your system but a file was
    previously committed without running the smudge or clean filter. To fix
    this, run the following on an otherwise clean working tree:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ git add --renormalize .</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">What&#x2019;s the recommended way to store files in Git?</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">While Git can store and handle any file of any type,
  there are some settings that work better than others. In general, we recommend
  that text files be stored in UTF-8 without a byte-order mark (BOM) with LF
  (Unix-style) endings. We also recommend the use of UTF-8 (again, without BOM)
  in commit messages. These are the settings that work best across platforms and
  with tools such as <b>git diff</b> and <b>git merge</b>.
<p class="Pp">Additionally, if you have a choice between storage formats that
    are text based or non-text based, we recommend storing files in the text
    format and, if necessary, transforming them into the other format. For
    example, a text-based SQL dump with one record per line will work much
    better for diffing and merging than an actual database file. Similarly,
    text-based formats such as Markdown and AsciiDoc will work better than
    binary formats such as Microsoft Word and PDF.</p>
<p class="Pp">Similarly, storing binary dependencies (e.g., shared libraries or
    JAR files) or build products in the repository is generally not recommended.
    Dependencies and build products are best stored on an artifact or package
    server with only references, URLs, and hashes stored in the repository.</p>
<p class="Pp">We also recommend setting a <b>gitattributes</b>(5) file to
    explicitly mark which files are text and which are binary. If you want Git
    to guess, you can set the attribute <b>text=auto</b>. For example, the
    following might be appropriate in some projects:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre># By default, guess.
*       text=auto
# Mark all C files as text.
*.c     text
# Mark all JPEG files as binary.
*.jpg   binary</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">These settings help tools pick the right format for output such as
    patches and result in files being checked out in the appropriate line ending
    for the platform.</p>
