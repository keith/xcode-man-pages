slapd-config - configuration backend to slapd

The <b>config</b> backend manages all of the configuration information for the
  <b>slapd</b>(8) daemon. This configuration information is also used by the
  SLAPD tools <b>slapacl</b>(8), <b>slapadd</b>(8), <b>slapauth</b>(8),
  <b>slapcat</b>(8), <b>slapdn</b>(8), <b>slapindex</b>(8), and
  <b>slaptest</b>(8).
<p class="Pp">The <b>config</b> backend is backward compatible with the older
    <b>slapd.conf</b>(5) file but provides the ability to change the
    configuration dynamically at runtime. If slapd is run with only a
    <b>slapd.conf</b> file dynamic changes will be allowed but they will not
    persist across a server restart. Dynamic changes are only saved when slapd
    is running from a <b>slapd.d</b> configuration directory.</p>
<p class="Pp">Unlike other backends, there can only be one instance of the
    <b>config</b> backend, and most of its structure is predefined. The root of
    the database is hardcoded to <b>cn=config</b> and this root entry contains
    global settings for slapd. Multiple child entries underneath the root entry
    are used to carry various other settings:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>cn=Module</b></dt>
  <dd>dynamically loaded modules</dd>
  <dt><b>cn=Schema</b></dt>
  <dd>schema definitions</dd>
  <dt><b>olcBackend=xxx</b></dt>
  <dd>backend-specific settings</dd>
  <dt><b>olcDatabase=xxx</b></dt>
  <dd>database-specific settings</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The <b>cn=Module</b> entries will only appear in configurations
    where slapd was built with support for dynamically loaded modules. There can
    be multiple entries, one for each configured module path. Within each entry
    there will be values recorded for each module loaded on a given path. These
    entries have no children.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>cn=Schema</b> entry contains all of the hardcoded schema
    elements. The children of this entry contain all user-defined schema
    elements. In schema that were loaded from include files, the child entry
    will be named after the include file from which the schema was loaded.
    Typically the first child in this subtree will be
    <b>cn=core,cn=schema,cn=config</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>olcBackend</b> entries are for storing settings specific to a
    single backend type (and thus global to all database instances of that
    type). At present there are no backends that implement settings of this
    nature, so usually there will not be any olcBackend entries.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>olcDatabase</b> entries store settings specific to a single
    database instance. These entries may have <b>olcOverlay</b> child entries
    corresponding to any overlays configured on the database. The olcDatabase
    and olcOverlay entries may also have miscellaneous child entries for other
    settings as needed. There are two special database entries that are
    predefined - one is an entry for the config database itself, and the other
    is for the &quot;frontend&quot; database. Settings in the frontend database
    are inherited by the other databases, unless they are explicitly overridden
    in a specific database.</p>
<p class="Pp">The specific configuration options available are discussed below
    in the Global Configuration Options, General Backend Options, and General
    Database Options. Options are set by defining LDAP attributes with specific
    values. In general the names of the LDAP attributes are the same as the
    corresponding <b>slapd.conf</b> keyword, with an &quot;olc&quot; prefix
    added on.</p>
<p class="Pp">The parser for many of these attributes is the same as used for
    parsing the slapd.conf keywords. As such, slapd.conf keywords that allow
    multiple items to be specified on one line, separated by whitespace, will
    allow multiple items to be specified in one attribute value. However, when
    reading the attribute via LDAP, the items will be returned as individual
    attribute values.</p>
<p class="Pp">Backend-specific options are discussed in the
    <b>slapd-&lt;backend&gt;(5)</b> manual pages. Refer to the &quot;OpenLDAP
    Administrator's Guide&quot; for more details on configuring slapd.</p>

Options described in this section apply to the server as a whole. Arguments that
  should be replaced by actual text are shown in brackets &lt;&gt;.
<p class="Pp">These options may only be specified in the <b>cn=config</b> entry.
    This entry must have an objectClass of <b>olcGlobal</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>olcAllows: &lt;features&gt;</b></dt>
  <dd>Specify a set of features to allow (default none). <b>bind_v2</b> allows
      acceptance of LDAPv2 bind requests. Note that <b>slapd</b>(8) does not
      truly implement LDAPv2 (RFC 1777), now Historic (RFC 3494).
      <b>bind_anon_cred</b> allows anonymous bind when credentials are not empty
      (e.g. when DN is empty). <b>bind_anon_dn</b> allows unauthenticated
      (anonymous) bind when DN is not empty. <b>update_anon</b> allows
      unauthenticated (anonymous) update operations to be processed (subject to
      access controls and other administrative limits). <b>proxy_authz_anon</b>
      allows unauthenticated (anonymous) proxy authorization control to be
      processed (subject to access controls, authorization and other
      administrative limits).</dd>
  <dt><b>olcArgsFile: &lt;filename&gt;</b></dt>
  <dd>The (absolute) name of a file that will hold the <b>slapd</b> server's
      command line (program name and options).</dd>
  <dt><b>olcAttributeOptions: &lt;option-name&gt;...</b></dt>
  <dd>Define tagging attribute options or option tag/range prefixes. Options
      must not end with `-', prefixes must end with `-'. The `lang-' prefix is
      predefined. If you use the <b>olcAttributeOptions</b> directive, `lang-'
      will no longer be defined and you must specify it explicitly if you want
      it defined.
    <p class="Pp">An attribute description with a tagging option is a subtype of
        that attribute description without the option. Except for that, options
        defined this way have no special semantics. Prefixes defined this way
        work like the `lang-' options: They define a prefix for tagging options
        starting with the prefix. That is, if you define the prefix `x-foo-',
        you can use the option `x-foo-bar'. Furthermore, in a search or compare,
        a prefix or range name (with a trailing `-') matches all options
        starting with that name, as well as the option with the range name sans
        the trailing `-'. That is, `x-foo-bar-' matches `x-foo-bar' and
        `x-foo-bar-baz'.</p>
    <p class="Pp">RFC 4520 reserves options beginning with `x-' for private
        experiments. Other options should be registered with IANA, see RFC 4520
        section 3.5. OpenLDAP also has the `binary' option built in, but this is
        a transfer option, not a tagging option.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>olcAuthIDRewrite: &lt;rewrite-rule&gt;</b></dt>
  <dd>Used by the authentication framework to convert simple user names to an
      LDAP DN used for authorization purposes. Its purpose is analogous to that
      of <b>olcAuthzRegexp</b> (see below). The <b>rewrite-rule</b> is a set of
      rules analogous to those described in <b>slapo-rwm</b>(5) for data
      rewriting (after stripping the <i>rwm-</i> prefix).
      <b>olcAuthIDRewrite</b> and <b>olcAuthzRegexp</b> should not be
      intermixed.</dd>
  <dt><b>olcAuthzPolicy: &lt;policy&gt;</b></dt>
  <dd>Used to specify which rules to use for Proxy Authorization. Proxy
      authorization allows a client to authenticate to the server using one
      user's credentials, but specify a different identity to use for
      authorization and access control purposes. It essentially allows user A to
      login as user B, using user A's password. The <b>none</b> flag disables
      proxy authorization. This is the default setting. The <b>from</b> flag
      will use rules in the <i>authzFrom</i> attribute of the authorization DN.
      The <b>to</b> flag will use rules in the <i>authzTo</i> attribute of the
      authentication DN. The <b>any</b> flag, an alias for the deprecated value
      of <b>both</b>, will allow any of the above, whatever succeeds first
      (checked in <b>to</b>, <b>from</b> sequence. The <b>all</b> flag requires
      both authorizations to succeed.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The rules are mechanisms to specify which identities are
  allowed to perform proxy authorization. The <i>authzFrom</i> attribute in an
  entry specifies which other users are allowed to proxy login to this entry.
  The <i>authzTo</i> attribute in an entry specifies which other users this user
  can authorize as. Use of <i>authzTo</i> rules can be easily abused if users
  are allowed to write arbitrary values to this attribute. In general the
  <i>authzTo</i> attribute must be protected with ACLs such that only privileged
  users can modify it. The value of <i>authzFrom</i> and <i>authzTo</i>
  describes an <b>identity</b> or a set of identities; it can take five forms:
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>ldap:///&lt;base&gt;??[&lt;scope&gt;]?&lt;filter&gt;</b></dt>
  <dd></dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="Bd-indent"><b>dn[.&lt;dnstyle&gt;]:&lt;pattern&gt;</b></div>
<div class="Bd-indent"><b>u[&lt;mech&gt;[&lt;realm&gt;]]:&lt;pattern&gt;</b></div>
<div class="Bd-indent"><b>group[/objectClass[/attributeType]]:&lt;pattern&gt;</b></div>
<div class="Bd-indent"><b>&lt;pattern&gt;</b></div>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp"><b>&lt;dnstyle&gt;:={exact|onelevel|children|subtree|regex}</b></p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
</div>
The first form is a valid LDAP <b>URI</b> where the
  <i>&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;</i>, the <i>&lt;attrs&gt;</i> and the
  <i>&lt;extensions&gt;</i> portions must be absent, so that the search occurs
  locally on either <i>authzFrom</i> or <i>authzTo</i>. The second form is a
  <b>DN</b>, with the optional style modifiers <i>exact</i>, <i>onelevel</i>,
  <i>children</i>, and <i>subtree</i> for exact, onelevel, children and subtree
  matches, which cause <i>&lt;pattern&gt;</i> to be normalized according to the
  DN normalization rules, or the special <i>regex</i> style, which causes the
  <i>&lt;pattern&gt;</i> to be treated as a POSIX (''extended'') regular
  expression, as discussed in <b>regex</b>(7) and/or <b>re_format</b>(7). A
  pattern of <i>*</i> means any non-anonymous DN. The third form is a SASL
  <b>id</b>, with the optional fields <i>&lt;mech&gt;</i> and
  <i>&lt;realm&gt;</i> that allow to specify a SASL <b>mechanism</b>, and
  eventually a SASL <b>realm</b>, for those mechanisms that support one. The
  need to allow the specification of a mechanism is still debated, and users are
  strongly discouraged to rely on this possibility. The fourth form is a group
  specification, consisting of the keyword <b>group</b>, optionally followed by
  the specification of the group <b>objectClass</b> and member
  <b>attributeType</b>. The group with DN <b>&lt;pattern&gt;</b> is searched
  with base scope, and in case of match, the values of the member
  <b>attributeType</b> are searched for the asserted DN. For backwards
  compatibility, if no identity type is provided, i.e. only
  <b>&lt;pattern&gt;</b> is present, an <i>exact DN</i> is assumed; as a
  consequence, <b>&lt;pattern&gt;</b> is subjected to DN normalization. Since
  the interpretation of <i>authzFrom</i> and <i>authzTo</i> can impact security,
  users are strongly encouraged to explicitly set the type of identity
  specification that is being used. A subset of these rules can be used as third
  arg in the <b>olcAuthzRegexp</b> statement (see below); significantly, the
  <i>URI</i> and the <i>dn.exact:&lt;dn&gt;</i> forms.</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>olcAuthzRegexp: &lt;match&gt; &lt;replace&gt;</b></dt>
  <dd>Used by the authentication framework to convert simple user names, such as
      provided by SASL subsystem, to an LDAP DN used for authorization purposes.
      Note that the resultant DN need not refer to an existing entry to be
      considered valid. When an authorization request is received from the SASL
      subsystem, the SASL <b>USERNAME</b>, <b>REALM</b>, and <b>MECHANISM</b>
      are taken, when available, and combined into a name of the form</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>UID=&lt;username&gt;[[,CN=&lt;realm&gt;],CN=&lt;mechanism&gt;],CN=auth</b></dt>
  <dd>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </dd>
</dl>
</div>
This name is then compared against the <b>match</b> POSIX (''extended'') regular
  expression, and if the match is successful, the name is replaced with the
  <b>replace</b> string. If there are wildcard strings in the <b>match</b>
  regular expression that are enclosed in parenthesis, e.g.
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>UID=([^,]*),CN=.*</b></dt>
  <dd>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </dd>
</dl>
</div>
then the portion of the name that matched the wildcard will be stored in the
  numbered placeholder variable $1. If there are other wildcard strings in
  parenthesis, the matching strings will be in $2, $3, etc. up to $9. The
  placeholders can then be used in the <b>replace</b> string, e.g.
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>UID=$1,OU=Accounts,DC=example,DC=com</b></dt>
  <dd>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </dd>
</dl>
</div>
The replaced name can be either a DN, i.e. a string prefixed by &quot;dn:&quot;,
  or an LDAP URI. If the latter, the server will use the URI to search its own
  database(s) and, if the search returns exactly one entry, the name is replaced
  by the DN of that entry. The LDAP URI must have no hostport, attrs, or
  extensions components, but the filter is mandatory, e.g.
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>ldap:///OU=Accounts,DC=example,DC=com??one?(UID=$1)</b></dt>
  <dd>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </dd>
</dl>
</div>
The protocol portion of the URI must be strictly <b>ldap</b>. Note that this
  search is subject to access controls. Specifically, the authentication
  identity must have &quot;auth&quot; access in the subject.
<p class="Pp">Multiple <b>olcAuthzRegexp</b> values can be specified to allow
    for multiple matching and replacement patterns. The matching patterns are
    checked in the order they appear in the attribute, stopping at the first
    successful match.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>olcConcurrency: &lt;integer&gt;</b></dt>
  <dd>Specify a desired level of concurrency. Provided to the underlying thread
      system as a hint. The default is not to provide any hint. This setting is
      only meaningful on some platforms where there is not a one to one
      correspondence between user threads and kernel threads.</dd>
  <dt><b>olcConnMaxPending: &lt;integer&gt;</b></dt>
  <dd>Specify the maximum number of pending requests for an anonymous session.
      If requests are submitted faster than the server can process them, they
      will be queued up to this limit. If the limit is exceeded, the session is
      closed. The default is 100.</dd>
  <dt><b>olcConnMaxPendingAuth: &lt;integer&gt;</b></dt>
  <dd>Specify the maximum number of pending requests for an authenticated
      session. The default is 1000.</dd>
  <dt><b>olcDisallows: &lt;features&gt;</b></dt>
  <dd>Specify a set of features to disallow (default none). <b>bind_anon</b>
      disables acceptance of anonymous bind requests. Note that this setting
      does not prohibit anonymous directory access (See &quot;require
      authc&quot;). <b>bind_simple</b> disables simple (bind) authentication.
      <b>tls_2_anon</b> disables forcing session to anonymous status (see also
      <b>tls_authc</b>) upon StartTLS operation receipt. <b>tls_authc</b>
      disallows the StartTLS operation if authenticated (see also
      <b>tls_2_anon</b>).</dd>
  <dt><b>olcExtraAttrs: &lt;attr&gt;</b></dt>
  <dd>Lists what attributes need to be added to search requests. Local storage
      backends return the entire entry to the frontend. The frontend takes care
      of only returning the requested attributes that are allowed by ACLs.
      However, features like access checking and so may need specific attributes
      that are not automatically returned by remote storage backends, like proxy
      backends and so on. <b>&lt;attr&gt;</b> is an attribute that is needed for
      internal purposes and thus always needs to be collected, even when not
      explicitly requested by clients. This attribute is multi-valued.</dd>
  <dt><b>olcGentleHUP: { TRUE | FALSE }</b></dt>
  <dd>A SIGHUP signal will only cause a 'gentle' shutdown-attempt: <b>Slapd</b>
      will stop listening for new connections, but will not close the
      connections to the current clients. Future write operations return
      unwilling-to-perform, though. Slapd terminates when all clients have
      closed their connections (if they ever do), or - as before - if it
      receives a SIGTERM signal. This can be useful if you wish to terminate the
      server and start a new <b>slapd</b> server <b>with another database,</b>
      without disrupting the currently active clients. The default is FALSE. You
      may wish to use <b>olcIdleTimeout</b> along with this option.</dd>
  <dt><b>olcIdleTimeout: &lt;integer&gt;</b></dt>
  <dd>Specify the number of seconds to wait before forcibly closing an idle
      client connection. A setting of 0 disables this feature. The default is 0.
      You may also want to set the <b>olcWriteTimeout</b> option.</dd>
  <dt><b>olcIndexIntLen: &lt;integer&gt;</b></dt>
  <dd>Specify the key length for ordered integer indices. The most significant
      bytes of the binary integer will be used for index keys. The default value
      is 4, which provides exact indexing for 31 bit values. A floating point
      representation is used to index too large values.</dd>
  <dt><b>olcIndexSubstrIfMaxlen: &lt;integer&gt;</b></dt>
  <dd>Specify the maximum length for subinitial and subfinal indices. Only this
      many characters of an attribute value will be processed by the indexing
      functions; any excess characters are ignored. The default is 4.</dd>
  <dt><b>olcIndexSubstrIfMinlen: &lt;integer&gt;</b></dt>
  <dd>Specify the minimum length for subinitial and subfinal indices. An
      attribute value must have at least this many characters in order to be
      processed by the indexing functions. The default is 2.</dd>
  <dt><b>olcIndexSubstrAnyLen: &lt;integer&gt;</b></dt>
  <dd>Specify the length used for subany indices. An attribute value must have
      at least this many characters in order to be processed. Attribute values
      longer than this length will be processed in segments of this length. The
      default is 4. The subany index will also be used in subinitial and
      subfinal index lookups when the filter string is longer than the
      <i>olcIndexSubstrIfMaxlen</i> value.</dd>
  <dt><b>olcIndexSubstrAnyStep: &lt;integer&gt;</b></dt>
  <dd>Specify the steps used in subany index lookups. This value sets the offset
      for the segments of a filter string that are processed for a subany index
      lookup. The default is 2. For example, with the default values, a search
      using this filter &quot;cn=*abcdefgh*&quot; would generate index lookups
      for &quot;abcd&quot;, &quot;cdef&quot;, and &quot;efgh&quot;.
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Note: Indexing support depends on the particular backend in use.
    Also, changing these settings will generally require deleting any indices
    that depend on these parameters and recreating them with
    <b>slapindex</b>(8).</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>olcListenerThreads: &lt;integer&gt;</b></dt>
  <dd>Specify the number of threads to use for the connection manager. The
      default is 1 and this is typically adequate for up to 16 CPU cores. The
      value should be set to a power of 2.</dd>
  <dt><b>olcLocalSSF: &lt;SSF&gt;</b></dt>
  <dd>Specifies the Security Strength Factor (SSF) to be given local LDAP
      sessions, such as those to the ldapi:// listener. For a description of SSF
      values, see <b>olcSaslSecProps</b>'s <b>minssf</b> option description. The
      default is 71.</dd>
  <dt><b>olcLogFile: &lt;filename&gt;</b></dt>
  <dd>Specify a file for recording debug log messages. By default these messages
      only go to stderr and are not recorded anywhere else. Specifying a logfile
      copies messages to both stderr and the logfile.</dd>
  <dt><b>olcLogLevel: &lt;integer&gt; [...]</b></dt>
  <dd>Specify the level at which debugging statements and operation statistics
      should be syslogged (currently logged to the <b>syslogd</b>(8) LOG_LOCAL4
      facility). They must be considered subsystems rather than increasingly
      verbose log levels. Some messages with higher priority are logged
      regardless of the configured loglevel as soon as any logging is
      configured. Log levels are additive, and available levels are:</dd>

  <dt><b>olcDefaultSearchBase: &lt;dn&gt;</b></dt>
  <dd>Specify a default search base to use when client submits a non-base search
      request with an empty base DN. Base scoped search requests with an empty
      base DN are not affected. This setting is only allowed in the frontend
      entry.</dd>
  <dt><b>olcPasswordHash: &lt;hash&gt; [&lt;hash&gt;...]</b></dt>
  <dd>This option configures one or more hashes to be used in generation of user
      passwords stored in the userPassword attribute during processing of LDAP
      Password Modify Extended Operations (RFC 3062). The &lt;hash&gt; must be
      one of <b>{SSHA}</b>, <b>{SHA}</b>, <b>{SMD5}</b>, <b>{MD5}</b>,
      <b>{CRYPT}</b>, and <b>{CLEARTEXT}</b>. The default is <b>{SSHA}</b>.
    <p class="Pp"><b>{SHA}</b> and <b>{SSHA}</b> use the SHA-1 algorithm (FIPS
        160-1), the latter with a seed.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><b>{MD5}</b> and <b>{SMD5}</b> use the MD5 algorithm (RFC

    <p class="Pp"><b>{CRYPT}</b> uses the <b>crypt</b>(3).</p>
    <p class="Pp"><b>{CLEARTEXT}</b> indicates that the new password should be

    <p class="Pp">Note that this option does not alter the normal user
        applications handling of userPassword during LDAP Add, Modify, or other
        LDAP operations. This setting is only allowed in the frontend entry.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>olcReadOnly: TRUE | FALSE</b></dt>
  <dd>This option puts the database into &quot;read-only&quot; mode. Any
      attempts to modify the database will return an &quot;unwilling to

      the server, since further writes to the config database will be
    rejected.</dd>
  <dt><b>olcRequires: &lt;conditions&gt;</b></dt>
  <dd>Specify a set of conditions to require (default none). The directive may
      be specified globally and/or per-database; databases inherit global
      conditions, so per-database specifications are additive. <b>bind</b>
      requires bind operation prior to directory operations. <b>LDAPv3</b>
      requires session to be using LDAP version 3. <b>authc</b> requires
      authentication prior to directory operations. <b>SASL</b> requires SASL
      authentication prior to directory operations. <b>strong</b> requires
      strong authentication prior to directory operations. The strong keyword
      allows protected &quot;simple&quot; authentication as well as SASL
      authentication. <b>none</b> may be used to require no conditions (useful
      to clear out globally set conditions within a particular database); it
      must occur first in the list of conditions.</dd>
  <dt><b>olcRestrict: &lt;oplist&gt;</b></dt>
  <dd>Specify a list of operations that are restricted. Restrictions on a
      specific database override any frontend setting. Operations can be any of
      <b>add</b>, <b>bind</b>, <b>compare</b>, <b>delete</b>,
      <b>extended[=&lt;OID&gt;]</b>, <b>modify</b>, <b>rename</b>,
      <b>search</b>, or the special pseudo-operations <b>read</b> and
      <b>write</b>, which respectively summarize read and write operations. The
      use of <i>restrict write</i> is equivalent to <i>olcReadOnly: TRUE</i>
      (see above). The <b>extended</b> keyword allows to indicate the OID of the
      specific operation to be restricted.</dd>
  <dt><b>olcSchemaDN: &lt;dn&gt;</b></dt>
  <dd>Specify the distinguished name for the subschema subentry that controls
      the entries on this server. The default is &quot;cn=Subschema&quot;.</dd>
  <dt><b>olcSecurity: &lt;factors&gt;</b></dt>
  <dd>Specify a set of security strength factors (separated by white space) to
      require (see <b>olcSaslSecprops</b>'s <b>minssf</b> option for a
      description of security strength factors). The directive may be specified
      globally and/or per-database. <b>ssf=&lt;n&gt;</b> specifies the overall
      security strength factor. <b>transport=&lt;n&gt;</b> specifies the
      transport security strength factor. <b>tls=&lt;n&gt;</b> specifies the TLS
      security strength factor. <b>sasl=&lt;n&gt;</b> specifies the SASL
      security strength factor. <b>update_ssf=&lt;n&gt;</b> specifies the
      overall security strength factor to require for directory updates.
      <b>update_transport=&lt;n&gt;</b> specifies the transport security
      strength factor to require for directory updates.
      <b>update_tls=&lt;n&gt;</b> specifies the TLS security strength factor to
      require for directory updates. <b>update_sasl=&lt;n&gt;</b> specifies the
      SASL security strength factor to require for directory updates.
      <b>simple_bind=&lt;n&gt;</b> specifies the security strength factor
      required for <i>simple</i> username/password authentication. Note that the
      <b>transport</b> factor is measure of security provided by the underlying
      transport, e.g. ldapi:// (and eventually IPSEC). It is not normally

DN type <b>self</b> is the default and means the bound user, while <b>this</b>
  means the base DN of the operation. The term <b>anonymous</b> matches all
  unauthenticated clients. The term <b>users</b> matches all authenticated
  clients; otherwise an <b>exact</b> dn pattern is assumed unless otherwise
  specified by qualifying the (optional) key string <b>dn</b> with <b>exact</b>
  or <b>base</b> (which are synonyms), to require an exact match; with
  <b>onelevel</b>, to require exactly one level of depth match; with
  <b>subtree</b>, to allow any level of depth match, including the exact match;
  with <b>children</b>, to allow any level of depth match, not including the
  exact match; <b>regex</b> explicitly requires the (default) match based on
  POSIX (''extended'') regular expression pattern. Finally, <b>anonymous</b>
  matches unbound operations; the <b>pattern</b> field is ignored. The same
  behavior is obtained by using the <b>anonymous</b> form of the
  <b>&lt;selector&gt;</b> clause. The term <b>group</b>, with the optional
  objectClass <b>oc</b> and attributeType <b>at</b> fields, followed by
  <b>pattern</b>, sets the limits for any DN listed in the values of the
  <b>at</b> attribute (default <b>member</b>) of the <b>oc</b> group objectClass
  (default <b>groupOfNames</b>) whose DN exactly matches <b>pattern</b>.
<p class="Pp">The currently supported limits are <b>size</b> and
  <b>time</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The syntax for time limits is
    <b>time[.{soft|hard}]=&lt;integer&gt;</b>, where <i>integer</i> is the
    number of seconds slapd will spend answering a search request. If no time
    limit is explicitly requested by the client, the <b>soft</b> limit is used;
    if the requested time limit exceeds the <b>hard</b> limit, the value of the
    limit is used instead. If the <b>hard</b> limit is set to the keyword
    <i>soft</i>, the soft limit is used in either case; if it is set to the
    keyword <i>unlimited</i>, no hard limit is enforced. Explicit requests for
    time limits smaller or equal to the <b>hard</b> limit are honored. If no
    limit specifier is set, the value is assigned to the <b>soft</b> limit, and
    the <b>hard</b> limit is set to <i>soft</i>, to preserve the original
    behavior.</p>
<p class="Pp">The syntax for size limits is
    <b>size[.{soft|hard|unchecked}]=&lt;integer&gt;</b>, where <i>integer</i> is
    the maximum number of entries slapd will return answering a search request.
    If no size limit is explicitly requested by the client, the <b>soft</b>
    limit is used; if the requested size limit exceeds the <b>hard</b> limit,
    the value of the limit is used instead. If the <b>hard</b> limit is set to
    the keyword <i>soft</i>, the soft limit is used in either case; if it is set
    to the keyword <i>unlimited</i>, no hard limit is enforced. Explicit
    requests for size limits smaller or equal to the <b>hard</b> limit are
    honored. The <b>unchecked</b> specifier sets a limit on the number of
    candidates a search request is allowed to examine. The rationale behind it
    is that searches for non-properly indexed attributes may result in large
    sets of candidates, which must be examined by <b>slapd</b>(8) to determine
    whether they match the search filter or not. The <b>unchecked</b> limit
    provides a means to drop such operations before they are even started. If
    the selected candidates exceed the <b>unchecked</b> limit, the search will
    abort with <i>Unwilling to perform</i>. If it is set to the keyword
    <i>unlimited</i>, no limit is applied (the default). If it is set to
    <i>disable</i>, the search is not even performed; this can be used to
    disallow searches for a specific set of users. If no limit specifier is set,
    the value is assigned to the <b>soft</b> limit, and the <b>hard</b> limit is
    set to <i>soft</i>, to preserve the original behavior.</p>
<p class="Pp">In case of no match, the global limits are used. The default
    values are the same as for <b>olcSizeLimit</b> and <b>olcTimeLimit</b>; no
    limit is set on <b>unchecked</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <b>pagedResults</b> control is requested, the <b>hard</b> size
    limit is used by default, because the request of a specific page size is
    considered an explicit request for a limitation on the number of entries to
    be returned. However, the size limit applies to the total count of entries
    returned within the search, and not to a single page. Additional size limits
    may be enforced; the syntax is
    <b>size.pr={&lt;integer&gt;|noEstimate|unlimited}</b>, where <i>integer</i>
    is the max page size if no explicit limit is set; the keyword
    <i>noEstimate</i> inhibits the server from returning an estimate of the
    total number of entries that might be returned (note: the current
    implementation does not return any estimate). The keyword <i>unlimited</i>
    indicates that no limit is applied to the pagedResults control page size.
    The syntax <b>size.prtotal={&lt;integer&gt;|unlimited|disabled}</b> allows
    to set a limit on the total number of entries that a pagedResults control
    allows to return. By default it is set to the <b>hard</b> limit. When set,
    <i>integer</i> is the max number of entries that the whole search with
    pagedResults control can return. Use <i>unlimited</i> to allow unlimited
    number of entries to be returned, e.g. to allow the use of the pagedResults
    control as a means to circumvent size limitations on regular searches; the
    keyword <i>disabled</i> disables the control, i.e. no paged results can be
    returned. Note that the total number of entries returned when the
    pagedResults control is requested cannot exceed the <b>hard</b> size limit
    of regular searches unless extended by the <b>prtotal</b> switch.</p>

  <dt><b>olcMaxDerefDepth: &lt;depth&gt;</b></dt>
  <dd>Specifies the maximum number of aliases to dereference when trying to
      resolve an entry, used to avoid infinite alias loops. The default is
    15.</dd>
  <dt><b>olcMirrorMode: TRUE | FALSE</b></dt>
  <dd>This option puts a replica database into &quot;mirror&quot; mode. Update
      operations will be accepted from any user, not just the updatedn. The
      database must already be configured as syncrepl consumer before this
      keyword may be set. This mode also requires a <b>olcServerID</b> (see
      above) to be configured. By default, this setting is FALSE.</dd>
  <dt><b>olcPlugin: &lt;plugin_type&gt; &lt;lib_path&gt; &lt;init_function&gt;
    [&lt;arguments&gt;]</b></dt>
  <dd>Configure a SLAPI plugin. See the <b>slapd.plugin</b>(5) manpage for more
      details.</dd>
  <dt><b>olcRootDN: &lt;dn&gt;</b></dt>
  <dd>Specify the distinguished name that is not subject to access control or
      administrative limit restrictions for operations on this database. This DN
      may or may not be associated with an entry. An empty root DN (the default)
      specifies no root access is to be granted. It is recommended that the
      rootdn only be specified when needed (such as when initially populating a
      database). If the rootdn is within a namingContext (suffix) of the
      database, a simple bind password may also be provided using the
      <b>olcRootPW</b> directive. Note that the rootdn is always needed when
      using syncrepl. The <b>olcRootDN</b> of the <b>cn=config</b> database
      defaults to <b>cn=config</b> itself.</dd>
  <dt><b>olcRootPW: &lt;password&gt;</b></dt>
  <dd>Specify a password (or hash of the password) for the rootdn. The password
      can only be set if the rootdn is within the namingContext (suffix) of the
      database. This option accepts all RFC 2307 userPassword formats known to
      the server (see <b>olcPasswordHash</b> description) as well as cleartext.
      <b>slappasswd</b>(8) may be used to generate a hash of a password.
      Cleartext and <b>{CRYPT}</b> passwords are not recommended. If empty (the
      default), authentication of the root DN is by other means (e.g. SASL). Use
      of SASL is encouraged.</dd>
  <dt><b>olcSubordinate: [TRUE | FALSE | advertise]</b></dt>
  <dd>Specify that the current backend database is a subordinate of another
      backend database. A subordinate database may have only one suffix. This
      option may be used to glue multiple databases into a single namingContext.
      If the suffix of the current database is within the namingContext of a
      superior database, searches against the superior database will be
      propagated to the subordinate as well. All of the databases associated
      with a single namingContext should have identical rootdns. Behavior of
      other LDAP operations is unaffected by this setting. In particular, it is
      not possible to use moddn to move an entry from one subordinate to another
      subordinate within the namingContext.
    <p class="Pp">If the optional <b>advertise</b> flag is supplied, the naming
        context of this database is advertised in the root DSE. The default is
        to hide this database context, so that only the superior context is
        visible.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If the slap tools <b>slapcat</b>(8), <b>slapadd</b>(8), or
        <b>slapindex</b>(8) are used on the superior database, any glued
        subordinates that support these tools are opened as well.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Databases that are glued together should usually be configured
        with the same indices (assuming they support indexing), even for
        attributes that only exist in some of these databases. In general, all
        of the glued databases should be configured as similarly as possible,
        since the intent is to provide the appearance of a single directory.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that the subordinate functionality is implemented
        internally by the <i>glue</i> overlay and as such its behavior will
        interact with other overlays in use. By default, the glue overlay is
        automatically configured as the last overlay on the superior database.
        Its position on the database can be explicitly configured by setting an
        <b>overlay glue</b> directive at the desired position. This explicit
        configuration is necessary e.g. when using the <i>syncprov</i> overlay,
        which needs to follow <i>glue</i> in order to work over all of the glued
        databases. E.g.</p>

<div class="Bd-indent">Specify the current database as a replica which is kept

  as a replication consumer site running a <b>syncrepl</b> replication engine.
  The replica content is kept synchronized to the master content using the LDAP
  Content Synchronization protocol. Refer to the &quot;OpenLDAP Administrator's
  Guide&quot; for detailed information on setting up a replicated <b>slapd</b>
  directory service using the <b>syncrepl</b> replication engine.
<p class="Pp"><b>rid</b> identifies the current <b>syncrepl</b> directive within
    the replication consumer site. It is a non-negative integer having no more
    than three decimal digits.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>provider</b> specifies the replication provider site containing
    the master content as an LDAP URI. If &lt;port&gt; is not given, the
    standard LDAP port number (389 or 636) is used.</p>
<p class="Pp">The content of the <b>syncrepl</b> replica is defined using a
    search specification as its result set. The consumer <b>slapd</b> will send
    search requests to the provider <b>slapd</b> according to the search
    specification. The search specification includes <b>searchbase, scope,
    filter, attrs, attrsonly, sizelimit,</b> and <b>timelimit</b> parameters as
    in the normal search specification. The <b>exattrs</b> option may also be
    used to specify attributes that should be omitted from incoming entries. The
    <b>scope</b> defaults to <b>sub</b>, the <b>filter</b> defaults to
    <b>(objectclass=*)</b>, and there is no default <b>searchbase</b>. The
    <b>attrs</b> list defaults to <b>&quot;*,+&quot;</b> to return all user and
    operational attributes, and <b>attrsonly</b> and <b>exattrs</b> are unset by
    default. The <b>sizelimit</b> and <b>timelimit</b> only accept
    &quot;unlimited&quot; and positive integers, and both default to
    &quot;unlimited&quot;. Note, however, that any provider-side limits for the
    replication identity will be enforced by the provider regardless of the
    limits requested by the LDAP Content Synchronization operation, much like
    for any other search operation.</p>
<p class="Pp">The LDAP Content Synchronization protocol has two operation types.
    In the <b>refreshOnly</b> operation, the next synchronization search
    operation is periodically rescheduled at an interval time (specified by
    <b>interval</b> parameter; 1 day by default) after each synchronization
    operation finishes. In the <b>refreshAndPersist</b> operation, a
    synchronization search remains persistent in the provider slapd. Further
    updates to the master replica will generate <b>searchResultEntry</b> to the
    consumer slapd as the search responses to the persistent synchronization
    search.</p>
<p class="Pp">If an error occurs during replication, the consumer will attempt
    to reconnect according to the <b>retry</b> parameter which is a list of the
    &lt;retry interval&gt; and &lt;# of retries&gt; pairs. For example,
    retry=&quot;60 10 300 3&quot; lets the consumer retry every 60 seconds for
    the first 10 times and then retry every 300 seconds for the next 3 times
    before stop retrying. The `+' in &lt;# of retries&gt; means indefinite
    number of retries until success.</p>
<p class="Pp">The schema checking can be enforced at the LDAP Sync consumer site
    by turning on the <b>schemachecking</b> parameter. The default is off.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>network-timeout</b> parameter sets how long the consumer
    will wait to establish a network connection to the provider. Once a
    connection is established, the <b>timeout</b> parameter determines how long
    the consumer will wait for the initial Bind request to complete. The
    defaults for these parameters come from <b>ldap.conf</b>(5).</p>
<p class="Pp">A <b>bindmethod</b> of <b>simple</b> requires the options
    <b>binddn</b> and <b>credentials</b> and should only be used when adequate
    security services (e.g. TLS or IPSEC) are in place. A <b>bindmethod</b> of
    <b>sasl</b> requires the option <b>saslmech.</b> Depending on the mechanism,
    an authentication identity and/or credentials can be specified using
    <b>authcid</b> and <b>credentials.</b> The <b>authzid</b> parameter may be
    used to specify an authorization identity. Specific security properties (as
    with the <b>sasl-secprops</b> keyword above) for a SASL bind can be set with
    the <b>secprops</b> option. A non default SASL realm can be set with the
    <b>realm</b> option. The provider, other than allow authentication of the
    syncrepl identity, should grant that identity appropriate access privileges
    to the data that is being replicated (<b>access</b> directive), and
    appropriate time and size limits (<b>limits</b> directive).</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>keepalive</b> parameter sets the values of <i>idle</i>,
    <i>probes</i>, and <i>interval</i> used to check whether a socket is alive;
    <i>idle</i> is the number of seconds a connection needs to remain idle
    before TCP starts sending keepalive probes; <i>probes</i> is the maximum
    number of keepalive probes TCP should send before dropping the connection;
    <i>interval</i> is interval in seconds between individual keepalive probes.
    Only some systems support the customization of these values; the
    <b>keepalive</b> parameter is ignored otherwise, and system-wide settings
    are used.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>starttls</b> parameter specifies use of the StartTLS
    extended operation to establish a TLS session before Binding to the
    provider. If the <b>critical</b> argument is supplied, the session will be
    aborted if the StartTLS request fails. Otherwise the syncrepl session
    continues without TLS. The tls_reqcert setting defaults to
    &quot;demand&quot; and the other TLS settings default to the same as the
    main slapd TLS settings.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>suffixmassage</b> parameter allows the consumer to pull
    entries from a remote directory whose DN suffix differs from the local
    directory. The portion of the remote entries' DNs that matches the
    <i>searchbase</i> will be replaced with the suffixmassage DN.</p>
<p class="Pp">Rather than replicating whole entries, the consumer can query logs
    of data modifications. This mode of operation is referred to as <i>delta</i>
    <i>syncrepl</i>. In addition to the above parameters, the <b>logbase</b> and
    <b>logfilter</b> parameters must be set appropriately for the log that will
    be used. The <b>syncdata</b> parameter must be set to either
    &quot;accesslog&quot; if the log conforms to the <b>slapo-accesslog</b>(5)
    log format, or &quot;changelog&quot; if the log conforms to the obsolete
    <i>changelog</i> format. If the <b>syncdata</b> parameter is omitted or set
    to &quot;default&quot; then the log parameters are ignored.</p>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>olcUpdateDN: &lt;dn&gt;</b></dt>
  <dd>This option is only applicable in a slave database. It specifies the DN
      permitted to update (subject to access controls) the replica. It is only
      needed in certain push-mode replication scenarios. Generally, this DN
      <i>should not</i> be the same as the <b>rootdn</b> used at the

<h1 class="Sh" id="OVERLAYS"><a class="permalink" href="#OVERLAYS">OVERLAYS</a></h1>
An overlay is a piece of code that intercepts database operations in order to
  extend or change them. Overlays are pushed onto a stack over the database, and
  so they will execute in the reverse of the order in which they were configured
  and the database itself will receive control last of all.
<p class="Pp">Overlays must be configured as child entries of a specific
    database. The entry's RDN must be of the form
    <b>olcOverlay={x}&lt;overlaytype&gt;</b> and the entry must have the
    olcOverlayConfig objectClass. Normally the config engine generates the
    &quot;{x}&quot; index in the RDN automatically, so it can be omitted when
    initially loading these entries.</p>
