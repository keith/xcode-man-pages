perldebug - Perl debugging
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
First of all, have you tried using the <b>-w</b> switch?
<p class="Pp">If you're new to the Perl debugger, you may prefer to read
    perldebtut, which is a tutorial introduction to the debugger.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="The_Perl_Debugger"><a class="permalink" href="#The_Perl_Debugger">The
  Perl Debugger</a></h1>
If you invoke Perl with the <b>-d</b> switch, your script runs under the Perl
  source debugger. This works like an interactive Perl environment, prompting
  for debugger commands that let you examine source code, set breakpoints, get
  stack backtraces, change the values of variables, etc. This is so convenient
  that you often fire up the debugger all by itself just to test out Perl
  constructs interactively to see what they do. For example:
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    $ perl -d -e 42
</pre>
<p class="Pp">In Perl, the debugger is not a separate program the way it usually
    is in the typical compiled environment. Instead, the <b>-d</b> flag tells
    the compiler to insert source information into the parse trees it's about to
    hand off to the interpreter. That means your code must first compile
    correctly for the debugger to work on it. Then when the interpreter starts
    up, it preloads a special Perl library file containing the debugger.</p>
<p class="Pp">The program will halt <i>right before</i> the first run-time
    executable statement (but see below regarding compile-time statements) and
    ask you to enter a debugger command. Contrary to popular expectations,
    whenever the debugger halts and shows you a line of code, it always displays
    the line it's <i>about</i> to execute, rather than the one it has just
    executed.</p>
<p class="Pp">Any command not recognized by the debugger is directly executed
    (<span class="Li">&quot;eval&quot;</span>'d) as Perl code in the current
    package. (The debugger uses the DB package for keeping its own state
    information.)</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that the said <span class="Li">&quot;eval&quot;</span> is
    bound by an implicit scope. As a result any newly introduced lexical
    variable or any modified capture buffer content is lost after the eval. The
    debugger is a nice environment to learn Perl, but if you interactively
    experiment using material which should be in the same scope, stuff it in one
    line.</p>
<p class="Pp">For any text entered at the debugger prompt, leading and trailing
    whitespace is first stripped before further processing. If a debugger
    command coincides with some function in your own program, merely precede the
    function with something that doesn't look like a debugger command, such as a
    leading <span class="Li">&quot;;&quot;</span> or perhaps a
    <span class="Li">&quot;+&quot;</span>, or by wrapping it with parentheses or
    braces.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Calling_the_Debugger"><a class="permalink" href="#Calling_the_Debugger">Calling
  the Debugger</a></h2>
There are several ways to call the debugger:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>perl -d program_name</dt>
  <dd>On the given program identified by
      <span class="Li">&quot;program_name&quot;</span>.</dd>
  <dt>perl -d -e 0</dt>
  <dd>Interactively supply an arbitrary
      <span class="Li">&quot;expression&quot;</span> using
      <span class="Li">&quot;-e&quot;</span>.</dd>
  <dt>perl -d:Ptkdb program_name</dt>
  <dd>Debug a given program via the
      <span class="Li">&quot;Devel::Ptkdb&quot;</span> GUI.</dd>
  <dt>perl -dt threaded_program_name</dt>
  <dd>Debug a given program using threads (experimental).</dd>
</dl>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Debugger_Commands"><a class="permalink" href="#Debugger_Commands">Debugger
  Commands</a></h2>
The interactive debugger understands the following commands:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>h</dt>
  <dd>Prints out a summary help message</dd>
  <dt>h [command]</dt>
  <dd>Prints out a help message for the given debugger command.</dd>
  <dt>h h</dt>
  <dd>The special argument of <span class="Li">&quot;h h&quot;</span> produces
      the entire help page, which is quite long.
    <p class="Pp">If the output of the <span class="Li">&quot;h h&quot;</span>
        command (or any command, for that matter) scrolls past your screen,
        precede the command with a leading pipe symbol so that it's run through
        your pager, as in</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    DB&gt; |h h
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">You may change the pager which is used via
        <span class="Li">&quot;o pager=...&quot;</span> command.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>p expr</dt>
  <dd>Same as <span class="Li">&quot;print {$DB::OUT} expr&quot;</span> in the
      current package. In particular, because this is just Perl's own
      <span class="Li">&quot;print&quot;</span> function, this means that nested
      data structures and objects are not dumped, unlike with the
      <span class="Li">&quot;x&quot;</span> command.
    <p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;DB::OUT&quot;</span> filehandle is
        opened to <i>/dev/tty</i>, regardless of where STDOUT may be redirected
        to.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>x [maxdepth] expr</dt>
  <dd>Evaluates its expression in list context and dumps out the result in a
      pretty-printed fashion. Nested data structures are printed out
      recursively, unlike the real <span class="Li">&quot;print&quot;</span>
      function in Perl. When dumping hashes, you'll probably prefer 'x \%h'
      rather than 'x <span class="Li">%h</span>'. See Dumpvalue if you'd like to
      do this yourself.
    <p class="Pp">The output format is governed by multiple options described
        under &quot;Configurable Options&quot;.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If the <span class="Li">&quot;maxdepth&quot;</span> is
        included, it must be a numeral <i>N</i>; the value is dumped only
        <i>N</i> levels deep, as if the
        <span class="Li">&quot;dumpDepth&quot;</span> option had been
        temporarily set to <i>N</i>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>V [pkg [vars]]</dt>
  <dd>Display all (or some) variables in package (defaulting to
      <span class="Li">&quot;main&quot;</span>) using a data pretty-printer
      (hashes show their keys and values so you see what's what, control
      characters are made printable, etc.). Make sure you don't put the type
      specifier (like <span class="Li">&quot;$&quot;</span>) there, just the
      symbol names, like this:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    V DB filename line
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Use <span class="Li">&quot;~pattern&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;!pattern&quot;</span> for positive and negative
        regexes.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This is similar to calling the
        <span class="Li">&quot;x&quot;</span> command on each applicable
      var.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>X [vars]</dt>
  <dd>Same as <span class="Li">&quot;V currentpackage [vars]&quot;</span>.</dd>
  <dt>y [level [vars]]</dt>
  <dd>Display all (or some) lexical variables (mnemonic:
      <span class="Li">&quot;mY&quot;</span> variables) in the current scope or
      <i>level</i> scopes higher. You can limit the variables that you see with
      <i>vars</i> which works exactly as it does for the
      <span class="Li">&quot;V&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;X&quot;</span> commands. Requires the
      <span class="Li">&quot;PadWalker&quot;</span> module version 0.08 or
      higher; will warn if this isn't installed. Output is pretty-printed in the
      same style as for <span class="Li">&quot;V&quot;</span> and the format is
      controlled by the same options.</dd>
  <dt>T</dt>
  <dd>Produce a stack backtrace. See below for details on its output.</dd>
  <dt>s [expr]</dt>
  <dd>Single step. Executes until the beginning of another statement, descending
      into subroutine calls. If an expression is supplied that includes function
      calls, it too will be single-stepped.</dd>
  <dt>n [expr]</dt>
  <dd>Next. Executes over subroutine calls, until the beginning of the next
      statement. If an expression is supplied that includes function calls,
      those functions will be executed with stops before each statement.</dd>
  <dt>r</dt>
  <dd>Continue until the return from the current subroutine. Dump the return
      value if the <span class="Li">&quot;PrintRet&quot;</span> option is set
      (default).</dd>
  <dt>&lt;CR&gt;</dt>
  <dd>Repeat last <span class="Li">&quot;n&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;s&quot;</span> command.</dd>
  <dt>c [line|sub]</dt>
  <dd>Continue, optionally inserting a one-time-only breakpoint at the specified
      line or subroutine.</dd>
  <dt>l</dt>
  <dd>List next window of lines.</dd>
  <dt>l min+incr</dt>
  <dd>List <span class="Li">&quot;incr+1&quot;</span> lines starting at
      <span class="Li">&quot;min&quot;</span>.</dd>
  <dt>l min-max</dt>
  <dd>List lines <span class="Li">&quot;min&quot;</span> through
      <span class="Li">&quot;max&quot;</span>. <span class="Li">&quot;l
      -&quot;</span> is synonymous to
    <span class="Li">&quot;-&quot;</span>.</dd>
  <dt>l line</dt>
  <dd>List a single line.</dd>
  <dt>l subname</dt>
  <dd>List first window of lines from subroutine. <i>subname</i> may be a
      variable that contains a code reference.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>-</dt>
  <dd>List previous window of lines.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>v [line]</dt>
  <dd>View a few lines of code around the current line.</dd>
  <dt>.</dt>
  <dd>Return the internal debugger pointer to the line last executed, and print
      out that line.</dd>
  <dt>f filename</dt>
  <dd>Switch to viewing a different file or
      <span class="Li">&quot;eval&quot;</span> statement. If <i>filename</i> is
      not a full pathname found in the values of <span class="Li">%INC</span>,
      it is considered a regex.
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;eval&quot;</span>ed strings (when
        accessible) are considered to be filenames: <span class="Li">&quot;f
        (eval 7)&quot;</span> and <span class="Li">&quot;f eval 7\b&quot;</span>
        access the body of the 7th <span class="Li">&quot;eval&quot;</span>ed
        string (in the order of execution). The bodies of the currently executed
        <span class="Li">&quot;eval&quot;</span> and of
        <span class="Li">&quot;eval&quot;</span>ed strings that define
        subroutines are saved and thus accessible.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>/pattern/</dt>
  <dd>Search forwards for pattern (a Perl regex); final / is optional. The
      search is case-insensitive by default.</dd>
  <dt>?pattern?</dt>
  <dd>Search backwards for pattern; final ? is optional. The search is
      case-insensitive by default.</dd>
  <dt>L [abw]</dt>
  <dd>List (default all) actions, breakpoints and watch expressions</dd>
  <dt>S [[!]regex]</dt>
  <dd>List subroutine names [not] matching the regex.</dd>
  <dt>t [n]</dt>
  <dd>Toggle trace mode (see also the
      <span class="Li">&quot;AutoTrace&quot;</span> option). Optional argument
      is the maximum number of levels to trace below the current one; anything
      deeper than that will be silent.</dd>
  <dt>t [n] expr</dt>
  <dd>Trace through execution of <span class="Li">&quot;expr&quot;</span>.
      Optional first argument is the maximum number of levels to trace below the
      current one; anything deeper than that will be silent. See &quot;Frame
      Listing Output Examples&quot; in perldebguts for examples.</dd>
  <dt>b</dt>
  <dd>Sets breakpoint on current line</dd>
  <dt>b [line] [condition]</dt>
  <dd>Set a breakpoint before the given line. If a condition is specified, it's
      evaluated each time the statement is reached: a breakpoint is taken only
      if the condition is true. Breakpoints may only be set on lines that begin
      an executable statement. Conditions don't use
      <span class="Li">&quot;if&quot;</span>:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    b 237 $x &gt; 30
    b 237 ++$count237 &lt; 11
    b 33 /pattern/i
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If the line number is <span class="Li">&quot;.&quot;</span>,
        sets a breakpoint on the current line:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    b . $n &gt; 100
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>b [file]:[line] [condition]</dt>
  <dd>Set a breakpoint before the given line in a (possibly different) file. If
      a condition is specified, it's evaluated each time the statement is
      reached: a breakpoint is taken only if the condition is true. Breakpoints
      may only be set on lines that begin an executable statement. Conditions
      don't use <span class="Li">&quot;if&quot;</span>:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    b lib/MyModule.pm:237 $x &gt; 30
    b /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/CGI.pm:100 ++$count100 &lt; 11
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>b subname [condition]</dt>
  <dd>Set a breakpoint before the first line of the named subroutine.
      <i>subname</i> may be a variable containing a code reference (in this case
      <i>condition</i> is not supported).</dd>
  <dt>b postpone subname [condition]</dt>
  <dd>Set a breakpoint at first line of subroutine after it is compiled.</dd>
  <dt>b load filename</dt>
  <dd>Set a breakpoint before the first executed line of the <i>filename</i>,
      which should be a full pathname found amongst the
      <span class="Li">%INC</span> values.</dd>
  <dt>b compile subname</dt>

  <dt>B *</dt>
  <dd>Delete all installed breakpoints.</dd>
  <dt>disable [file]:[line]</dt>
  <dd>Disable the breakpoint so it won't stop the execution of the program.
      Breakpoints are enabled by default and can be re-enabled using the
      <span class="Li">&quot;enable&quot;</span> command.</dd>
  <dt>disable [line]</dt>
  <dd>Disable the breakpoint so it won't stop the execution of the program.
      Breakpoints are enabled by default and can be re-enabled using the
      <span class="Li">&quot;enable&quot;</span> command.
    <p class="Pp">This is done for a breakpoint in the current file.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>enable [file]:[line]</dt>
  <dd>Enable the breakpoint so it will stop the execution of the program.</dd>
  <dt>enable [line]</dt>
  <dd>Enable the breakpoint so it will stop the execution of the program.
    <p class="Pp">This is done for a breakpoint in the current file.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>a [line] command</dt>
  <dd>Set an action to be done before the line is executed. If <i>line</i> is
      omitted, set an action on the line about to be executed. The sequence of
      steps taken by the debugger is
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
  1. check for a breakpoint at this line
  2. print the line if necessary (tracing)
  3. do any actions associated with that line
  4. prompt user if at a breakpoint or in single-step
  5. evaluate line
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">For example, this will print out <span class="Li">$foo</span>
        every time line 53 is passed:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    a 53 print &quot;DB FOUND $foo\n&quot;
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>A line</dt>
  <dd>Delete an action from the specified line.</dd>
  <dt>A *</dt>
  <dd>Delete all installed actions.</dd>
  <dt>w expr</dt>
  <dd>Add a global watch-expression. Whenever a watched global changes the
      debugger will stop and display the old and new values.</dd>
  <dt>W expr</dt>
  <dd>Delete watch-expression</dd>
  <dt>W *</dt>
  <dd>Delete all watch-expressions.</dd>
  <dt>o</dt>
  <dd>Display all options.</dd>
  <dt>o booloption ...</dt>
  <dd>Set each listed Boolean option to the value
    <span class="Li">1</span>.</dd>
  <dt>o anyoption? ...</dt>
  <dd>Print out the value of one or more options.</dd>
  <dt>o option=value ...</dt>
  <dd>Set the value of one or more options. If the value has internal
      whitespace, it should be quoted. For example, you could set
      <span class="Li">&quot;o</span> <span class="Li">pager=&quot;less
      -MQeicsNfr&quot;&quot;</span> to call <b>less</b> with those specific
      options. You may use either single or double quotes, but if you do, you
      must escape any embedded instances of same sort of quote you began with,
      as well as any escaping any escapes that immediately precede that quote
      but which are not meant to escape the quote itself. In other words, you
      follow single-quoting rules irrespective of the quote; eg:
      <span class="Li">&quot;o option='this isn\'t bad'&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;o option=&quot;She said, \&quot;Isn't</span>
      <span class="Li">it?\&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>.
    <p class="Pp">For historical reasons, the
        <span class="Li">&quot;=value&quot;</span> is optional, but defaults to
        1 only where it is safe to do so--that is, mostly for Boolean options.
        It is always better to assign a specific value using
        <span class="Li">&quot;=&quot;</span>. The
        <span class="Li">&quot;option&quot;</span> can be abbreviated, but for
        clarity probably should not be. Several options can be set together. See
        &quot;Configurable Options&quot; for a list of these.</p>

  Options</a></h2>
The debugger has numerous options settable using the
  <span class="Li">&quot;o&quot;</span> command, either interactively or from
  the environment or an rc file. (./.perldb or ~/.perldb under Unix.)
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>&quot;recallCommand&quot;, &quot;ShellBang&quot;</dt>
  <dd>The characters used to recall a command or spawn a shell. By default, both
      are set to <span class="Li">&quot;!&quot;</span>, which is
    unfortunate.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;pager&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Program to use for output of pager-piped commands (those beginning with a
      <span class="Li">&quot;|&quot;</span> character.) By default,
      <span class="Li">$ENV{PAGER}</span> will be used. Because the debugger
      uses your current terminal characteristics for bold and underlining, if
      the chosen pager does not pass escape sequences through unchanged, the
      output of some debugger commands will not be readable when sent through
      the pager.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;tkRunning&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Run Tk while prompting (with ReadLine).</dd>
  <dt>&quot;signalLevel&quot;, &quot;warnLevel&quot;, &quot;dieLevel&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Level of verbosity. By default, the debugger leaves your exceptions and
      warnings alone, because altering them can break correctly running
      programs. It will attempt to print a message when uncaught INT, BUS, or
      SEGV signals arrive. (But see the mention of signals in &quot;BUGS&quot;
      below.)
    <p class="Pp">To disable this default safe mode, set these values to
        something higher than 0. At a level of 1, you get backtraces upon
        receiving any kind of warning (this is often annoying) or exception
        (this is often valuable). Unfortunately, the debugger cannot discern
        fatal exceptions from non-fatal ones. If
        <span class="Li">&quot;dieLevel&quot;</span> is even 1, then your
        non-fatal exceptions are also traced and unceremoniously altered if they
        came from <span class="Li">&quot;eval'ed&quot;</span> strings or from
        any kind of <span class="Li">&quot;eval&quot;</span> within modules
        you're attempting to load. If
        <span class="Li">&quot;dieLevel&quot;</span> is 2, the debugger doesn't
        care where they came from: It usurps your exception handler and prints
        out a trace, then modifies all exceptions with its own embellishments.
        This may perhaps be useful for some tracing purposes, but tends to
        hopelessly destroy any program that takes its exception handling
        seriously.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>&quot;AutoTrace&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Trace mode (similar to <span class="Li">&quot;t&quot;</span> command, but
      can be put into <span class="Li">&quot;PERLDB_OPTS&quot;</span>).</dd>
  <dt>&quot;LineInfo&quot;</dt>
  <dd>File or pipe to print line number info to. If it is a pipe (say,
      <span class="Li">&quot;|visual_perl_db&quot;</span>), then a short message
      is used. This is the mechanism used to interact with a slave editor or
      visual debugger, such as the special
      <span class="Li">&quot;vi&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;emacs&quot;</span> hooks, or the
      <span class="Li">&quot;ddd&quot;</span> graphical debugger.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;inhibit_exit&quot;</dt>
  <dd>If 0, allows <i>stepping off</i> the end of the script.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;PrintRet&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Print return value after <span class="Li">&quot;r&quot;</span> command if
      set (default).</dd>
  <dt>&quot;ornaments&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Affects screen appearance of the command line (see Term::ReadLine). There
      is currently no way to disable these, which can render some output
      illegible on some displays, or with some pagers. This is considered a
    bug.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;frame&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Affects the printing of messages upon entry and exit from subroutines. If
      <span class="Li">&quot;frame &amp; 2&quot;</span> is false, messages are
      printed on entry only. (Printing on exit might be useful if interspersed
      with other messages.)
    <p class="Pp">If <span class="Li">&quot;frame &amp; 4&quot;</span>,
        arguments to functions are printed, plus context and caller info. If
        <span class="Li">&quot;frame &amp; 8&quot;</span>, overloaded
        <span class="Li">&quot;stringify&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;tie&quot;</span>d
        <span class="Li">&quot;FETCH&quot;</span> is enabled on the printed
        arguments. If <span class="Li">&quot;frame</span> <span class="Li">&amp;
        16&quot;</span>, the return value from the subroutine is printed.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The length at which the argument list is truncated is governed
        by the next option:</p>

  <dt>&quot;maxTraceLen&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Length to truncate the argument list when the

  <dt>&quot;arrayDepth&quot;, &quot;hashDepth&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Print only first N elements ('' for all).</dd>
  <dt>&quot;dumpDepth&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Limit recursion depth to N levels when dumping structures. Negative values
      are interpreted as infinity. Default: infinity.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;compactDump&quot;, &quot;veryCompact&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Change the style of array and hash output. If
      <span class="Li">&quot;compactDump&quot;</span>, short array may be
      printed on one line.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;globPrint&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Whether to print contents of globs.</dd>

  <dd>Dump arrays holding debugged files.</dd>

  <dd>Dump contents of &quot;reused&quot; addresses.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;quote&quot;, &quot;HighBit&quot;, &quot;undefPrint&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Change the style of string dump. The default value for
      <span class="Li">&quot;quote&quot;</span> is
      <span class="Li">&quot;auto&quot;</span>; one can enable double-quotish or
      single-quotish format by setting it to
      <span class="Li">&quot;&quot;&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;'&quot;</span>, respectively. By default,
      characters with their high bit set are printed verbatim.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;UsageOnly&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Rudimentary per-package memory usage dump. Calculates total size of
      strings found in variables in the package. This does not include lexicals
      in a module's file scope, or lost in closures.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;HistFile&quot;</dt>
  <dd>The path of the file from which the history (assuming a usable
      Term::ReadLine backend) will be read on the debugger's startup, and to
      which it will be saved on shutdown (for persistence across sessions).
      Similar in concept to Bash's
      <span class="Li">&quot;.bash_history&quot;</span> file.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;HistSize&quot;</dt>
  <dd>The count of the saved lines in the history (assuming
      <span class="Li">&quot;HistFile&quot;</span> above).</dd>

<p class="Pp">After the rc file is read, the debugger reads the
    <span class="Li">$ENV{PERLDB_OPTS}</span> environment variable and parses
    this as the remainder of a &quot;O ...&quot; line as one might enter at the

      to a TTY specified in the <span class="Li">&quot;TTY&quot;</span> option
      at startup, or to a tty found at runtime using the
      <span class="Li">&quot;Term::Rendezvous&quot;</span> module of your

    <p class="Pp">This module should implement a method named

  Compile-Time Statements</a></h2>
If you have compile-time executable statements (such as code within BEGIN,
  UNITCHECK and CHECK blocks or <span class="Li">&quot;use&quot;</span>
  statements), these will <i>not</i> be stopped by debugger, although
  <span class="Li">&quot;require&quot;</span>s and INIT blocks will, and
  compile-time statements can be traced with the
  <span class="Li">&quot;AutoTrace&quot;</span> option set in
  <span class="Li">&quot;PERLDB_OPTS&quot;</span>). From your own Perl code,
  however, you can transfer control back to the debugger using the following
  statement, which is harmless if the debugger is not running:
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    $DB::single = 1;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If you set <span class="Li">$DB::single</span> to 2, it's
    equivalent to having just typed the <span class="Li">&quot;n&quot;</span>
    command, whereas a value of 1 means the
    <span class="Li">&quot;s&quot;</span> command. The
    <span class="Li">$DB::trace</span> variable should be set to 1 to simulate
    having typed the <span class="Li">&quot;t&quot;</span> command.</p>
<p class="Pp">Another way to debug compile-time code is to start the debugger,
    set a breakpoint on the <i>load</i> of some module:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    DB&lt;7&gt; b load f:/perllib/lib/Carp.pm

The debugger probably contains enough configuration hooks that you won't ever

  within the debugger using its <span class="Li">&quot;o&quot;</span> command,
  from the command line via the <span class="Li">&quot;PERLDB_OPTS&quot;</span>
  environment variable, and from customization files.
<p class="Pp">You can do some customization by setting up a <i>.perldb</i> file,
    which contains initialization code. For instance, you could make aliases
    like these (the last one is one people expect to be there):</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    $DB::alias{'len'}  = 's/^len(.*)/p length($1)/';
    $DB::alias{'stop'} = 's/^stop (at|in)/b/';
    $DB::alias{'ps'}   = 's/^ps\b/p scalar /';
    $DB::alias{'quit'} = 's/^quit(\s*)/exit/';
</pre>
<p class="Pp">You can change options from <i>.perldb</i> by using calls like
    this one;</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    parse_options(&quot;NonStop=1 LineInfo=db.out AutoTrace=1 frame=2&quot;);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The code is executed in the package
    <span class="Li">&quot;DB&quot;</span>. Note that <i>.perldb</i> is
    processed before processing <span class="Li">&quot;PERLDB_OPTS&quot;</span>.
    If <i>.perldb</i> defines the subroutine
    <span class="Li">&quot;afterinit&quot;</span>, that function is called after
    debugger initialization ends. <i>.perldb</i> may be contained in the current
    directory, or in the home directory. Because this file is sourced in by Perl
    and may contain arbitrary commands, for security reasons, it must be owned
    by the superuser or the current user, and writable by no one but its
  owner.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can mock TTY input to debugger by adding arbitrary commands to
    <span class="Li">@DB::typeahead</span>. For example, your <i>.perldb</i>
    file might contain:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    sub afterinit { push @DB::typeahead, &quot;b 4&quot;, &quot;b 6&quot;; }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Which would attempt to set breakpoints on lines 4 and 6
    immediately after debugger initialization. Note that
    <span class="Li">@DB::typeahead</span> is not a supported interface and is
    subject to change in future releases.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you want to modify the debugger, copy <i>perl5db.pl</i> from
    the Perl library to another name and hack it to your heart's content. You'll
    then want to set your <span class="Li">&quot;PERL5DB&quot;</span>
    environment variable to say something like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    BEGIN { require &quot;myperl5db.pl&quot; }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">As a last resort, you could also use
    <span class="Li">&quot;PERL5DB&quot;</span> to customize the debugger by
    directly setting internal variables or calling debugger functions.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that any variables and functions that are not documented in
    this document (or in perldebguts) are considered for internal use only, and
    as such are subject to change without notice.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Readline_Support_/_History_in_the_Debugger"><a class="permalink" href="#Readline_Support_/_History_in_the_Debugger">Readline
  Support / History in the Debugger</a></h2>
As shipped, the only command-line history supplied is a simplistic one that
  checks for leading exclamation points. However, if you install the
  Term::ReadKey and Term::ReadLine modules from CPAN (such as
  Term::ReadLine::Gnu, Term::ReadLine::Perl, ...) you will have full editing
  capabilities much like those GNU <i>readline</i>(3) provides. Look for these
  in the <i>modules/by-module/Term</i> directory on CPAN. These do not support
  normal <b>vi</b> command-line editing, however.
<p class="Pp">A rudimentary command-line completion is also available, including
    lexical variables in the current scope if the
    <span class="Li">&quot;PadWalker&quot;</span> module is installed.</p>
<p class="Pp">Without Readline support you may see the symbols &quot;^[[A&quot;,
    &quot;^[[C&quot;, &quot;^[[B&quot;, &quot;^[[D&quot;&quot;, &quot;^H&quot;,
    ... when using the arrow keys and/or the backspace key.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Editor_Support_for_Debugging"><a class="permalink" href="#Editor_Support_for_Debugging">Editor
  Support for Debugging</a></h2>
If you have the FSF's version of <b>emacs</b> installed on your system, it can
  interact with the Perl debugger to provide an integrated software development
  environment reminiscent of its interactions with C debuggers.
<p class="Pp">Recent versions of Emacs come with a start file for making
    <b>emacs</b> act like a syntax-directed editor that understands (some of)
    Perl's syntax. See perlfaq3.</p>
<p class="Pp">A similar setup by Tom Christiansen for interacting with any
    vendor-shipped <b>vi</b> and the X11 window system is also available. This
    works similarly to the integrated multiwindow support that <b>emacs</b>
    provides, where the debugger drives the editor. At the time of this writing,
    however, that tool's eventual location in the Perl distribution was
    uncertain.</p>
<p class="Pp">Users of <b>vi</b> should also look into <b>vim</b> and
    <b>gvim</b>, the mousey and windy version, for coloring of Perl
  keywords.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that only perl can truly parse Perl, so all such CASE tools
    fall somewhat short of the mark, especially if you don't program your Perl
    as a C programmer might.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="The_Perl_Profiler"><a class="permalink" href="#The_Perl_Profiler">The
  Perl Profiler</a></h2>
If you wish to supply an alternative debugger for Perl to run, invoke your
  script with a colon and a package argument given to the <b>-d</b> flag. Perl's
  alternative debuggers include a Perl profiler, Devel::NYTProf, which is
  available separately as a CPAN distribution. To profile your Perl program in
  the file <i>mycode.pl</i>, just type:
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    $ perl -d:NYTProf mycode.pl
</pre>
<p class="Pp">When the script terminates the profiler will create a database of
    the profile information that you can turn into reports using the profiler's
    tools. See &lt;perlperf&gt; for details.</p>

<span class="Li">&quot;use re 'debug'&quot;</span> enables you to see the gory
  details of how the Perl regular expression engine works. In order to
  understand this typically voluminous output, one must not only have some idea
  about how regular expression matching works in general, but also know how
  Perl's regular expressions are internally compiled into an automaton. These
  matters are explored in some detail in &quot;Debugging Regular

Perl contains internal support for reporting its own memory usage, but this is a
  fairly advanced concept that requires some understanding of how memory
  allocation works. See &quot;Debugging Perl Memory Usage&quot; in perldebguts

You did try the <b>-w</b> switch, didn't you?
<p class="Pp">perldebtut, perldebguts, re, DB, Devel::NYTProf, Dumpvalue, and
    perlrun.</p>
<p class="Pp">When debugging a script that uses #! and is thus normally found in
    <span class="Li">$PATH</span>, the -S option causes perl to search
    <span class="Li">$PATH</span> for it, so you don't have to type the path or
    <span class="Li">&quot;which $scriptname&quot;</span>.</p>

You cannot get stack frame information or in any fashion debug functions that
  were not compiled by Perl, such as those from C or C++ extensions.
<p class="Pp">If you alter your <span class="Li">@_</span> arguments in a
    subroutine (such as with <span class="Li">&quot;shift&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;pop&quot;</span>), the stack backtrace will not show
    the original values.</p>
<p class="Pp">The debugger does not currently work in conjunction with the
    <b>-W</b> command-line switch, because it itself is not free of
  warnings.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you're in a slow syscall (like
    <span class="Li">&quot;wait&quot;</span>ing,
    <span class="Li">&quot;accept&quot;</span>ing, or
    <span class="Li">&quot;read&quot;</span>ing from your keyboard or a socket)
    and haven't set up your own <span class="Li">$SIG{INT}</span> handler, then
    you won't be able to CTRL-C your way back to the debugger, because the
    debugger's own <span class="Li">$SIG{INT}</span> handler doesn't understand
    that it needs to raise an exception to <i>longjmp</i>(3) out of slow
    syscalls.</p>
