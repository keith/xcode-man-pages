  <dt id="Overloading"><a class="permalink" href="#Overloading">Overloading
    implementation has changed</a></dt>
  <dd>Overloading meta information used to be implemented by a
      <span class="Li">&quot;Class::MOP::Method::Overload&quot;</span> class.
      This class has been removed, and overloading is now implemented by
      Class::MOP::Overload. Overloading is not really equivalent to a method, so
      the former implementation didn't work properly for various cases.
    <p class="Pp">All of the overloading-related methods for classes and roles
        have the same names, but those methods now return Class::MOP::Overload
        objects.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="Core"><a class="permalink" href="#Core">Core support for overloading
    in roles</a></dt>
  <dd>Roles which use overloading now pass that overloading onto other classes
      (and roles) which consume that role.
    <p class="Pp">This works much like MooseX::Role::WithOverloading, except
        that we properly detect overloading conflicts during role summation and
        when applying one role to another. MooseX::Role::WithOverloading did not
        do any conflict detection.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you want to write code that uses overloading and works with
        previous versions of Moose and this one, upgrade to
        MooseX::Role::WithOverloading version 0.15 or greater. That version will
        detect when Moose itself handles overloading and get out of the way.</p>

  <dd>This means that this will no longer die (and will also no longer try to

    <pre>  {
      package Foo;
      use Moose;
  }
  # ...
  use Foo;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If you're using the MOP, this behavior will occur when the
        <span class="Li">&quot;create&quot;</span> (or
        <span class="Li">&quot;create_anon_class&quot;</span>) method is used,
        but not when the <span class="Li">&quot;initialize&quot;</span> method
        is used.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="Moose"><a class="permalink" href="#Moose">Moose now uses
    Module::Runtime instead of Class::Load to load classes</a></dt>
  <dd>Class::Load has always had some weird issues with the ways that it tries
      to figure out if a class is loaded. For instance, extending an empty
      package was previously impossible, because Class::Load would think that
      the class failed to load, even though that is a perfectly valid thing to
      do. It was also difficult to deal with modules like IO::Handle, which
      partially populate several other packages when they are loaded (so calling
      <span class="Li">&quot;load_class&quot;</span> on
      <span class="Li">'IO::Handle'</span> followed by
      <span class="Li">'IO::File'</span> could end up with a broken
      <span class="Li">&quot;IO::File&quot;</span>, in some cases).
    <p class="Pp">Now, Moose uses the same mechanisms as perl itself to figure
        out if a class is loaded. A class is considered to be loaded if its
        entry in <span class="Li">%INC</span> is set. Perl sets the
        <span class="Li">%INC</span> entry for you automatically whenever a file
        is loaded via <span class="Li">&quot;use&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;require&quot;</span>. Also, as mentioned above,
        Moose also now sets the <span class="Li">%INC</span> entry for any
        classes defined with it, even if they aren't loaded from a separate
        file. This does however mean that if you are trying to use Moose with
        non-Moose classes defined in the same file, then you will need to set
        <span class="Li">%INC</span> manually now, where it may have worked in
        the past. For instance:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>  {
      package My::NonMoose;
      sub new { bless {}, shift }
      $INC{'My/NonMoose.pm'} = __FILE__;
      # alternatively:
      # use Module::Runtime 'module_notional_filename';
      # $INC{module_notional_filename(__PACKAGE__)} = __FILE__;
  }
  {
      package My::Moose;
      use Moose;
      extends 'My::NonMoose';
  }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If you don't do this, you will get an error message about not
        being able to locate <span class="Li">&quot;My::NonMoose&quot;</span> in
        <span class="Li">@INC</span>. We hope that this case will be fairly
        rare.</p>

    <pre>  enum('MyType' =&gt; qw(foo bar baz))
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This was confusing, however (since it was different from the

        difficult (since you can't tell just by looking whether
        <span class="Li">&quot;enum('Foo', 'Bar', 'Baz')&quot;</span> was
        intended to be a type named <span class="Li">&quot;Foo&quot;</span> with

        <span class="Li">&quot;Baz&quot;</span>, or if this was actually a
        mistake where someone got the syntax for an anonymous enum type wrong).

      exception objects, which provide very detailed information about the
      exceptions. These exception objects provide a string overload that matches
      the previous exception message, so in most cases you should not have to
      change your code.
    <p class="Pp">For learning about the usage of Moose exception objects, read
        Moose::Manual::Exceptions. Individual exceptions are documented in

      like <span class="Li">&quot; 1234 \n&quot;</span>. We believe that the
      type constraint should indicate &quot;this is a number&quot;, not
      &quot;this coerces to a number&quot;. Therefore, Num now only accepts
      integers, floating point numbers (both in decimal notation and exponential

      that must be satisfied in order for the child type to be satisfied, but in
      a union, validating as any parent type will validate against the entire
      union. This has been changed to find the nearest common ancestor for all

  <dd>Previously, a union type would report itself as being of a subtype of a
      type if <i>any</i> of its member types were subtypes of that type. This

  <dd>Previously, when a role was applied to a class, it would use the attribute
      metaclass defined in the class when copying over the attributes in the

      class would end up renaming all of the accessors generated by the role,
      some of which may be being called in the role, causing it to break. Roles
      now keep track of their own attribute metaclass to use by default when

  <dt id="Native"><a class="permalink" href="#Native">Native
    Delegations</a></dt>
  <dd>In previous versions of Moose, the Native delegations were created as
      closures. The generated code was often quite slow compared to doing the
      same thing by hand. For example, the Array's push delegation ended up
      doing something like this:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>  push @{ $self-&gt;$reader() }, @_;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If the attribute was created without a reader, the
        <span class="Li">$reader</span> sub reference followed a very slow code
        path. Even with a reader, this is still slower than it needs to be.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Native delegations are now generated as inline code, just like
        other accessors, so we can access the slot directly.</p>
    <p class="Pp">In addition, native traits now do proper constraint checking
        in all cases. In particular, constraint checking has been improved for
        array and hash references. Previously, only the <i>contained</i> type
        (the <span class="Li">&quot;Str&quot;</span> in
        <span class="Li">&quot;HashRef[Str]&quot;</span>) would be checked when
        a new value was added to the collection. However, if there was a
        constraint that applied to the whole value, this was never checked.</p>
    <p class="Pp">In addition, coercions are now called on the whole value.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The delegation methods now do more argument checking. All of
        the methods check that a valid number of arguments were passed to the
        method. In addition, the delegation methods check that the arguments are
        sane (array indexes, hash keys, numbers, etc.) when applicable. We have
        tried to emulate the behavior of Perl builtins as much as possible.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Finally, triggers are called whenever the value of the
        attribute is changed by a Native delegation.</p>
    <p class="Pp">These changes are only likely to break code in a few
      cases.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The inlining code may or may not preserve the original
        reference when changes are made. In some cases, methods which change the
        value may replace it entirely. This will break tied values.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you have a typed arrayref or hashref attribute where the
        type enforces a constraint on the whole collection, this constraint will
        now be checked. It's possible that code which previously ran without
        errors will now cause the constraint to fail. However, presumably this
        is a good thing ;)</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you are passing invalid arguments to a delegation which
        were previously being ignored, these calls will now fail.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If your code relied on the trigger only being called for a
        regular writer, that may cause problems.</p>
    <p class="Pp">As always, you are encouraged to test before deploying the
        latest version of Moose to production.</p>

  <dt id="Defaults"><a class="permalink" href="#Defaults">Defaults is and

  <dd>A few native traits (String, Counter, Bool) provide default values of

  <dd>Moose::Meta::Attribute now allows all options to be changed in an

      whitelisted using the
      <span class="Li">&quot;legal_options_for_inheritance&quot;</span> method.
      This method has been removed, and there is a new method,
      <span class="Li">&quot;illegal_options_for_inheritance&quot;</span>, which
      can now be used to prevent certain options from being changeable.
    <p class="Pp">In addition, we only throw an error if the illegal option is
        actually changed. If the superclass didn't specify this option at all
        when defining the attribute, the subclass version can still add it as an
        option.</p>

<p class="Pp">You could declare a name with subtype such as &quot;Foo!Bar&quot;.
    Moose would accept this allowed, but if you used it in a parameterized type
    such as &quot;ArrayRef[Foo!Bar]&quot; it wouldn't work. We now do some

<p class="Pp">Removing an attribute from a class now also removes delegation

<p class="Pp">Roles now add methods by calling

    <span class="Li">&quot;alias_method&quot;</span>. They make sure to always
    provide a method object, which will be cloned internally. This means that it
    is now possible to track the source of a method provided by a role, and even
    follow its history through intermediate roles. This means that methods added
    by a role now show up when looking at a class's method list/map.</p>
<p class="Pp">Parameter and Union args are now sorted, this makes Int|Str the
    same constraint as Str|Int. Also, incoming type constraint strings are
    normalized to remove all whitespace differences. This is mostly for
    internals and should not affect outside code.</p>
<p class="Pp">Moose::Exporter will no longer remove a subroutine that the
    exporting package re-exports. Moose re-exports the Carp::confess function,
    among others. The reasoning is that we cannot know whether you have also
    explicitly imported those functions for your own use, so we err on the safe
    side and always keep them.</p>
