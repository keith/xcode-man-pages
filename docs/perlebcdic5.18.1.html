An exploration of some of the issues facing Perl programmers on EBCDIC based
  computers. We do not cover localization, internationalization, or multi-byte
  character set issues other than some discussion of UTF-8 and UTF-EBCDIC.
<p class="Pp">Portions that are still incomplete are marked with XXX.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl used to work on EBCDIC machines, but there are now areas of
    the code where it doesn't. If you want to use Perl on an EBCDIC machine,

The American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII or US-ASCII) is a
  set of integers running from 0 to 127 (decimal) that imply character
  interpretation by the display and other systems of computers. The range 0..127
  can be covered by setting the bits in a 7-bit binary digit, hence the set is
  sometimes referred to as &quot;7-bit ASCII&quot;. ASCII was described by the
  American National Standards Institute document ANSI X3.4-1986. It was also
  described by ISO 646:1991 (with localization for currency symbols). The full
  ASCII set is given in the table below as the first 128 elements. Languages
  that can be written adequately with the characters in ASCII include English,
  Hawaiian, Indonesian, Swahili and some Native American languages.
<p class="Pp">There are many character sets that extend the range of integers
    from 0..2**7-1 up to 2**8-1, or 8 bit bytes (octets if you prefer). One
    common one is the ISO 8859-1 character set.</p>

The ISO 8859-$n are a collection of character code sets from the International
  Organization for Standardization (ISO), each of which adds characters to the
  ASCII set that are typically found in European languages, many of which are
  based on the Roman, or Latin, alphabet.

A particular 8-bit extension to ASCII that includes grave and acute accented
  Latin characters. Languages that can employ ISO 8859-1 include all the
  languages covered by ASCII as well as Afrikaans, Albanian, Basque, Catalan,
  Danish, Faroese, Finnish, Norwegian, Portuguese, Spanish, and Swedish. Dutch
  is covered albeit without the ij ligature. French is covered too but without
  the oe ligature. German can use ISO 8859-1 but must do so without German-style
  quotation marks. This set is based on Western European extensions to ASCII and
  is commonly encountered in world wide web work. In IBM character code set
  identification terminology ISO 8859-1 is also known as CCSID 819 (or sometimes
  0819 or even 00819).

The Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code refers to a large collection
  of single- and multi-byte coded character sets that are different from ASCII
  or ISO 8859-1 and are all slightly different from each other; they typically
  run on host computers. The EBCDIC encodings derive from 8-bit byte extensions
  of Hollerith punched card encodings. The layout on the cards was such that
  high bits were set for the upper and lower case alphabet characters [a-z] and
  [A-Z], but there were gaps within each Latin alphabet range.
<p class="Pp">Some IBM EBCDIC character sets may be known by character code set
    identification numbers (CCSID numbers) or code page numbers.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl can be compiled on platforms that run any of three commonly
    used EBCDIC character sets, listed below.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>The 13 variant characters</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Among IBM EBCDIC character code sets there are 13 characters that
    are often mapped to different integer values. Those characters are known as
    the 13 &quot;variant&quot; characters and are:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    \ [ ] { } ^ ~ ! # | $ @ `
</pre>
<p class="Pp">When Perl is compiled for a platform, it looks at some of these
    characters to guess which EBCDIC character set the platform uses, and adapts
    itself accordingly to that platform. If the platform uses a character set
    that is not one of the three Perl knows about, Perl will either fail to
    compile, or mistakenly and silently choose one of the three. They are:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>0037</b></dt>
  <dd>Character code set ID 0037 is a mapping of the ASCII plus Latin-1
      characters (i.e. ISO 8859-1) to an EBCDIC set. 0037 is used in North
      American English locales on the OS/400 operating system that runs on
      AS/400 computers. CCSID 0037 differs from ISO 8859-1 in 237 places, in
      other words they agree on only 19 code point values.</dd>
  <dt><b>1047</b></dt>
  <dd>Character code set ID 1047 is also a mapping of the ASCII plus Latin-1
      characters (i.e. ISO 8859-1) to an EBCDIC set. 1047 is used under Unix
      System Services for OS/390 or z/OS, and OpenEdition for VM/ESA. CCSID 1047
      differs from CCSID 0037 in eight places.</dd>

  code points versus EBCDIC code points</a></h2>
In Unicode terminology a <i>code point</i> is the number assigned to a
  character: for example, in EBCDIC the character &quot;A&quot; is usually
  assigned the number 193. In Unicode the character &quot;A&quot; is assigned
  the number 65. This causes a problem with the semantics of the pack/unpack
  &quot;U&quot;, which are supposed to pack Unicode code points to characters
  and back to numbers. The problem is: which code points to use for code points
  less than 256? (for 256 and over there's no problem: Unicode code points are
  used) In EBCDIC, for the low 256 the EBCDIC code points are used. This means
  that the equivalences
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    pack(&quot;U&quot;, ord($character)) eq $character
    unpack(&quot;U&quot;, $character) == ord $character
</pre>
<p class="Pp">will hold. (If Unicode code points were applied consistently over
    all the possible code points, pack(&quot;U&quot;,ord(&quot;A&quot;)) would
    in EBCDIC equal <i>A with acute</i> or chr(101), and unpack(&quot;U&quot;,
    &quot;A&quot;) would equal 65, or <i>non-breaking space</i>, not 193, or ord
    &quot;A&quot;.)</p>

UTF stands for <span class="Li">&quot;Unicode Transformation
  Format&quot;</span>. UTF-8 is an encoding of Unicode into a sequence of 8-bit
  byte chunks, based on ASCII and Latin-1. The length of a sequence required to
  represent a Unicode code point depends on the ordinal number of that code
  point, with larger numbers requiring more bytes. UTF-EBCDIC is like UTF-8, but
  based on EBCDIC.
<p class="Pp">You may see the term <span class="Li">&quot;invariant&quot;</span>
    character or code point. This simply means that the character has the same
    numeric value when encoded as when not. (Note that this is a very different
    concept from &quot;The 13 variant characters&quot; mentioned above.) For
    example, the ordinal value of 'A' is 193 in most EBCDIC code pages, and also
    is 193 when encoded in UTF-EBCDIC. All variant code points occupy at least
    two bytes when encoded. In UTF-8, the code points corresponding to the
    lowest 128 ordinal numbers (0 - 127: the ASCII characters) are invariant. In
    UTF-EBCDIC, there are 160 invariant characters. (If you care, the EBCDIC
    invariants are those characters which have ASCII equivalents, plus those
    that correspond to the C1 controls (80..9f on ASCII platforms).)</p>
<p class="Pp">A string encoded in UTF-EBCDIC may be longer (but never shorter)
    than one encoded in UTF-8.</p>

Starting from Perl 5.8 you can use the standard new module Encode to translate
  from EBCDIC to Latin-1 code points. Encode knows about more EBCDIC character
  sets than Perl can currently be compiled to run on.
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
   use Encode 'from_to';

   my %ebcdic = ( 176 =&gt; 'cp37', 95 =&gt; 'cp1047', 106 =&gt; 'posix-bc' );

   # $a is in EBCDIC code points
   from_to($a, $ebcdic{ord '^'}, 'latin1');
   # $a is ISO 8859-1 code points
</pre>
<p class="Pp">and from Latin-1 code points to EBCDIC code points</p>

   use Encode 'from_to';

   my %ebcdic = ( 176 =&gt; 'cp37', 95 =&gt; 'cp1047', 106 =&gt; 'posix-bc' );

   # $a is ISO 8859-1 code points
   from_to($a, 'latin1', $ebcdic{ord '^'});
   # $a is in EBCDIC code points
</pre>
<p class="Pp">For doing I/O it is suggested that you use the autotranslating
    features of PerlIO, see perluniintro.</p>
<p class="Pp">Since version 5.8 Perl uses the new PerlIO I/O library. This
    enables you to use different encodings per IO channel. For example you may
    use</p>

    open($f, &quot;&gt;:encoding(cp37)&quot;, &quot;test.ebcdic&quot;);
    print $f &quot;Hello World!\n&quot;;
    open($f, &quot;&gt;:encoding(latin1)&quot;, &quot;test.latin1&quot;);
    print $f &quot;Hello World!\n&quot;;
    open($f, &quot;&gt;:encoding(utf8)&quot;, &quot;test.utf8&quot;);
    print $f &quot;Hello World!\n&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">to get four files containing &quot;Hello World!\n&quot; in ASCII,
    CP 0037 EBCDIC, ISO 8859-1 (Latin-1) (in this example identical to ASCII
    since only ASCII characters were printed), and UTF-EBCDIC (in this example
    identical to normal EBCDIC since only characters that don't differ between
    EBCDIC and UTF-EBCDIC were printed). See the documentation of Encode::PerlIO
    for details.</p>
<p class="Pp">As the PerlIO layer uses raw IO (bytes) internally, all this

The following tables list the ASCII and Latin 1 ordered sets including the
  subsets: C0 controls (0..31), ASCII graphics (32..7e), delete (7f), C1
  controls (80..9f), and Latin-1 (a.k.a. ISO 8859-1) (a0..ff). In the table
  names of the Latin 1 extensions to ASCII have been labelled with character
  names roughly corresponding to <i>The Unicode Standard, Version 6.1</i> albeit
  with substitutions such as s/LATIN// and s/VULGAR// in all cases, s/CAPITAL
  LETTER// in some cases, and s/SMALL LETTER ([A-Z])/\l$1/ in some other cases.
  Controls are listed using their Unicode 6.1 abbreviatons. The differences
  between the 0037 and 1047 sets are flagged with **. The differences between
  the 1047 and POSIX-BC sets are flagged with ##. All <i>ord()</i> numbers

<h1 class="Sh" id="IDENTIFYING_CHARACTER_CODE_SETS"><a class="permalink" href="#IDENTIFYING_CHARACTER_CODE_SETS">IDENTIFYING
  CHARACTER CODE SETS</a></h1>
To determine the character set you are running under from perl one could use the
  return value of <i>ord()</i> or <i>chr()</i> to test one or more character
  values. For example:
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    $is_ascii  = &quot;A&quot; eq chr(65);
    $is_ebcdic = &quot;A&quot; eq chr(193);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Also, &quot;\t&quot; is a <span class="Li">&quot;HORIZONTAL
    TABULATION&quot;</span> character so that:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    $is_ascii  = ord(&quot;\t&quot;) == 9;
    $is_ebcdic = ord(&quot;\t&quot;) == 5;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">To distinguish EBCDIC code pages try looking at one or more of the
    characters that differ between them. For example:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    $is_ebcdic_37   = &quot;\n&quot; eq chr(37);
    $is_ebcdic_1047 = &quot;\n&quot; eq chr(21);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Or better still choose a character that is uniquely encoded in any
    of the code sets, e.g.:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    $is_ascii           = ord('[') == 91;
    $is_ebcdic_37       = ord('[') == 186;

    $is_ascii = &quot;\n&quot; ne chr(10);  #  ILL ADVISED

    note too that because &quot;\n&quot; is chr(13) and &quot;\r&quot; is
    chr(10) on the Macintosh (which is an ASCII platform) the second
    <span class="Li">$is_ascii</span> test will lead to trouble there.</p>
<p class="Pp">To determine whether or not perl was built under an EBCDIC code

In order to convert a string of characters from one character set to another a
  simple list of numbers, such as in the right columns in the above table, along
  with perl's tr/// operator is all that is needed. The data in the table are in
  ASCII/Latin1 order, hence the EBCDIC columns provide easy-to-use ASCII/Latin1
  to EBCDIC operations that are also easily reversed.
<p class="Pp">For example, to convert ASCII/Latin1 to code page 037 take the
    output of the second numbers column from the output of recipe 2 (modified to
    add '\' characters), and use it in tr/// like so:</p>

The <span class="Li">&quot;..&quot;</span> range operator treats certain
  character ranges with care on EBCDIC platforms. For example the following
  array will have twenty six elements on either an EBCDIC platform or an ASCII
  platform:
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    @alphabet = ('A'..'Z');   #  $#alphabet == 25
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The bitwise operators such as &amp; ^ | may return different
    results when operating on string or character data in a perl program running
    on an EBCDIC platform than when run on an ASCII platform. Here is an example
    adapted from the one in perlop:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    # EBCDIC-based examples
    print &quot;j p \n&quot; ^ &quot; a h&quot;;                      # prints &quot;JAPH\n&quot;
    print &quot;JA&quot; | &quot;  ph\n&quot;;                        # prints &quot;japh\n&quot;
    print &quot;JAPH\nJunk&quot; &amp; &quot;\277\277\277\277\277&quot;;  # prints &quot;japh\n&quot;;
    print 'p N$' ^ &quot; E&lt;H\n&quot;;                      # prints &quot;Perl\n&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">An interesting property of the 32 C0 control characters in the
    ASCII table is that they can &quot;literally&quot; be constructed as control
    characters in perl, e.g. <span class="Li">&quot;(chr(0)&quot;</span> eq
    <span class="Li">&quot;\c@&quot;</span>)&gt;
    <span class="Li">&quot;(chr(1)&quot;</span> eq
    <span class="Li">&quot;\cA&quot;</span>)&gt;, and so on. Perl on EBCDIC
    platforms has been ported to take <span class="Li">&quot;\c@&quot;</span> to
    <i>chr</i>(0) and <span class="Li">&quot;\cA&quot;</span> to <i>chr</i>(1),
    etc. as well, but the thirty three characters that result depend on which
    code page you are using. The table below uses the standard acronyms for the
    controls. The POSIX-BC and 1047 sets are identical throughout this range and
    differ from the 0037 set at only one spot (21 decimal). Note that the
    <span class="Li">&quot;LINE FEED&quot;</span> character may be generated by
    <span class="Li">&quot;\cJ&quot;</span> on ASCII platforms but by
    <span class="Li">&quot;\cU&quot;</span> on 1047 or POSIX-BC platforms and
    cannot be generated as a <span class="Li">&quot;\c.letter.&quot;</span>
    control character on 0037 platforms. Note also that
    <span class="Li">&quot;\c\&quot;</span> cannot be the final element in a
    string or regex, as it will absorb the terminator. But
    <span class="Li">&quot;\c\</span><i>X</i><span class="Li">&quot;</span> is a
    <span class="Li">&quot;FILE</span> <span class="Li">SEPARATOR&quot;</span>
    concatenated with <i>X</i> for all <i>X</i>.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="REGULAR_EXPRESSION_DIFFERENCES"><a class="permalink" href="#REGULAR_EXPRESSION_DIFFERENCES">REGULAR
  EXPRESSION DIFFERENCES</a></h1>
As of perl 5.005_03 the letter range regular expressions such as [A-Z] and [a-z]
  have been especially coded to not pick up gap characters. For example,
  characters such as o <span class="Li">&quot;o WITH CIRCUMFLEX&quot;</span>
  that lie between I and J would not be matched by the regular expression range
  <span class="Li">&quot;/[H-K]/&quot;</span>. This works in the other
  direction, too, if either of the range end points is explicitly numeric:
  <span class="Li">&quot;[\x89-\x91]&quot;</span> will match
  <span class="Li">&quot;\x8e&quot;</span>, even though
  <span class="Li">&quot;\x89&quot;</span> is
  <span class="Li">&quot;i&quot;</span> and <span class="Li">&quot;\x91
  &quot;</span> is <span class="Li">&quot;j&quot;</span>, and
  <span class="Li">&quot;\x8e&quot;</span> is a gap character from the
  alphabetic viewpoint.
<p class="Pp">If you do want to match the alphabet gap characters in a single
    octet regular expression try matching the hex or octal code such as
    <span class="Li">&quot;/\313/&quot;</span> on EBCDIC or
    <span class="Li">&quot;/\364/&quot;</span> on ASCII platforms to have your
    regular expression match <span class="Li">&quot;o WITH
    CIRCUMFLEX&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Another construct to be wary of is the inappropriate use of hex or
    octal constants in regular expressions. Consider the following set of
  subs:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    sub is_c0 {
        my $char = substr(shift,0,1);
        $char =~ /[\000-\037]/;
    }

    sub is_print_ascii {
        my $char = substr(shift,0,1);
        $char =~ /[\040-\176]/;
    }

    sub is_delete {
        my $char = substr(shift,0,1);
        $char eq &quot;\177&quot;;
    }

    sub is_c1 {
        my $char = substr(shift,0,1);
        $char =~ /[\200-\237]/;
    }

    sub is_latin_1 {
        my $char = substr(shift,0,1);
        $char =~ /[\240-\377]/;
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The above would be adequate if the concern was only with numeric
    code points. However, the concern may be with characters rather than code
    points and on an EBCDIC platform it may be desirable for constructs such as
    <span class="Li">&quot;if (is_print_ascii(&quot;A&quot;)) {print &quot;A is
    a printable character\n&quot;;}&quot;</span> to print out the expected
    message. One way to represent the above collection of character
    classification subs that is capable of working across the four coded
    character sets discussed in this document is as follows:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>

Most socket programming assumes ASCII character encodings in network byte order.
  Exceptions can include CGI script writing under a host web server where the
  server may take care of translation for you. Most host web servers convert
  EBCDIC data to ISO-8859-1 or Unicode on output.

<h1 class="Sh" id="SORTING"><a class="permalink" href="#SORTING">SORTING</a></h1>
One big difference between ASCII-based character sets and EBCDIC ones are the
  relative positions of upper and lower case letters and the letters compared to
  the digits. If sorted on an ASCII-based platform the two-letter abbreviation
  for a physician comes before the two letter abbreviation for drive; that is:
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
 @sorted = sort(qw(Dr. dr.));  # @sorted holds ('Dr.','dr.') on ASCII,
                                  # but ('dr.','Dr.') on EBCDIC
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The property of lowercase before uppercase letters in EBCDIC is
    even carried to the Latin 1 EBCDIC pages such as 0037 and 1047. An example
    would be that Ee <span class="Li">&quot;E WITH DIAERESIS&quot;</span> (203)
    comes before ee <span class="Li">&quot;e WITH DIAERESIS&quot;</span> (235)
    on an ASCII platform, but the latter (83) comes before the former (115) on
    an EBCDIC platform. (Astute readers will note that the uppercase version of
    ss <span class="Li">&quot;SMALL LETTER SHARP S&quot;</span> is simply
    &quot;SS&quot; and that the upper case version of ye
    <span class="Li">&quot;y WITH DIAERESIS&quot;</span> is not in the 0..255
    range but it is at U+x0178 in Unicode, or
    <span class="Li">&quot;\x{178}&quot;</span> in a Unicode enabled Perl).</p>
<p class="Pp">The sort order will cause differences between results obtained on
    ASCII platforms versus EBCDIC platforms. What follows are some suggestions
    on how to deal with these differences.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="_s-1MONO_CASE_s0_then_sort_data."><a class="permalink" href="#_s-1MONO_CASE_s0_then_sort_data.">MONO
  CASE then sort data.</a></h2>
In order to minimize the expense of mono casing mixed-case text, try to
  <span class="Li">&quot;tr///&quot;</span> towards the character set case most
  employed within the data. If the data are primarily UPPERCASE non Latin 1 then
  apply tr/[a-z]/[A-Z]/ then <i>sort()</i>. If the data are primarily lowercase
  non Latin 1 then apply tr/[A-Z]/[a-z]/ before sorting. If the data are
  primarily UPPERCASE and include Latin-1 characters then apply:
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
   tr/[a-z]/[A-Z]/;
   tr/[aaaa~aeaaaeceeeeeiiiied`n~oooo~oeouuuueyp]/[AAAA~AeAaAECEEEEeIIIIeD&#x2010;N~OOOO~OeOUUUUeYP/;
   s/ss/SS/g;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">then <i>sort()</i>. Do note however that such Latin-1 manipulation
    does not address the ye <span class="Li">&quot;y WITH DIAERESIS&quot;</span>
    character that will remain at code point 255 on ASCII platforms, but 223 on
    most EBCDIC platforms where it will sort to a place less than the EBCDIC
    numerals. With a Unicode-enabled Perl you might try:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    tr/^?/\x{178}/;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The strategy of mono casing data before sorting does not preserve
    the case of the data and may not be acceptable for that reason.</p>

  ciphers</a></h2>
The practice of shifting an alphabet one or more characters for encipherment
  dates back thousands of years and was explicitly detailed by Gaius Julius
  Caesar in his <b>Gallic Wars</b> text. A single alphabet shift is sometimes
  referred to as a rotation and the shift amount is given as a number
  <span class="Li">$n</span> after the string 'rot' or &quot;rot$n&quot;. Rot0
  and rot26 would designate identity maps on the 26-letter English version of
  the Latin alphabet. Rot13 has the interesting property that alternate
  subsequent invocations are identity maps (thus rot13 is its own non-trivial
  inverse in the group of 26 alphabet rotations). Hence the following is a rot13
  encoder and decoder that will work on ASCII and EBCDIC platforms:
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>

This pod document contains literal Latin 1 characters and may encounter
  translation difficulties. In particular one popular nroff implementation was
  known to strip accented characters to their unaccented counterparts while
  attempting to view this document through the <b>pod2man</b> program (for
  example, you may see a plain <span class="Li">&quot;y&quot;</span> rather than
  one with a diaeresis as in ye). Another nroff truncated the resultant manpage
  at the first occurrence of 8 bit characters.
<p class="Pp">Not all shells will allow multiple
