   The definitions below are for supplemental macros used in Tcl/Tk
   manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget.  The
  	options follow on successive lines, in four columns separated
  	by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   RCS: @(#) $Id: man.macros,v 1.1 2009/01/30 04:56:47 andreas_kupries Exp $
  
  	# Set up traps and other miscellaneous stuff for Tcl/Tk man pages.
  	# Start an argument description
  .b
  	# define tabbing values for .AP
  
  	# BS - start boxed text
  	# ^y = starting y location
  	# ^b = 1
  	# BE - end boxed text (draw box now)
  	Draw four-sided box normally, but don't draw top of
  	box if the box started on an earlier page.
  	# VS - start vertical sidebar
  	# ^Y = starting y location
  	# ^v = 1 (for troff;  for nroff this doesn't matter)
  	# VE - end of vertical sidebar
  	# Special macro to handle page bottom:  finish off current
  	# box/sidebar if in box/sidebar mode, then invoked standard
  	# page bottom macro.
  	Draw three-sided box if this is the box's first page,
  	draw two sides but no top otherwise.
  	# DS - begin display
  	# DE - end display
  	# SO - start of list of standard options
  	# SE - end of list of standard options
  	# OP - start of full description for a single option
  	# CS - begin code excerpt
  	# CE - end code excerpt

This package provides objects holding enough information to enable them to
  either actively connect to a counterpart, or to passively wait for a
  connection from said counterpart. I.e. any object created by this packages is
  always in one of two complementary modes, called <i>active</i> (the object
  initiates the connection) and <i>passive</i> (the object receives the
  connection).
<p class="Pp">Of the two objects in a connecting pair one has to be configured
    for <i>active</i> mode, and the other then has to be configured for
    <i>passive</i> mode. This establishes which of the two partners connects to
    whom (the <i>active</i> to the other), or, who is waiting on whom (the
    <i>passive</i> on the other). Note that this is completely independent of
    the direction of any data transmission using the connection after it has
    been established. An active object can, after establishing the connection,
    either transmit or receive data. Equivalently the passive object can do the
    same after the waiting for its partner has ended.</p>

  COMMANDS</a></h2>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>transfer::connect</b> <i>objectName</i> ?<i>options</i>...?</dt>
  <dd>This command creates a new connection object with an associated Tcl
      command whose name is <i>objectName</i>. This <i>object</i> command is
      explained in full detail in the sections <b>Object command</b> and
      <b>Object methods</b>. The set of supported <i>options</i> is explained in
      section <b>Options</b>.
    <p class="Pp">The object command will be created under the current namespace
        if the <i>objectName</i> is not fully qualified, and in the specified
        namespace otherwise. The fully qualified name of the object command is
        returned as the result of the command.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="OBJECT_COMMAND"><a class="permalink" href="#OBJECT_COMMAND">OBJECT
  COMMAND</a></h2>
All objects created by the <b>::transfer::connect</b> command have the following
  general form:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><i>objectName</i> <b>method</b> ?<i>arg arg ...</i>?</dt>
  <dd>The method <b>method</b> and its <i>arg</i>'uments determine the exact
      behavior of the command. See section <b>Object methods</b> for the
      detailed specifications.</dd>
</dl>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="OBJECT_METHODS"><a class="permalink" href="#OBJECT_METHODS">OBJECT
  METHODS</a></h2>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><i>objectName</i> <b>destroy</b></dt>
  <dd>This method destroys the object. This is safe to do for an <i>active</i>
      object when a connection has been started, as the completion callback is
      synchronous. For a <i>passive</i> object currently waiting for its partner
      to establish the connection however this is not safe and will cause errors
      later on, when the connection setup completes and tries to access the now
      missing data structures of the destroyed object.</dd>
  <dt><i>objectName</i> <b>connect</b> <i>command</i></dt>
  <dd>This method starts the connection setup per the configuration of the
      object. When the connection is established the callback <i>command</i>
      will be invoked with one additional argument, the channel handle of the
      socket over which data can be transfered.
    <p class="Pp">The detailed behaviour of the method depends on the configured
        mode.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><i>active</i></dt>
  <dd>The connection setup is done synchronously. The object waits until the
      connection is established. The method returns the empty string as its
      result.</dd>
  <dt><i>passive</i></dt>
  <dd>The connection setup is done asynchronously. The method returns
      immediately after a listening socket has been set up. The connection will
      be established in the background. The method returns the port number of
      the listening socket, for use by the caller. One important use is the
      transfer of this information to the counterpart so that it knows where it
      has to connect to.
    <p class="Pp">This is necessary as the object might have been configured for
        port <b>0</b>, allowing the operating system to choose the actual port
        it will listen on.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The listening port is closed immediately when the connection
        was established by the partner, to keep the time interval small within
        which a third party can connect to the port too. Even so it is
        recommended to use additional measures in the protocol outside of the
        connect and transfer object to ensure that a connection is not used with
        an unidentified/unauthorized partner One possibility for this is the use
        of SSL/TLS. See the option <b>-socketcmd</b> and section <b>Secure
        connections</b> for information on how to do this.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="OPTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h2>
Connection objects support the set of options listed below.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>-mode</b> <i>mode</i></dt>
  <dd>This option specifies the mode the object is in. It is optional and
      defaults to <b>active</b> mode. The two possible modes are:</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>active</b></dt>
  <dd>In this mode the two options <b>-host</b> and <b>-port</b> are relevant
      and specify the host and TCP port the object has to connect to. The host
      is given by either name or IP address.</dd>
  <dt><b>passive</b></dt>
  <dd>In this mode the option <b>-host</b> has no relevance and is ignored
      should it be configured. The only option the object needs is <b>-port</b>,
      and it specifies the TCP port on which the listening socket is opened to
      await the connection from the partner.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>-host</b> <i>hostname-or-ipaddr</i></dt>
  <dd>This option specifies the host to connect to in <i>active</i> mode, either
      by name or ip-address. An object configured for <i>passive</i> mode
      ignores this option.</dd>
  <dt><b>-port</b> <i>int</i></dt>
  <dd>For <i>active</i> mode this option specifies the port the object is
      expected to connect to. For <i>passive</i> mode however it is the port
      where the object creates the listening socket waiting for a connection. It
      defaults to <b>0</b>, which allows the OS to choose the actual port to
      listen on.</dd>
  <dt><b>-socketcmd</b> <i>command</i></dt>
  <dd>This option allows the user to specify which command to use to open a
      socket. The default is to use the builtin <b>::socket</b>. Any compatible
      with that command is allowed.
    <p class="Pp">The envisioned main use is the specfication of
        <b>tls::socket</b>. I.e. this option allows the creation of secure
        transfer channels, without making this package explicitly dependent on
        the <b>tls</b> package.</p>
    <p class="Pp">See also section <b>Secure connections</b>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>-encoding</b> encodingname</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>-eofchar</b> eofspec</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>-translation</b> transspec</dt>
  <dd>These options are the same as are recognized by the builtin command
      <b>fconfigure</b>. They provide the configuration to be set for the
      channel between the two partners after it has been established, but before
      the callback is invoked (See method <b>connect</b>).</dd>

<h1 class="Sh" id="SECURE_CONNECTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#SECURE_CONNECTIONS">SECURE
  CONNECTIONS</a></h1>
One way to secure connections made by objects of this package is to require the
  package <b>tls</b> and then configure the option <b>-socketcmd</b> to force
  the use of command <b>tls::socket</b> to open the socket.
<pre>
    # Load and initialize tls
    package require tls
    tls::init -cafile /path/to/ca/cert -keyfile ...
    # Create a connector with secure socket setup,
    transfer::connect C -socketcmd tls::socket ...
    ...
