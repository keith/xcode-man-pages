<p class="Pp">The <code class="Nm">stf</code> interface supports
    &#x201C;6to4&#x201D; IPv6 in IPv4 encapsulation. It can tunnel IPv6 traffic
    over IPv4, as specified in <code class="Li">RFC3056</code>.</p>
<p class="Pp">For ordinary nodes in 6to4 site, you do not need
    <code class="Nm">stf</code> interface. The <code class="Nm">stf</code>
    interface is necessary for site border router (called &#x201C;6to4
    router&#x201D; in the specification).</p>
<p class="Pp">Due to the way 6to4 protocol is specified,
    <code class="Nm">stf</code> interface requires certain configuration to work
    properly. Single (no more than 1) valid 6to4 address needs to be configured
    to the interface. &#x201C;A valid 6to4 address&#x201D; is an address which
    has the following properties. If any of the following properties are not
    satisfied, <code class="Nm">stf</code> raises runtime error on packet
    transmission. Read the specification for more details.</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>matches <code class="Li">2002:xxyy:zzuu::/48</code> where
      <code class="Li">xxyy:zzuu</code> is a hexadecimal notation of an IPv4
      address for the node. IPv4 address can be taken from any of interfaces
      your node has. Since the specification forbids the use of IPv4 private
      address, the address needs to be a global IPv4 address.</li>
  <li>Subnet identifier portion (48th to 63rd bit) and interface identifier
      portion (lower 64 bits) are properly filled to avoid address
    collisions.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">If you would like the node to behave as a relay router, the prefix
    length for the IPv6 interface address needs to be 16 so that the node would
    consider any 6to4 destination as &#x201C;on-link&#x201D;. If you would like
    to restrict 6to4 peers to be inside certain IPv4 prefix, you may want to
    configure IPv6 prefix length as &#x201C;16 + IPv4 prefix length&#x201D;.
    <code class="Nm">stf</code> interface will check the IPv4 source address on
    packets, if the IPv6 prefix length is larger than 16.</p>
<p class="Pp"><code class="Nm">stf</code> can be configured to be ECN friendly.
    This can be configured by <code class="Dv">IFF_LINK1</code>. See
    <a class="Xr">gif(4)</a> for details.</p>
<p class="Pp">Please note that 6to4 specification is written as &#x201C;accept
    tunnelled packet from everyone&#x201D; tunnelling device. By enabling
    <code class="Nm">stf</code> device, you are making it much easier for
    malicious parties to inject fabricated IPv6 packet to your node. Also,
    malicious party can inject an IPv6 packet with fabricated source address to
    make your node generate improper tunnelled packet. Administrators must take
    caution when enabling the interface. To prevent possible attacks,
    <code class="Nm">stf</code> interface filters out the following packets.
    Note that the checks are no way complete:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Packets with IPv4 unspecified address as outer IPv4 source/destination
      (<code class="Li">0.0.0.0/8</code>)</li>
  <li>Packets with loopback address as outer IPv4 source/destination
      (<code class="Li">127.0.0.0/8</code>)</li>
  <li>Packets with IPv4 multicast address as outer IPv4 source/destination
      (<code class="Li">224.0.0.0/4</code>)</li>
  <li>Packets with limited broadcast address as outer IPv4 source/destination
      (<code class="Li">255.0.0.0/8</code>)</li>
  <li>Packets with subnet broadcast address as outer IPv4 source/destination.
      The check is made against subnet broadcast addresses for all of the
      directly connected subnets.</li>
  <li>Packets that does not pass ingress filtering. Outer IPv4 source address
      must meet the IPv4 topology on the routing table. Ingress filter can be
      turned off by <code class="Dv">IFF_LINK2</code> bit.</li>
  <li>The same set of rules are applied against the IPv4 address embedded into
      inner IPv6 address, if the IPv6 address matches 6to4 prefix.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">It is recommended to filter/audit incoming IPv4 packet with IP
    protocol number 41, as necessary. It is also recommended to filter/audit
    encapsulated IPv6 packets as well. You may also want to run normal ingress
    filter against inner IPv6 address to avoid spoofing.</p>
<p class="Pp">By setting the <code class="Dv">IFF_LINK0</code> flag on the
    <code class="Nm">stf</code> interface, it is possible to disable the input
    path, making the direct attacks from the outside impossible. Note, however,
    there are other security risks exist. If you wish to use the configuration,
    you must not advertise your 6to4 address to others.</p>

<p class="Pp">Note that <code class="Li">8504:0506</code> is equal to
    <code class="Li">133.4.5.6</code>, written in hexadecimals.</p>

<p class="Pp">The following configuration accepts packets from IPv4 source
    <code class="Li">9.1.0.0/16</code> only. It emits 6to4 packet only for IPv6
    destination 2002:0901::/32 (IPv4 destination will match
    <code class="Li">9.1.0.0/16</code>).</p>

</div>
<p class="Pp">The following configuration uses the <code class="Nm">stf</code>
    interface as an output-only device. You need to have alternative IPv6
    connectivity (other than 6to4) to use this configuration. For outbound
    traffic, you can reach other 6to4 networks efficiently via
    <code class="Nm">stf</code>. For inbound traffic, you will not receive any
    6to4-tunneled packets (less security drawbacks). Be careful not to advertise
    your 6to4 prefix to others (<code class="Li">2002:8504:0506::/48</code>),
    and not to use your 6to4 prefix as a source.</p>

<p class="Pp">No more than one <code class="Nm">stf</code> interface is allowed
    for a node, and no more than one IPv6 interface address is allowed for an
    <code class="Nm">stf</code> interface. It is to avoid source address
    selection conflicts between IPv6 layer and IPv4 layer, and to cope with
    ingress filtering rule on the other side. This is a feature to make
    <code class="Nm">stf</code> work right for all occasions.</p>
