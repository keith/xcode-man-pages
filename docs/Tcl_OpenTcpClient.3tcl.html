   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">These functions are convenience procedures for creating channels
    that communicate over TCP sockets. The operations on a channel are described
    in the manual entry for <b>Tcl_OpenFileChannel</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="TCL_OPENTCPCLIENT"><a class="permalink" href="#TCL_OPENTCPCLIENT">TCL_OPENTCPCLIENT</a></h1>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_OpenTcpClient</b> opens a client TCP socket connected to a
    <i>port</i> on a specific <i>host</i>, and returns a channel that can be
    used to communicate with the server. The host to connect to can be specified
    either as a domain name style name (e.g. <b>www.sunlabs.com</b>), or as a
    string containing the alphanumeric representation of its four-byte address
    (e.g. <b>127.0.0.1</b>). Use the string <b>localhost</b> to connect to a TCP
    socket on the host on which the function is invoked.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>myaddr</i> and <i>myport</i> arguments allow a client to
    specify an address for the local end of the connection. If <i>myaddr</i> is
    NULL, then an interface is chosen automatically by the operating system. If
    <i>myport</i> is 0, then a port number is chosen at random by the operating
    system.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <i>async</i> is zero, the call to <b>Tcl_OpenTcpClient</b>
    returns only after the client socket has either successfully connected to
    the server, or the attempted connection has failed. If <i>async</i> is
    nonzero the socket is connected asynchronously and the returned channel may
    not yet be connected to the server when the call to <b>Tcl_OpenTcpClient</b>
    returns. If the channel is in blocking mode and an input or output operation
    is done on the channel before the connection is completed or fails, that
    operation will wait until the connection either completes successfully or
    fails. If the channel is in nonblocking mode, the input or output operation
    will return immediately and a subsequent call to <b>Tcl_InputBlocked</b> on
    the channel will return nonzero.</p>
<p class="Pp">The returned channel is opened for reading and writing. If an
    error occurs in opening the socket, <b>Tcl_OpenTcpClient</b> returns NULL
    and records a POSIX error code that can be retrieved with
    <b>Tcl_GetErrno</b>. In addition, if <i>interp</i> is non-NULL, an error
    message is left in the interpreter's result.</p>
<p class="Pp">The newly created channel is not registered in the supplied
    interpreter; to register it, use <b>Tcl_RegisterChannel</b>. If one of the
    standard channels, <b>stdin, stdout</b> or <b>stderr</b> was previously
    closed, the act of creating the new channel also assigns it as a replacement
    for the standard channel.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="TCL_MAKETCPCLIENTCHANNEL"><a class="permalink" href="#TCL_MAKETCPCLIENTCHANNEL">TCL_MAKETCPCLIENTCHANNEL</a></h1>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_MakeTcpClientChannel</b> creates a <b>Tcl_Channel</b>
    around an existing, platform specific, handle for a client TCP socket.</p>
<p class="Pp">The newly created channel is not registered in the supplied
    interpreter; to register it, use <b>Tcl_RegisterChannel</b>. If one of the
    standard channels, <b>stdin, stdout</b> or <b>stderr</b> was previously
    closed, the act of creating the new channel also assigns it as a replacement
    for the standard channel.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="TCL_OPENTCPSERVER"><a class="permalink" href="#TCL_OPENTCPSERVER">TCL_OPENTCPSERVER</a></h1>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_OpenTcpServer</b> opens a TCP socket on the local host on a
    specified <i>port</i> and uses the Tcl event mechanism to accept requests
    from clients to connect to it. The <i>myaddr</i> argument specifies the
    network interface. If <i>myaddr</i> is NULL the special address INADDR_ANY
    should be used to allow connections from any network interface. Each time a
    client connects to this socket, Tcl creates a channel for the new connection
    and invokes <i>proc</i> with information about the channel. <i>Proc</i> must
    match the following prototype:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
typedef void Tcl_TcpAcceptProc(
<br/>
        ClientData <i>clientData</i>,
<br/>
        Tcl_Channel <i>channel</i>,
<br/>
        char *<i>hostName</i>,
<br/>
        int <i>port</i>);</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The <i>clientData</i> argument will be the same as the
    <i>clientData</i> argument to <b>Tcl_OpenTcpServer</b>, <i>channel</i> will
    be the handle for the new channel, <i>hostName</i> points to a string
    containing the name of the client host making the connection, and
    <i>port</i> will contain the client's port number. The new channel is opened
    for both input and output. If <i>proc</i> raises an error, the connection is
    closed automatically. <i>Proc</i> has no return value, but if it wishes to
    reject the connection it can close <i>channel</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_OpenTcpServer</b> normally returns a pointer to a channel
    representing the server socket. If an error occurs, <b>Tcl_OpenTcpServer</b>
    returns NULL and records a POSIX error code that can be retrieved with
    <b>Tcl_GetErrno</b>. In addition, if the interpreter is non-NULL, an error
    message is left in the interpreter's result.</p>
<p class="Pp">The channel returned by <b>Tcl_OpenTcpServer</b> cannot be used
    for either input or output. It is simply a handle for the socket used to
    accept connections. The caller can close the channel to shut down the server
    and disallow further connections from new clients.</p>
<p class="Pp">TCP server channels operate correctly only in applications that
    dispatch events through <b>Tcl_DoOneEvent</b> or through Tcl commands such
    as <b>vwait</b>; otherwise Tcl will never notice that a connection request
    from a remote client is pending.</p>
<p class="Pp">The newly created channel is not registered in the supplied
    interpreter; to register it, use <b>Tcl_RegisterChannel</b>. If one of the
    standard channels, <b>stdin, stdout</b> or <b>stderr</b> was previously
    closed, the act of creating the new channel also assigns it as a replacement
    for the standard channel.</p>

    socket handle is a <b>SOCKET</b> as defined in the WinSock API.</p>
