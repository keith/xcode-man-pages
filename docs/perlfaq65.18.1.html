    littered with answers involving regular expressions. For example, decoding a
    URL and checking whether something is a number can be handled with regular
    expressions, but those answers are found elsewhere in this document (in
    perlfaq9: &quot;How do I decode or create those %-encodings on the web&quot;

  <dd>The <span class="Li">&quot;/x&quot;</span> modifier causes whitespace to

  <dd>While we normally think of patterns as being delimited with
      <span class="Li">&quot;/&quot;</span> characters, they can be delimited by
      almost any character. perlre describes this. For example, the
      <span class="Li">&quot;s///&quot;</span> above uses braces as delimiters.
      Selecting another delimiter can avoid quoting the delimiter within the
      pattern:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    s/\/usr\/local/\/usr\/share/g;    # bad delimiter choice
    s#/usr/local#/usr/share#g;        # better

    <p class="Pp">Using logically paired delimiters can be even more
      readable:</p>

  having trouble matching over more than one line. What's wrong?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Either you don't have more than one line in the string you're
    looking at (probably), or else you aren't using the correct modifier(s) on
    your pattern (possibly).</p>
<p class="Pp">There are many ways to get multiline data into a string. If you
    want it to happen automatically while reading input, you'll want to set $/
    (probably to '' for paragraphs or <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span>
    for the whole file) to allow you to read more than one line at a time.</p>
<p class="Pp">Read perlre to help you decide which of
    <span class="Li">&quot;/s&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;/m&quot;</span> (or both) you might want to use:
    <span class="Li">&quot;/s&quot;</span> allows dot to include newline, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;/m&quot;</span> allows caret and dollar to match next
    to a newline, not just at the end of the string. You do need to make sure
    that you've actually got a multiline string in there.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, this program detects duplicate words, even when they
    span line breaks (but not paragraph ones). For this example, we don't need
    <span class="Li">&quot;/s&quot;</span> because we aren't using dot in a
    regular expression that we want to cross line boundaries. Neither do we need
    <span class="Li">&quot;/m&quot;</span> because we don't want caret or dollar
    to match at any point inside the record next to newlines. But it's
    imperative that $/ be set to something other than the default, or else we
    won't actually ever have a multiline record read in.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    $/ = '';          # read in whole paragraph, not just one line
    while ( &lt;&gt; ) {
        while ( /\b([\w'-]+)(\s+\g1)+\b/gi ) {     # word starts alpha
            print &quot;Duplicate $1 at paragraph $.\n&quot;;
        }
    }

<p class="Pp">Here's some code that finds sentences that begin with &quot;From

    are good starts, although each namespace has other parsing modules

<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    $_= &quot;this is a TEsT case&quot;;
    $old = 'test';

    s{(\Q$old\E)}

    $string =~ s/(test)/preserve_case($1, &quot;success&quot;)/egi;
    print &quot;$string\n&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This prints:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    this is a SUcCESS case
</pre>
<p class="Pp">As an alternative, to keep the case of the replacement word if it
    is longer than the original, you can use this code, by Jeff Pinyan:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    sub preserve_case {
        my ($from, $to) = @_;
        my ($lf, $lt) = map length, @_;

        return uc $to | ($from ^ uc $from);
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This changes the sentence to &quot;this is a SUcCess
  case.&quot;</p>
<p class="Pp">Just to show that C programmers can write C in any programming
    language, if you prefer a more C-like solution, the following script makes
    the substitution have the same case, letter by letter, as the original. (It
    also happens to run about 240% slower than the Perlish solution runs.) If
    the substitution has more characters than the string being substituted, the
    case of the last character is used for the rest of the substitution.</p>

<p class="Pp">The Perl parser will expand <span class="Li">$variable</span> and
    <span class="Li">@variable</span> references in regular expressions unless
    the delimiter is a single quote. Remember, too, that the right-hand side of
    a <span class="Li">&quot;s///&quot;</span> substitution is considered a
    double-quoted string (see perlop for more details). Remember also that any
    regex special characters will be acted on unless you precede the
    substitution with \Q. Here's an example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    $string = &quot;Placido P. Octopus&quot;;
    $regex  = &quot;P.&quot;;
    $string =~ s/$regex/Polyp/;

<p class="Pp">Because <span class="Li">&quot;.&quot;</span> is special in
    regular expressions, and can match any single character, the regex
    <span class="Li">&quot;P.&quot;</span> here has matched the &lt;Pl&gt; in
    the original string.</p>
<p class="Pp">To escape the special meaning of
    <span class="Li">&quot;.&quot;</span>, we use
    <span class="Li">&quot;\Q&quot;</span>:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    $string = &quot;Placido P. Octopus&quot;;
    $regex  = &quot;P.&quot;;
    $string =~ s/\Q$regex/Polyp/;
    # $string is now &quot;Placido Polyp Octopus&quot;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The use of <span class="Li">&quot;\Q&quot;</span> causes the
    &lt;.&gt; in the regex to be treated as a regular character, so that
    <span class="Li">&quot;P.&quot;</span> matches a
    <span class="Li">&quot;P&quot;</span> followed by a dot.</p>

<p class="Pp">(contributed by brian d foy)</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;/o&quot;</span> option for regular
    expressions (documented in perlop and perlreref) tells Perl to compile the
    regular expression only once. This is only useful when the pattern contains
    a variable. Perls 5.6 and later handle this automatically if the pattern
    does not change.</p>
<p class="Pp">Since the match operator <span class="Li">&quot;m//&quot;</span>,
    the substitution operator <span class="Li">&quot;s///&quot;</span>, and the
    regular expression quoting operator <span class="Li">&quot;qr//&quot;</span>
    are double-quotish constructs, you can interpolate variables into the
    pattern. See the answer to &quot;How can I quote a variable to use in a
    regex?&quot; for more details.</p>
<p class="Pp">This example takes a regular expression from the argument list and
    prints the lines of input that match it:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    my $pattern = shift @ARGV;
    while( &lt;&gt; ) {
        print if m/$pattern/;
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Versions of Perl prior to 5.6 would recompile the regular
    expression for each iteration, even if <span class="Li">$pattern</span> had
    not changed. The <span class="Li">&quot;/o&quot;</span> would prevent this
    by telling Perl to compile the pattern the first time, then reuse that for
    subsequent iterations:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    my $pattern = shift @ARGV;
    while( &lt;&gt; ) {
        print if m/$pattern/o; # useful for Perl &lt; 5.6
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">In versions 5.6 and later, Perl won't recompile the regular
    expression if the variable hasn't changed, so you probably don't need the
    <span class="Li">&quot;/o&quot;</span> option. It doesn't hurt, but it
    doesn't help either. If you want any version of Perl to compile the regular
    expression only once even if the variable changes (thus, only using its
    initial value), you still need the
  <span class="Li">&quot;/o&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can watch Perl's regular expression engine at work to verify
    for yourself if Perl is recompiling a regular expression. The
    <span class="Li">&quot;use re</span> <span class="Li">'debug'&quot;</span>
    pragma (comes with Perl 5.005 and later) shows the details. With Perls
    before 5.6, you should see <span class="Li">&quot;re&quot;</span> reporting
    that its compiling the regular expression on each iteration. With Perl 5.6
    or later, you should only see <span class="Li">&quot;re&quot;</span> report
    that for the first iteration.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Can_I_use_Perl_regular_expressions_to_match_balanced_text?"><a class="permalink" href="#Can_I_use_Perl_regular_expressions_to_match_balanced_text?">Can
  I use Perl regular expressions to match balanced text?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">(contributed by brian d foy)</p>
<p class="Pp">Your first try should probably be the Text::Balanced module, which
    is in the Perl standard library since Perl 5.8. It has a variety of
    functions to deal with tricky text. The Regexp::Common module can also help
    by providing canned patterns you can use.</p>
<p class="Pp">As of Perl 5.10, you can match balanced text with regular
    expressions using recursive patterns. Before Perl 5.10, you had to resort to
    various tricks such as using Perl code in
    <span class="Li">&quot;(??{})&quot;</span> sequences.</p>
<p class="Pp">Here's an example using a recursive regular expression. The goal
    is to capture all of the text within angle brackets, including the text in
    nested angle brackets. This sample text has two &quot;major&quot; groups: a
    group with one level of nesting and a group with two levels of nesting.
    There are five total groups in angle brackets:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    I have some &lt;brackets in &lt;nested brackets&gt; &gt; and
    &lt;another group &lt;nested once &lt;nested twice&gt; &gt; &gt;
    and that's it.
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The regular expression to match the balanced text uses two new (to
    Perl 5.10) regular expression features. These are covered in perlre and this
    example is a modified version of one in that documentation.</p>
<p class="Pp">First, adding the new possessive
    <span class="Li">&quot;+&quot;</span> to any quantifier finds the longest
    match and does not backtrack. That's important since you want to handle any
    angle brackets through the recursion, not backtracking. The group
    <span class="Li">&quot;[^&lt;&gt;]++&quot;</span> finds one or more
    non-angle brackets without backtracking.</p>
<p class="Pp">Second, the new <span class="Li">&quot;(?PARNO)&quot;</span>
    refers to the sub-pattern in the particular capture group given by
    <span class="Li">&quot;PARNO&quot;</span>. In the following regex, the first
    capture group finds (and remembers) the balanced text, and you need that
    same pattern within the first buffer to get past the nested text. That's the
    recursive part. The <span class="Li">&quot;(?1)&quot;</span> uses the
    pattern in the outer capture group as an independent part of the regex.</p>
<p class="Pp">Putting it all together, you have:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    #!/usr/local/bin/perl5.10.0
    my $string =&lt;&lt;&quot;HERE&quot;;
    I have some &lt;brackets in &lt;nested brackets&gt; &gt; and
    &lt;another group &lt;nested once &lt;nested twice&gt; &gt; &gt;
    and that's it.
    HERE
    my @groups = $string =~ m/
            (                   # start of capture group 1
            &lt;                   # match an opening angle bracket
                (?:
                    [^&lt;&gt;]++     # one or more non angle brackets, non backtracking
                      |
                    (?1)        # found &lt; or &gt;, so recurse to capture group 1
                )*
            &gt;                   # match a closing angle bracket
            )                   # end of capture group 1
            /xg;
    $&quot; = &quot;\n\t&quot;;
    print &quot;Found:\n\t@groups\n&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The output shows that Perl found the two major groups:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>

        &lt;brackets in &lt;nested brackets&gt; &gt;
        &lt;another group &lt;nested once &lt;nested twice&gt; &gt; &gt;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">With a little extra work, you can get the all of the groups in
    angle brackets even if they are in other angle brackets too. Each time you
    get a balanced match, remove its outer delimiter (that's the one you just
    matched so don't match it again) and add it to a queue of strings to
    process. Keep doing that until you get no matches:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    #!/usr/local/bin/perl5.10.0
    my @queue =&lt;&lt;&quot;HERE&quot;;
    I have some &lt;brackets in &lt;nested brackets&gt; &gt; and
    &lt;another group &lt;nested once &lt;nested twice&gt; &gt; &gt;
    and that's it.
    HERE
    my $regex = qr/
            (                   # start of bracket 1

                    [^&lt;&gt;]++     # one or more non angle brackets, non backtracking
                      |
                    (?1)        # recurse to bracket 1
                )*
            &gt;                   # match a closing angle bracket
            )                   # end of bracket 1
            /x;

        my @groups = $string =~ m/$regex/g;
        print &quot;Found:\n\t@groups\n\n&quot; if @groups;
        unshift @queue, map { s/^&lt;//; s/&gt;$//; $_ } @groups;
    }

  does it mean that regexes are greedy? How can I get around it?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Most people mean that greedy regexes match as much as they can.
    Technically speaking, it's actually the quantifiers
    (<span class="Li">&quot;?&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;*&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;+&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;{}&quot;</span>) that are greedy rather than the
    whole pattern; Perl prefers local greed and immediate gratification to
    overall greed. To get non-greedy versions of the same quantifiers, use
    (<span class="Li">&quot;??&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;*?&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;+?&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;{}?&quot;</span>).</p>
<p class="Pp">An example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    my $s1 = my $s2 = &quot;I am very very cold&quot;;
    $s1 =~ s/ve.*y //;      # I am cold
    $s2 =~ s/ve.*?y //;     # I am very cold
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Notice how the second substitution stopped matching as soon as it
    encountered &quot;y &quot;. The <span class="Li">&quot;*?&quot;</span>
    quantifier effectively tells the regular expression engine to find a match
    as quickly as possible and pass control on to whatever is next in line, as
    you would if you were playing hot potato.</p>

<p class="Pp">(contributed by brian d foy)</p>
<p class="Pp">If you have Perl 5.10 or later, this is almost trivial. You just
    smart match against an array of regular expression objects:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    my @patterns = ( qr/Fr.d/, qr/B.rn.y/, qr/W.lm./ );
    if( $string ~~ @patterns ) {
        ...
    };
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The smart match stops when it finds a match, so it doesn't have to
    try every expression.</p>
<p class="Pp">Earlier than Perl 5.10, you have a bit of work to do. You want to
    avoid compiling a regular expression every time you want to match it. In
    this example, perl must recompile the regular expression for every iteration
    of the <span class="Li">&quot;foreach&quot;</span> loop since it has no way
    to know what <span class="Li">$pattern</span> will be:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    my @patterns = qw( foo bar baz );
    LINE: while( &lt;DATA&gt; ) {
        foreach $pattern ( @patterns ) {
            if( /\b$pattern\b/i ) {
                print;
                next LINE;
            }
        }
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;qr//&quot;</span> operator showed up in
    perl 5.005. It compiles a regular expression, but doesn't apply it. When you
    use the pre-compiled version of the regex, perl does less work. In this
    example, I inserted a <span class="Li">&quot;map&quot;</span> to turn each
    pattern into its pre-compiled form. The rest of the script is the same, but
    faster:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    my @patterns = map { qr/\b$_\b/i } qw( foo bar baz );
    LINE: while( &lt;&gt; ) {
        foreach $pattern ( @patterns ) {
            if( /$pattern/ ) {
                print;
                next LINE;
            }
        }
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">In some cases, you may be able to make several patterns into a
    single regular expression. Beware of situations that require backtracking
    though.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    my $regex = join '|', qw( foo bar baz );
    LINE: while( &lt;&gt; ) {
        print if /\b(?:$regex)\b/i;
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">For more details on regular expression efficiency, see
    <i>Mastering</i> <i>Regular Expressions</i> by Jeffrey Friedl. He explains

<p class="Pp">Ensure that you know what \b really does: it's the boundary
    between a word character, \w, and something that isn't a word character.
    That thing that isn't a word character might be \W, but it can also be the
    start or end of the string.</p>
<p class="Pp">It's not (not!) the boundary between whitespace and
    non-whitespace, and it's not the stuff between words we use to create
    sentences.</p>
<p class="Pp">In regex speak, a word boundary (\b) is a &quot;zero width
    assertion&quot;, meaning that it doesn't represent a character in the
    string, but a condition at a certain position.</p>
<p class="Pp">For the regular expression, /\bPerl\b/, there has to be a word
    boundary before the &quot;P&quot; and after the &quot;l&quot;. As long as
    something other than a word character precedes the &quot;P&quot; and
    succeeds the &quot;l&quot;, the pattern will match. These strings match

<p class="Pp">You don't have to use \b to match words though. You can look for

  does using $&amp;, $`, or $' slow my program down?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">(contributed by Anno Siegel)</p>
<p class="Pp">Once Perl sees that you need one of these variables anywhere in
    the program, it provides them on each and every pattern match. That means
    that on every pattern match the entire string will be copied, part of it to
    $`, part to $&amp;, and part to $'. Thus the penalty is most severe with
    long strings and patterns that match often. Avoid $&amp;, $', and $` if you
    can, but if you can't, once you've used them at all, use them at will
    because you've already paid the price. Remember that some algorithms really
    appreciate them. As of the 5.005 release, the $&amp; variable is no longer
    &quot;expensive&quot; the way the other two are.</p>
<p class="Pp">Since Perl 5.6.1 the special variables @- and @+ can functionally
    replace $`, $&amp; and $'. These arrays contain pointers to the beginning
    and end of each match (see perlvar for the full story), so they give you
    essentially the same information, but without the risk of excessive string
    copying.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl 5.10 added three specials,
    <span class="Li">&quot;${^MATCH}&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;${^PREMATCH}&quot;</span>, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;${^POSTMATCH}&quot;</span> to do the same job but
    without the global performance penalty. Perl 5.10 only sets these variables
    if you compile or execute the regular expression with the
    <span class="Li">&quot;/p&quot;</span> modifier.</p>

    with this anchor, so <span class="Li">&quot;\G&quot;</span> is similar to
    the beginning of string anchor, <span class="Li">&quot;^&quot;</span>. The
    <span class="Li">&quot;\G&quot;</span> anchor is typically used with the
    <span class="Li">&quot;g&quot;</span> flag. It uses the value of
    <span class="Li">&quot;pos()&quot;</span> as the position to start the next
    match. As the match operator makes successive matches, it updates
    <span class="Li">&quot;pos()&quot;</span> with the position of the next
    character past the last match (or the first character of the next match,
    depending on how you like to look at it). Each string has its own
    <span class="Li">&quot;pos()&quot;</span> value.</p>
<p class="Pp">Suppose you want to match all of consecutive pairs of digits in a
    string like &quot;1122a44&quot; and stop matching when you encounter
    non-digits. You want to match <span class="Li">11</span> and
    <span class="Li">22</span> but the letter &lt;a&gt; shows up between
    <span class="Li">22</span> and <span class="Li">44</span> and you want to
    stop at <span class="Li">&quot;a&quot;</span>. Simply matching pairs of
    digits skips over the <span class="Li">&quot;a&quot;</span> and still
    matches <span class="Li">44</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    $_ = &quot;1122a44&quot;;
    my @pairs = m/(\d\d)/g;   # qw( 11 22 44 )
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If you use the <span class="Li">&quot;\G&quot;</span> anchor, you
    force the match after <span class="Li">22</span> to start with the
    <span class="Li">&quot;a&quot;</span>. The regular expression cannot match
    there since it does not find a digit, so the next match fails and the match
    operator returns the pairs it already found.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    $_ = &quot;1122a44&quot;;
    my @pairs = m/\G(\d\d)/g; # qw( 11 22 )
</pre>
<p class="Pp">You can also use the <span class="Li">&quot;\G&quot;</span> anchor
    in scalar context. You still need the <span class="Li">&quot;g&quot;</span>
    flag.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    $_ = &quot;1122a44&quot;;
    while( m/\G(\d\d)/g ) {
        print &quot;Found $1\n&quot;;
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">After the match fails at the letter
    <span class="Li">&quot;a&quot;</span>, perl resets
    <span class="Li">&quot;pos()&quot;</span> and the next match on the same
    string starts at the beginning.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    $_ = &quot;1122a44&quot;;
    while( m/\G(\d\d)/g ) {
        print &quot;Found $1\n&quot;;
    }
    print &quot;Found $1 after while&quot; if m/(\d\d)/g; # finds &quot;11&quot;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">You can disable <span class="Li">&quot;pos()&quot;</span> resets
    on fail with the <span class="Li">&quot;c&quot;</span> flag, documented in
    perlop and perlreref. Subsequent matches start where the last successful
    match ended (the value of <span class="Li">&quot;pos()&quot;</span>) even if
    a match on the same string has failed in the meantime. In this case, the
    match after the <span class="Li">&quot;while()&quot;</span> loop starts at
    the <span class="Li">&quot;a&quot;</span> (where the last match stopped),
    and since it does not use any anchor it can skip over the
    <span class="Li">&quot;a&quot;</span> to find
  <span class="Li">44</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    $_ = &quot;1122a44&quot;;
    while( m/\G(\d\d)/gc ) {
        print &quot;Found $1\n&quot;;
    }
    print &quot;Found $1 after while&quot; if m/(\d\d)/g; # finds &quot;44&quot;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Typically you use the <span class="Li">&quot;\G&quot;</span>
    anchor with the <span class="Li">&quot;c&quot;</span> flag when you want to
    try a different match if one fails, such as in a tokenizer. Jeffrey Friedl
    offers this example which works in 5.004 or later.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    while (&lt;&gt;) {
        chomp;
        PARSER: {
            m/ \G( \d+\b    )/gcx   &amp;&amp; do { print &quot;number: $1\n&quot;;  redo; };
            m/ \G( \w+      )/gcx   &amp;&amp; do { print &quot;word:   $1\n&quot;;  redo; };
            m/ \G( \s+      )/gcx   &amp;&amp; do { print &quot;space:  $1\n&quot;;  redo; };
            m/ \G( [^\w\d]+ )/gcx   &amp;&amp; do { print &quot;other:  $1\n&quot;;  redo; };
        }
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">For each line, the <span class="Li">&quot;PARSER&quot;</span> loop
    first tries to match a series of digits followed by a word boundary. This
    match has to start at the place the last match left off (or the beginning of
    the string on the first match). Since <span class="Li">&quot;m/ \G(
    \d+\b</span> <span class="Li">)/gcx&quot;</span> uses the
    <span class="Li">&quot;c&quot;</span> flag, if the string does not match
    that regular expression, perl does not reset <i>pos()</i> and the next match
    starts at the same position to try a different pattern.</p>

  Perl regexes DFAs or NFAs? Are they POSIX compliant?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">While it's true that Perl's regular expressions resemble the DFAs
    (deterministic finite automata) of the <i>egrep</i>(1) program, they are in
    fact implemented as NFAs (non-deterministic finite automata) to allow
    backtracking and backreferencing. And they aren't POSIX-style either,
    because those guarantee worst-case behavior for all cases. (It seems that
    some people prefer guarantees of consistency, even when what's guaranteed is
    slowness.) See the book &quot;Mastering Regular Expressions&quot; (from
    O'Reilly) by Jeffrey Friedl for all the details you could ever hope to know
    on these matters (a full citation appears in perlfaq2).</p>

  wrong with using grep in a void context?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The problem is that grep builds a return list, regardless of the
    context. This means you're making Perl go to the trouble of building a list
    that you then just throw away. If the list is large, you waste both time and
    space. If your intent is to iterate over the list, then use a for loop for
    this purpose.</p>
<p class="Pp">In perls older than 5.8.1, map suffers from this problem as well.
    But since 5.8.1, this has been fixed, and map is context aware - in void
    context, no lists are constructed.</p>

  can I match strings with multibyte characters?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Starting from Perl 5.6 Perl has had some level of multibyte
    character support. Perl 5.8 or later is recommended. Supported multibyte
    character repertoires include Unicode, and legacy encodings through the
    Encode module. See perluniintro, perlunicode, and Encode.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you are stuck with older Perls, you can do Unicode with the
    Unicode::String module, and character conversions using the Unicode::Map8
    and Unicode::Map modules. If you are using Japanese encodings, you might try
    using the jperl 5.005_03.</p>
<p class="Pp">Finally, the following set of approaches was offered by Jeffrey
    Friedl, whose article in issue #5 of The Perl Journal talks about this very
    matter.</p>
<p class="Pp">Let's suppose you have some weird Martian encoding where pairs of
    ASCII uppercase letters encode single Martian letters (i.e. the two bytes
    &quot;CV&quot; make a single Martian letter, as do the two bytes
    &quot;SG&quot;, &quot;VS&quot;, &quot;XX&quot;, etc.). Other bytes represent
    single characters, just like ASCII.</p>
<p class="Pp">So, the string of Martian &quot;I am CVSGXX!&quot; uses 12 bytes
    to encode the nine characters 'I', ' ', 'a', 'm', ' ', 'CV', 'SG', 'XX',
    '!'.</p>
<p class="Pp">Now, say you want to search for the single character
    <span class="Li">&quot;/GX/&quot;</span>. Perl doesn't know about Martian,
    so it'll find the two bytes &quot;GX&quot; in the &quot;I am CVSGXX!&quot;
    string, even though that character isn't there: it just looks like it is
    because &quot;SG&quot; is next to &quot;XX&quot;, but there's no real
    &quot;GX&quot;. This is a big problem.</p>
<p class="Pp">Here are a few ways, all painful, to deal with it:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    # Make sure adjacent &quot;martian&quot; bytes are no longer adjacent.
    $martian =~ s/([A-Z][A-Z])/ $1 /g;
    print &quot;found GX!\n&quot; if $martian =~ /GX/;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Or like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    my @chars = $martian =~ m/([A-Z][A-Z]|[^A-Z])/g;
    # above is conceptually similar to:     my @chars = $text =~ m/(.)/g;
    #
    foreach my $char (@chars) {
        print &quot;found GX!\n&quot;, last if $char eq 'GX';
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Or like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    while ($martian =~ m/\G([A-Z][A-Z]|.)/gs) {  # \G probably unneeded
        if ($1 eq 'GX') {
            print &quot;found GX!\n&quot;;
            last;
        }
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Here's another, slightly less painful, way to do it from Benjamin
    Goldberg, who uses a zero-width negative look-behind assertion.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    print &quot;found GX!\n&quot; if    $martian =~ m/
        (?&lt;![A-Z])
        (?:[A-Z][A-Z])*?
        GX
        /x;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This succeeds if the &quot;martian&quot; character GX is in the
    string, and fails otherwise. If you don't like using (?&lt;!), a zero-width
    negative look-behind assertion, you can replace (?&lt;![A-Z]) with
    (?:^|[^A-Z]).</p>
<p class="Pp">It does have the drawback of putting the wrong thing in $-[0] and
    $+[0], but this usually can be worked around.</p>

  do I match a regular expression that's in a variable?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">(contributed by brian d foy)</p>
<p class="Pp">We don't have to hard-code patterns into the match operator (or
    anything else that works with regular expressions). We can put the pattern
    in a variable for later use.</p>
<p class="Pp">The match operator is a double quote context, so you can
    interpolate your variable just like a double quoted string. In this case,
    you read the regular expression as user input and store it in
    <span class="Li">$regex</span>. Once you have the pattern in
    <span class="Li">$regex</span>, you use that variable in the match
  operator.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    chomp( my $regex = &lt;STDIN&gt; );
    if( $string =~ m/$regex/ ) { ... }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Any regular expression special characters in
    <span class="Li">$regex</span> are still special, and the pattern still has
    to be valid or Perl will complain. For instance, in this pattern there is an
    unpaired parenthesis.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    my $regex = &quot;Unmatched ( paren&quot;;
    &quot;Two parens to bind them all&quot; =~ m/$regex/;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">When Perl compiles the regular expression, it treats the
    parenthesis as the start of a memory match. When it doesn't find the closing
    parenthesis, it complains:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    Unmatched ( in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/Unmatched ( &lt;-- HERE  paren/ at script line 3.
</pre>
<p class="Pp">You can get around this in several ways depending on our
    situation. First, if you don't want any of the characters in the string to
    be special, you can escape them with
    <span class="Li">&quot;quotemeta&quot;</span> before you use the string.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    chomp( my $regex = &lt;STDIN&gt; );
    $regex = quotemeta( $regex );
    if( $string =~ m/$regex/ ) { ... }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">You can also do this directly in the match operator using the
    <span class="Li">&quot;\Q&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;\E&quot;</span> sequences. The
    <span class="Li">&quot;\Q&quot;</span> tells Perl where to start escaping
    special characters, and the <span class="Li">&quot;\E&quot;</span> tells it
    where to stop (see perlop for more details).</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    chomp( my $regex = &lt;STDIN&gt; );
    if( $string =~ m/\Q$regex\E/ ) { ... }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Alternately, you can use <span class="Li">&quot;qr//&quot;</span>,
    the regular expression quote operator (see perlop for more details). It
    quotes and perhaps compiles the pattern, and you can apply regular
    expression flags to the pattern.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    chomp( my $input = &lt;STDIN&gt; );
    my $regex = qr/$input/is;
    $string =~ m/$regex/  # same as m/$input/is;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">You might also want to trap any errors by wrapping an
    <span class="Li">&quot;eval&quot;</span> block around the whole thing.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    chomp( my $input = &lt;STDIN&gt; );
    eval {
        if( $string =~ m/\Q$input\E/ ) { ... }
    };
    warn $@ if $@;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Or...</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    my $regex = eval { qr/$input/is };
    if( defined $regex ) {
        $string =~ m/$regex/;
    }
    else {
        warn $@;
    }
