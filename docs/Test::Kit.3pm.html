   Set up some character translations and predefined strings.  \*(-- will
   give an unbreakable dash, \*(PI will give pi, \*(L" will give a left
   double quote, and \*(R" will give a right double quote.  \*(C+ will
   give a nicer C++.  Capital omega is used to do unbreakable dashes and
   therefore won't be available.  \*(C` and \*(C' expand to `' in nroff,
   nothing in troff, for use with C<>.

Test::Kit - Build custom test packages with only the features you want
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
Test::Kit allows you to create a single module in your project which gives you
  access to all of the testing functions you want.
<p class="Pp">Its primary goal is to reduce boilerplate code that is currently
    littering the top of all your test files.</p>
<p class="Pp">It also allows your testing to be more consistent; for example it
    becomes a trivial change to include Test::FailWarnings in all of your tests,
    and there is no danger that you forget to include it in a new test.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="VERSION"><a class="permalink" href="#VERSION">VERSION</a></h1>
Test::Kit 2.0 is a complete rewrite of Test::Kit by a new author.
<p class="Pp">It serves much the same purpose as the original Test::Kit, but
    comes with a completely new interface and some serious bugs ironed out.</p>
<p class="Pp">The 'features' such as '+explain' and '+on_fail' have been
    removed. If you were using these please contact me via rt.cpan.org.</p>

This means that Test::Kit was unable to determine which module <b>include()</b>
  was called from. It probably means you're doing something weird!
<p class="Pp">If this is happening under any normal circumstances please file a
    bug report!</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Subroutine__s()_already_supplied_to__s_by__s"><a class="permalink" href="#Subroutine__s()_already_supplied_to__s_by__s">Subroutine
  %s() already supplied to %s by %s</a></h2>
This happens when there is a subroutine name collision. For example if you try
  to include both Test::Simple and Test::More in your Kit it will complain that
  <b>ok()</b> has been defined twice.
<p class="Pp">You should be able to use the exclude or rename options to solve
    these collisions.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Package__s_already_has_an__fBimport()_fP_sub"><a class="permalink" href="#Package__s_already_has_an__fBimport()_fP_sub">Package
  %s already has an <b>import()</b> sub</a></h2>
This happens when your module has an import subroutine before the first
  <b>include()</b> call. This could be because you have defined one, or because
  your module has inherited an <b>import()</b> subroutine through an ISA
  relationship.
<p class="Pp">Test::Kit intends to install its own import method into your
    module, specifically it is going to install Test::Builder::Module's
    <b>import()</b> method. Test::Builder::Module is an Exporter, so if you want
    to define your own subroutines and export those you can push onto
    <span class="Li">@EXPORT</span> after all the calls to <b>include()</b>.</p>

Test::Kit 2.15 and above should work with Test-Simple 1.0 and 1.3 releases. Huge
  thanks to Chad Granum and Karen Etheridge for all their help with 1.3 support.
  I highly recommend upgrading to Test-Simple 1.3.

A couple of other modules try to generalize this problem beyond the scope of
  testing:
<p class="Pp">ToolSet - Load your commonly-used modules in a single import</p>
<p class="Pp">Import::Base - Import a set of modules into the calling module</p>
<p class="Pp">Test::Kit largely differs from these in that it always makes your
    module behave like Test::More.</p>
