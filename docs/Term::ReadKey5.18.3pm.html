<p class="Pp">Term::ReadKey is a compiled perl module dedicated to providing
    simple control over terminal driver modes (cbreak, raw, cooked, etc.,)
    support for non-blocking reads, if the architecture allows, and some
    generalized handy functions for working with terminals. One of the main
    goals is to have the functions as portable as possible, so you can just plug
    in &quot;use Term::ReadKey&quot; on any architecture and have a good
    likelihood of it working.</p>
<p class="Pp">Version 2.30.01: Added handling of arrows, page up/down, home/end,
    insert/delete keys under Win32. These keys emit xterm-compatible sequences.
    Works with Term::ReadLine::Perl.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="ReadMode"><a class="permalink" href="#ReadMode">ReadMode MODE [,
    Filehandle]</a></dt>
  <dd>Takes an integer argument or a string synonym (case insensitive), which
      can currently be one of the following values:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    INT   SYNONYM    DESCRIPTION
    0    'restore'   Restore original settings.
    1    'normal'    Change to what is commonly the default mode,
                     echo on, buffered, signals enabled, Xon/Xoff
                     possibly enabled, and 8-bit mode possibly disabled.
    2    'noecho'    Same as 1, just with echo off. Nice for
                     reading passwords.
    3    'cbreak'    Echo off, unbuffered, signals enabled, Xon/Xoff
                     possibly enabled, and 8-bit mode possibly enabled.
    4    'raw'       Echo off, unbuffered, signals disabled, Xon/Xoff
                     disabled, and 8-bit mode possibly disabled.
    5    'ultra-raw' Echo off, unbuffered, signals disabled, Xon/Xoff 
                     disabled, 8-bit mode enabled if parity permits,
                     and CR to CR/LF translation turned off.
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">These functions are automatically applied to the STDIN handle
        if no other handle is supplied. Modes 0 and 5 have some special
        properties worth mentioning: not only will mode 0 restore original
        settings, but it cause the next ReadMode call to save a new set of
        default settings. Mode 5 is similar to mode 4, except no CR/LF
        translation is performed, and if possible, parity will be disabled (only
        if not being used by the terminal, however. It is no different from mode
        4 under Windows.)</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you just need to read a key at a time, then modes 3 or 4
        are probably sufficient. Mode 4 is a tad more flexible, but needs a bit
        more work to control. If you use ReadMode 3, then you should install a
        SIGINT or END handler to reset the terminal (via ReadMode 0) if the user
        aborts the program via <span class="Li">&quot;^C&quot;</span>. (For any
        mode, an END handler consisting of &quot;ReadMode 0&quot; is actually a
        good idea.)</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you are executing another program that may be changing the
        terminal mode, you will either want to say</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    ReadMode 1;             # same as ReadMode 'normal'
    system('someprogram');
    ReadMode 1;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">which resets the settings after the program has run, or:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    $somemode=1;
    ReadMode 0;             # same as ReadMode 'restore'
    system('someprogram');
    ReadMode 1;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">which records any changes the program may have made, before
        resetting the mode.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="ReadKey"><a class="permalink" href="#ReadKey">ReadKey MODE [,
    Filehandle]</a></dt>
  <dd>Takes an integer argument, which can currently be one of the following
      values:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    0    Perform a normal read using getc
    -1   Perform a non-blocked read
    &gt;0   Perform a timed read
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If the filehandle is not supplied, it will default to STDIN.
        If there is nothing waiting in the buffer during a non-blocked read,
        then undef will be returned. In most situations, you will probably want
        to use <span class="Li">&quot;ReadKey -1&quot;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><i>NOTE</i> that if the OS does not provide any known
        mechanism for non-blocking reads, then a <span class="Li">&quot;ReadKey
        -1&quot;</span> can die with a fatal error. This will hopefully not be
        common.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If MODE is greater then zero, then ReadKey will use it as a
        timeout value in seconds (fractional seconds are allowed), and won't
        return <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> until that time
        expires.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><i>NOTE</i>, again, that some OS's may not support this
        timeout behaviour.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If MODE is less then zero, then this is treated as a timeout
        of zero, and thus will return immediately if no character is waiting. A
        MODE of zero, however, will act like a normal getc.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><i>NOTE</i>, there are currently some limitations with this
        call under Windows. It may be possible that non-blocking reads will fail
        when reading repeating keys from more then one console.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="ReadLine"><a class="permalink" href="#ReadLine">ReadLine MODE [,
    Filehandle]</a></dt>
  <dd>Takes an integer argument, which can currently be one of the following
      values:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    0    Perform a normal read using scalar(&lt;FileHandle&gt;)
    -1   Perform a non-blocked read
    &gt;0   Perform a timed read
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If there is nothing waiting in the buffer during a non-blocked
        read, then undef will be returned.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><i>NOTE</i>, that if the OS does not provide any known
        mechanism for non-blocking reads, then a <span class="Li">&quot;ReadLine
        1&quot;</span> can die with a fatal error. This will hopefully not be
        common.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><i>NOTE</i> that a non-blocking test is only performed for the
        first character in the line, not the entire line. This call will
        probably <b>not</b> do what you assume, especially with
        <span class="Li">&quot;ReadMode&quot;</span> MODE values higher then 1.
        For example, pressing Space and then Backspace would appear to leave you
        where you started, but any timeouts would now be suspended.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><b>This call is currently not available under Windows</b>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="GetTerminalSize"><a class="permalink" href="#GetTerminalSize">GetTerminalSize
    [Filehandle]</a></dt>
  <dd>Returns either an empty array if this operation is unsupported, or a four
      element array containing: the width of the terminal in characters, the
      height of the terminal in character, the width in pixels, and the height
      in pixels. (The pixel size will only be valid in some environments.)
    <p class="Pp"><i>NOTE</i>, under Windows, this function must be called with
        an <b>output</b> filehandle, such as
        <span class="Li">&quot;STDOUT&quot;</span>, or a handle opened to
        <span class="Li">&quot;CONOUT$&quot;</span>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="SetTerminalSize"><a class="permalink" href="#SetTerminalSize">SetTerminalSize
    WIDTH,HEIGHT,XPIX,YPIX [, Filehandle]</a></dt>
  <dd>Return -1 on failure, 0 otherwise.
    <p class="Pp"><i>NOTE</i> that this terminal size is only for
        <b>informative</b> value, and changing the size via this mechanism will
        <b>not</b> change the size of the screen. For example, XTerm uses a call
        like this when it resizes the screen. If any of the new measurements
        vary from the old, the OS will probably send a SIGWINCH signal to
        anything reading that tty or pty.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><b>This call does not work under Windows</b>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="GetSpeed"><a class="permalink" href="#GetSpeed">GetSpeed [,
    Filehandle]</a></dt>
  <dd>Returns either an empty array if the operation is unsupported, or a two
      value array containing the terminal in and out speeds, in <b>decimal</b>.
      E.g, an in speed of 9600 baud and an out speed of 4800 baud would be
      returned as (9600,4800). Note that currently the in and out speeds will
      always be identical in some OS's.
    <p class="Pp"><b>No speeds are reported under Windows</b>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="GetControlChars"><a class="permalink" href="#GetControlChars">GetControlChars
    [, Filehandle]</a></dt>
  <dd>Returns an array containing key/value pairs suitable for a hash. The pairs
      consist of a key, the name of the control character/signal, and the value
      of that character, as a single character.
    <p class="Pp"><b>This call does nothing under Windows</b>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Each key will be an entry from the following list:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>        DISCARD
        DSUSPEND
        EOF
        EOL
        EOL2
        ERASE
        ERASEWORD
        INTERRUPT
        KILL
        MIN
        QUIT
        QUOTENEXT
        REPRINT
        START
        STATUS
        STOP
        SUSPEND
        SWITCH
        TIME
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Thus, the following will always return the current interrupt
        character, regardless of platform.</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>        %keys = GetControlChars;
        $int = $keys{INTERRUPT};
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt id="SetControlChars"><a class="permalink" href="#SetControlChars">SetControlChars
    [, Filehandle]</a></dt>
  <dd>Takes an array containing key/value pairs, as a hash will produce. The
      pairs should consist of a key that is the name of a legal control
      character/signal, and the value should be either a single character, or a
      number in the range 0-255. SetControlChars will die with a runtime error
      if an invalid character name is passed or there is an error changing the
      settings. The list of valid names is easily available via
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>        %cchars = GetControlChars();
        @cnames = keys %cchars;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp"><b>This call does nothing under Windows</b>.</p>
