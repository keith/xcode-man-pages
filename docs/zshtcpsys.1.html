zshtcpsys - zsh tcp system

<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
A module <b>zsh/net/tcp</b> is provided to provide network I/O over TCP/IP from
  within the shell; see its description in <i>zshmodules</i>(1). This manual
  page describes a function suite based on the module. If the module is
  installed, the functions are usually installed at the same time, in which case
  they will be available for autoloading in the default function search path. In
  addition to the <b>zsh/net/tcp</b> module, the <b>zsh/zselect</b> module is
  used to implement timeouts on read operations. For troubleshooting tips,
  consult the corresponding advice for the <b>zftp</b> functions described in
  <i>zshzftpsys</i>(1).
<p class="Pp">There are functions corresponding to the basic I/O operations
    open, close, read and send, named <b>tcp_open</b> etc., as well as a
    function <b>tcp_expect</b> for pattern match analysis of data read as input.
    The system makes it easy to receive data from and send data to multiple
    named sessions at once. In addition, it can be linked with the shell's line
    editor in such a way that input data is automatically shown at the terminal.
    Other facilities available including logging, filtering and configurable
    output prompts.</p>
<p class="Pp">To use the system where it is available, it should be enough to
    `<b>autoload -U tcp_open</b>' and run <b>tcp_open</b> as documented below to
    start a session. The <b>tcp_open</b> function will autoload the remaining
    functions.</p>

  <dd></dd>

  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>tcp_open</b> [ <b>-qz</b> ] [ <b>-a</b> <i>fd</i> | <b>-f</b> <i>fd</i>
    ] [ <i>sess</i> ]</dt>
  <dd>Open a new session. In the first and simplest form, open a TCP connection
      to host <i>host</i> at port <i>port</i>; numeric and symbolic forms are
      understood for both.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">If <i>sess</i> is given, this becomes the name of the session
    which can be used to refer to multiple different TCP connections. If
    <i>sess</i> is not given, the function will invent a numeric name value
    (note this is <i>not</i> the same as the file descriptor to which the
    session is attached). It is recommended that session names not include
    `funny' characters, where funny characters are not well-defined but
    certainly do not include alphanumerics or underscores, and certainly do
    include whitespace.</p>
<p class="Pp">In the second case, one or more sessions to be opened are given by
    name. A single session name is given after <b>-s</b> and a comma-separated
    list after <b>-l</b>; both options may be repeated as many times as
    necessary. A failure to open any session causes <b>tcp_open</b> to abort.
    The host and port are read from the file <b>.ztcp_sessions</b> in the same
    directory as the user's zsh initialisation files, i.e. usually the home
    directory, but <b>$ZDOTDIR</b> if that is set. The file consists of lines
    each giving a session name and the corresponding host and port, in that
    order (note the session name comes first, not last), separated by
    whitespace.</p>
<p class="Pp">The third form allows passive and fake TCP connections. If the
    option <b>-a</b> is used, its argument is a file descriptor open for
    listening for connections. No function front-end is provided to open such a
    file descriptor, but a call to `<b>ztcp -l</b> <i>port</i>' will create one
    with the file descriptor stored in the parameter <b>$REPLY</b>. The
    listening port can be closed with `<b>ztcp -c</b> <i>fd</i>'. A call to
    `<b>tcp_open -a</b> <i>fd</i>' will block until a remote TCP connection is
    made to <i>port</i> on the local machine. At this point, a session is
    created in the usual way and is largely indistinguishable from an active
    connection created with one of the first two forms.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the option <b>-f</b> is used, its argument is a file descriptor
    which is used directly as if it were a TCP session. How well the remainder
    of the TCP function system copes with this depends on what actually
    underlies this file descriptor. A regular file is likely to be unusable; a
    FIFO (pipe) of some sort will work better, but note that it is not a good
    idea for two different sessions to attempt to read from the same FIFO at
    once.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the option <b>-q</b> is given with any of the three forms,
    <b>tcp_open</b> will not print informational messages, although it will in
    any case exit with an appropriate status.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the line editor (zle) is in use, which is typically the case if
    the shell is interactive, <b>tcp_open</b> installs a handler inside zle
    which will check for new data at the same time as it checks for keyboard
    input. This is convenient as the shell consumes no CPU time while waiting;
    the test is performed by the operating system. Giving the option <b>-z</b>
    to any of the forms of <b>tcp_open</b> prevents the handler from being
    installed, so data must be read explicitly. Note, however, this is not
    necessary for executing complete sets of send and read commands from a
    function, as zle is not active at this point. Generally speaking, the
    handler is only active when the shell is waiting for input at a command
    prompt or in the <b>vared</b> builtin. The option has no effect if zle is
    not active; `<b>[[ -o zle]]</b>' will test for this.</p>
<p class="Pp">The first session to be opened becomes the current session and
    subsequent calls to <b>tcp_open</b> do not change it. The current session is
    stored in the parameter <b>$TCP_SESS</b>; see below for more detail about
    the parameters used by the system.</p>
<p class="Pp">The function <b>tcp_on_open</b>, if defined, is called when a
    session is opened. See the description below.</p>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>tcp_close</b> [ <b>-qn</b> ] [ <b>-a</b> | <b>-l</b>
    <i>sess</i>[<b>,</b>...] | <i>sess</i> ... ]</dt>
  <dd>Close the named sessions, or the current session if none is given, or all
      open sessions if <b>-a</b> is given. The options <b>-l</b> and <b>-s</b>
      are both handled for consistency with <b>tcp_open</b>, although the latter
      is redundant.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">If the session being closed is the current one, <b>$TCP_SESS</b>
    is unset, leaving no current session, even if there are other sessions still
    open.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the session was opened with <b>tcp_open -f</b>, the file
    descriptor is closed so long as it is in the range 0 to 9 accessible
    directly from the command line. If the option <b>-n</b> is given, no attempt
    will be made to close file descriptors in this case. The <b>-n</b> option is
    not used for genuine <b>ztcp</b> session; the file descriptors are always
    closed with the session.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the option <b>-q</b> is given, no informational messages will
    be printed.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>tcp_read </b>[ <b>-bdq</b> ] [ <b>-t</b> <i>TO</i> ] [ <b>-T</b>
    <i>TO</i> ]</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b> </b>[ <b>-a</b> | <b>-u</b> <i>fd</i>[<b>,</b>...] | <b>-l</b>
    <i>sess</i>[<b>,</b>...] | <b>-s</b> <i>sess</i> ... ]</dt>
  <dd>Perform a read operation on the current session, or on a list of sessions
      if any are given with <b>-u</b>, <b>-l</b> or <b>-s</b>, or all open
      sessions if the option <b>-a</b> is given. Any of the <b>-u</b>, <b>-l</b>
      or <b>-s</b> options may be repeated or mixed together. The <b>-u</b>
      option specifies a file descriptor directly (only those managed by this
      system are useful), the other two specify sessions as described for
      <b>tcp_open</b> above.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">The function checks for new data available on all the sessions
    listed. Unless the <b>-b</b> option is given, it will not block waiting for
    new data. Any one line of data from any of the available sessions will be
    read, stored in the parameter <b>$TCP_LINE</b>, and displayed to standard
    output unless <b>$TCP_SILENT</b> contains a non-empty string. When printed
    to standard output the string <b>$TCP_PROMPT</b> will be shown at the start
    of the line; the default form for this includes the name of the session
    being read. See below for more information on these parameters. In this
    mode, <b>tcp_read</b> can be called repeatedly until it returns status 2
    which indicates all pending input from all specified sessions has been
    handled.</p>
<p class="Pp">With the option <b>-b</b>, equivalent to an infinite timeout, the
    function will block until a line is available to read from one of the
    specified sessions. However, only a single line is returned.</p>
<p class="Pp">The option <b>-d</b> indicates that all pending input should be
    drained. In this case <b>tcp_read</b> may process multiple lines in the
    manner given above; only the last is stored in <b>$TCP_LINE</b>, but the
    complete set is stored in the array <b>$tcp_lines</b>. This is cleared at
    the start of each call to <b>tcp_read</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The options <b>-t</b> and <b>-T</b> specify a timeout in seconds,
    which may be a floating point number for increased accuracy. With <b>-t</b>
    the timeout is applied before each line read. With <b>-T</b>, the timeout
    applies to the overall operation, possibly including multiple read
    operations if the option <b>-d</b> is present; without this option, there is
    no distinction between <b>-t</b> and <b>-T</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The function does not print informational messages, but if the
    option <b>-q</b> is given, no error message is printed for a non-existent
    session.</p>
<p class="Pp">A return status of 2 indicates a timeout or no data to read. Any
    other non-zero return status indicates some error condition.</p>
<p class="Pp">See <b>tcp_log</b> for how to control where data is sent by
    <b>tcp_read</b>.</p>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>tcp_send</b> [ <b>-cnq</b> ] [ <b>-s</b> <i>sess</i> | <b>-l</b>
    <i>sess</i>[<b>,</b>...] ] <i>data</i> ...</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>tcp_send</b> [ <b>-cnq</b> ] <b>-a</b> <i>data</i> ...</dt>
  <dd>Send the supplied data strings to all the specified sessions in turn. The
      underlying operation differs little from a `<b>print -r</b>' to the
      session's file descriptor, although it attempts to prevent the shell from
      dying owing to a <b>SIGPIPE</b> caused by an attempt to write to a defunct
      session.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">The option <b>-c</b> causes <b>tcp_send</b> to behave like
    <b>cat</b>. It reads lines from standard input until end of input and sends
    them in turn to the specified session(s) exactly as if they were given as
    <i>data</i> arguments to individual <b>tcp_send</b> commands.</p>
<p class="Pp">The option <b>-n</b> prevents <b>tcp_send</b> from putting a
    newline at the end of the data strings.</p>
<p class="Pp">The remaining options all behave as for <b>tcp_read</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The data arguments are not further processed once they have been
    passed to <b>tcp_send</b>; they are simply passed down to <b>print
  -r</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the parameter <b>$TCP_OUTPUT</b> is a non-empty string and
    logging is enabled then the data sent to each session will be echoed to the
    log file(s) with <b>$TCP_OUTPUT</b> in front where appropriate, much in the
    manner of <b>$TCP_PROMPT</b>.</p>

      the call to <b>tcp_expect</b> is stored in the array
      <b>$tcp_expect_lines</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">Sessions are specified in the same way as <b>tcp_read</b>: the
    default is to use the current session, otherwise the sessions specified by
    <b>-a</b>, <b>-s</b>, or <b>-l</b> are used.</p>
<p class="Pp">Each <i>pattern</i> is a standard zsh extended-globbing pattern;
    note that it needs to be quoted to avoid it being expanded immediately by
    filename generation. It must match the full line, so to match a substring
    there must be a `<b>*</b>' at the start and end. The line matched against
    includes the <b>$TCP_PROMPT</b> added by <b>tcp_read</b>. It is possible to
    include the globbing flags `<b>#b</b>' or `<b>#m</b>' in the patterns to
    make backreferences available in the parameters <b>$MATCH</b>,
    <b>$match</b>, etc., as described in the base zsh documentation on pattern
    matching.</p>
<p class="Pp">Unlike <b>tcp_read</b>, the default behaviour of <b>tcp_expect</b>
    is to block indefinitely until the required input is found. This can be
    modified by specifying a timeout with <b>-t</b> or <b>-T</b>; these function
    as in <b>tcp_read</b>, specifying a per-read or overall timeout,
    respectively, in seconds, as an integer or floating-point number. As
    <b>tcp_read</b>, the function returns status 2 if a timeout occurs.</p>
<p class="Pp">The function returns as soon as any one of the patterns given
    match. If the caller needs to know which of the patterns matched, the option
    <b>-p</b> <i>var</i> can be used; on return, <b>$var</b> is set to the
    number of the pattern using ordinary zsh indexing, i.e. the first is 1, and
    so on. Note the absence of a `<b>$</b>' in front of <i>var</i>. To avoid
    clashes, the parameter cannot begin with `<b>_expect</b>'. The index -1 is
    used if there is a timeout and 0 if there is no match.</p>
<p class="Pp">The option <b>-P</b> <i>var</i> works similarly to <b>-p</b>, but
    instead of numerical indexes the regular arguments must begin with a prefix
    followed by a colon: that prefix is then used as a tag to which <i>var</i>
    is set when the argument matches. The tag <b>timeout</b> is used if there is
    a timeout and the empty string if there is no match. Note it is acceptable
    for different arguments to start with the same prefix if the matches do not
    need to be distinguished.</p>
<p class="Pp">The option <b>-q</b> is passed directly down to
  <b>tcp_read</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">As all input is done via <b>tcp_read</b>, all the usual rules
    about output of lines read apply. One exception is that the parameter
    <b>$tcp_lines</b> will only reflect the line actually matched by
    <b>tcp_expect</b>; use <b>$tcp_expect_lines</b> for the full set of lines
    read during the function call.</p>

    direct access to your account, which in many cases will be a bad thing.</p>

    otherwise all sessions are taken. Second, any sessions given in the array
    <b>$tcp_no_spam_list</b> are removed from the list of sessions.</p>
<p class="Pp">Normally, any sessions added by the `<b>-a</b>' flag or when all

<p class="Pp">The current implementation is somewhat deficient in terms of use

  USER-DEFINED FUNCTIONS</a></h1>
Certain functions, if defined by the user, will be called by the function system
  in certain contexts. This facility depends on the module <b>zsh/parameter</b>,
  which is usually available in interactive shells as the completion system
  depends on it. None of the functions need be defined; they simply provide
  convenient hooks when necessary.
<p class="Pp">Typically, these are called after the requested action has been
    taken, so that the various parameters will reflect the new state.</p>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>tcp_on_alias</b> <i>alias</i> <i>fd</i></dt>

      the name of the alias, and the file descriptor of the corresponding
      session.</dd>
  <dt><b>tcp_on_awol</b> <i>sess</i> <i>fd</i></dt>
  <dd>If the function <b>tcp_fd_handler</b> is handling input from the line
      editor and detects that the file descriptor is no longer reusable, by
      default it removes it from the list of file descriptors handled by this
      method and prints a message. If the function <b>tcp_on_awol</b> is defined
      it is called immediately before this point. It may return status 100,
      which indicates that the normal handling should still be performed; any
      other return status indicates that no further action should be taken and
      the <b>tcp_fd_handler</b> should return immediately with the given status.
      Typically the action of <b>tcp_on_awol</b> will be to close the
    session.</dd>

  USER PARAMETERS</a></h1>
Parameters follow the usual convention that uppercase is used for scalars and
  integers, while lowercase is used for normal and associative array. It is
  always safe for user code to read these parameters. Some parameters may also
  be set; these are noted explicitly. Others are included in this group as they
  are set by the function system for the user's benefit, i.e. setting them is
  typically not useful but is benign.
<p class="Pp">It is often also useful to make settable parameters local to a
    function. For example, `<b>local TCP_SILENT=1</b>' specifies that data read
    during the function call will not be printed to standard output, regardless
    of the setting outside the function. Likewise, `<b>local
    TCP_SESS=</b><i>sess</i>' sets a session for the duration of a function, and
    `<b>local</b> <b>TCP_PROMPT=</b>' specifies that no prompt is used for input
    during the function.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>tcp_expect_lines</b></dt>
  <dd>Array. The set of lines read during the last call to <b>tcp_expect</b>,
      including the last (<b>$TCP_LINE</b>).</dd>
  <dt><b>tcp_filter</b></dt>
  <dd>Array. May be set directly. A set of extended globbing patterns which, if
      matched in <b>tcp_output</b>, will cause the line not to be printed to
      standard output. The patterns should be defined as described for the
      arguments to <b>tcp_expect</b>. Output of line to log files is not
      affected.</dd>
  <dt><b>TCP_HANDLER_ACTIVE</b></dt>
  <dd>Scalar. Set to 1 within <b>tcp_fd_handler</b> to indicate to functions
      called recursively that they have been called during an editor session.

  <dd>Array. May be set directly. See <b>tcp_spam</b> for how this is used.</dd>
  <dt><b>TCP_OUTPUT</b></dt>
  <dd>May be set directly. If a non-empty string, any data sent to a session by
      <b>tcp_send</b> will be logged. This parameter gives the prompt to be used
      in a file specified by <b>$TCP_LOG</b> but not in a file generated from
      <b>$TCP_LOG_SESS</b>. The prompt string has the same format as
      <b>TCP_PROMPT</b> and the same rules for its use apply.</dd>
  <dt><b>TCP_PROMPT</b></dt>
  <dd>May be set directly. Used as the prefix for data read by <b>tcp_read</b>
      which is printed to standard output or to the log file given by
      <b>$TCP_LOG</b>, if any. Any `<b>%s</b>', `<b>%f</b>' or `<b>%%</b>'
      occurring in the string will be replaced by the name of the session, the
      session's underlying file descriptor, or a single `<b>%</b>',
      respectively. The expression `<b>%c</b>' expands to 1 if the session being
      read is the current session, else 0; this is most useful in ternary

<p class="Pp"></p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>tcp_on_read</b></dt>
  <dd>This should be an associative array; if it is not, the behaviour is

      Every line read from a TCP session directly or indirectly using
      <b>tcp_read</b> (which includes lines read by <b>tcp_expect</b>) is
      compared against the pattern. If the line matches, the command given in

<p class="Pp">If any function called to handle a line returns a non-zero status,

The function <b>tcp_read</b> uses the shell's normal <b>read</b> builtin. As
