This document describes the personal philosophy behind the creation of
  <b>CPAN::MakeMaker</b> (the predecessor of <b>Module::Install</b>). The views

  HAVE A DREAM</a></h1>
I say to you today, my friends, that in spite of the difficulties and
  frustrations of the moment, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted
  in the Perl Module dream.
<p class="Pp">I have a dream that one day this community will rise up and live
    out the true meaning of its creed: &quot;We hold these truths to be
    self-evident: that all Perl authors are created equal.&quot;</p>
<p class="Pp">I have a dream that one day even the state of the
    <span class="Li">&quot;CGI::&quot;</span> namespace, a desert state,
    sweltering with the heat of injustice and oppression, will be transformed
    into an oasis of freedom and justice.</p>
<p class="Pp">I have a dream that my four modules will one day live in an
    archive where they will not be judged by the number of their prerequisites
    but by the content of their source code.</p>
<p class="Pp">I have a dream today.</p>

The above is obviously a mutation of the monumental speech by great Martin
  Luther King (&lt;http://web66.coled.umn.edu/new/MLK/MLK.html&gt;). While the
  contexts are vastly different, I feel that there are some serious
  parallelisms.
<p class="Pp">The CPAN has become a place that is not free of injustice. This
    situation has arisen not out of directed oppression, but from a failure of
    our community to keep its tools sharp. It is the culmination of many small
    decisions made in the name of practicality. This is a sad state for an
    institution that was created to allow all interested people to contribute
    equally to the best of their ability.</p>
<p class="Pp">This assertion is rooted in my personal experience as an author.
    When I created my first Perl module, Inline.pm, I knew that I had done
    something important. But how was I to make a dent in vast Perl
  community?</p>
<p class="Pp">As a complete unknown in the Perl community, my voice did not
    travel far. I repeatedly tried to get even an acknowledgment from the gurus
    familiar with XS. No success. I resorted to sending messages with ridiculous
    subjects to <span class="Li">&quot;modules@perl.org&quot;</span>.
    (&lt;http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/modules/2000-08/msg00078.html&gt;)
    No response. Through sheer determination and shameless self-promotion I
    eventually got the word out, and I hope the world is a slightly better place
    for it.</p>
<p class="Pp">Since then, Inline has won awards and I have had the privilege to
    meet almost all of Perl's finest. But I still remember the pain of starting
    out, and want to help invite more people into this wonderful world.</p>
<p class="Pp">One thing I have learned from experience is that the Perl
    community (and throw in the Python and Ruby people as well) is a small drop
    in the vast ocean of programming. It's a giant pot of Java out there; and a
    sea of C. Perl may not be the biggest fish, but with some care and cunning
    we could become a much bigger school.</p>
<p class="Pp">These are the current problems that I see with CPAN and the core
    modules:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>New Modules don't help Older Perls
    <p class="Pp">If I were to guess what percent of all Perl5 installations
        were at the current release level (5.8.0 in October 2002) I would say
        3-5%. That may even be generous. I'd say that over 40% of installations
        might still be at 5.005 or earlier.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The biggest problem with adding a module to the core is that
        it only helps a small subset of Perl users for a long long time. Worse
        yet, a good module author will still probably avoid using the core
        additions as prerequisites, because they want their new module to work
        as well on 5.005 as on 5.8.</p>
    <p class="Pp">CPAN::MakeMaker should be able to help in this regard. For
        example, instead of putting Inline.pm into the core for 5.9, I can now
        effectively get it into the core for every version of Perl that Inline
        supports.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Author Exclusiveness
    <p class="Pp">Not just anybody can get a module into the core. It seems you
        have to know people in high places. If I were a brilliant new talent
        with a great new module, it would have a harder time getting the ear of
        the pumpking, then if I were, say, Damian Conway. In fact, I probably
        wouldn't even know where to start.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Reduced Competition
    <p class="Pp">One comment I've heard from some very good Perl programmers is
        &quot;Everything important has already been done&quot;. Their feeling is
        that even though a module is suboptimal, it would be a waste of time to
        write a competing module. Who would use it instead of the one already in
        the core?</p>
    <p class="Pp">When I write a competing module, I know that I have to make it
        at least twice as good as the existing one to even get noticed. That's
        not a bad thing, but should everybody be forced into that situation?</p>
    <p class="Pp">For example, let's say that you have created a really useful
        CGI script. Let's also say that it makes use of your own
        <b>CGI::Special</b> module, because <b>CGI.pm</b> doesn't meet your
        needs. Even though your script might be generally useful and worth
        sharing, the fact that it requires a non-standard module can only
        negatively affect its acceptance. Trying to get general acceptance for
        the superior <b>CGI::Special</b> module will be harder still.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Core modules are assumed by the general public to be
        &quot;Best of Breed&quot;. While this may be true for some modules at
        some point in time, it keeps talented people from attempting to
        &quot;breed&quot; something better.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Core Bloat
    <p class="Pp">Every time we add a module to the core it gets bigger and
        bigger. And we can't ever remove modules from the core, once they've
        been added.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If I had my druthers, we'd remove all modules from the core
        that weren't necessary for either running Perl or installing modules. Of
        course, we'd need to set things up so that installing modules was so
        easy, that it could be done on the fly if necessary. Is this easily
        accomplishable? Nope. Is it impossible? Nope. We have the best language
        in the world to help us do it!</p>
  </li>
  <li>Maintenance Bitrot
    <p class="Pp">Believe it or not, Perl authors can sometimes acquire a
        &quot;Life Beyond Perl&quot;. They get families or new hobbies or even
        hit by a bus. (This would be a &quot;Death Beyond Perl&quot;.) The fact
        is, that once somebody writes a piece of code and shares it with the
        world, they are expected to maintain it for all time.</p>
    <p class="Pp">That is being generous. There are others that think that once
        their module has become popular or made it into the core, they don't
        need to keep fixing and improving it. I have personally been guilty of
        this sin.</p>
    <p class="Pp">And then there's the Damian Conway Effect. This plagues the
        exceptional authors who are so innovative and prolific they simply don't
        have time to maintain everything they have written.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">I initially formalized these opinions at the YAPC (Yet Another
    Perl Conference) in June 2001. Since then I have been trying to think of
    technological solutions to fix these social problems.</p>
<p class="Pp">One idea was dubbed NAPC. NAPC is CPAN backwards. It is a large
    system of precompiled modules that can be installed on the fly, with the
    goal of reducing the number of modules in the core. NAPC hasn't got started
    yet. I'd still like to do it someday, but it's a big problem with a lot of
    issues.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>CPAN::MakeMaker</b> (and now <b>Module::Install</b>) on the
    other hand, is simple and ultimately flexible. It should work with all of
    the existing CPAN processes without requiring any changes from them. And new
    features can be continuously added. Even though it doesn't scratch all of my
    philosophical CPAN itches, it's a good start.</p>
