<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
Net::SSLeay module contains perl bindings to openssl
  (&lt;http://www.openssl.org&gt;) library.
<p class="Pp"><b>COMPATIBILITY NOTE:</b> Net::SSLeay cannot be built with
    pre-0.9.3 openssl. It is strongly recommended to use at least 0.9.7 (as
    older versions are not tested during development). Some low level API
    functions may be available with certain openssl versions.</p>
<p class="Pp">It is compatible with OpenSSL 1.0 and 1.1. Some functions are not
    available under OpenSSL 1.1.</p>
<p class="Pp">Net::SSLeay module basically comprise of:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>High level functions for accessing web servers (by using HTTP/HTTPS)</li>
  <li>Low level API (mostly mapped 1:1 to openssl's C functions)</li>
  <li>Convenience functions (related to low level API but with more perl
      friendly interface)</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">There is also a related module called Net::SSLeay::Handle included
    in this distribution that you might want to use instead. It has its own pod
    documentation.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="High_level_functions_for_accessing_web_servers"><a class="permalink" href="#High_level_functions_for_accessing_web_servers">High
  level functions for accessing web servers</a></h2>
This module offers some high level convenience functions for accessing web pages
  on SSL servers (for symmetry, the same API is offered for accessing http
  servers, too), an <span class="Li">&quot;sslcat()&quot;</span> function for
  writing your own clients, and finally access to the SSL api of the
  SSLeay/OpenSSL package so you can write servers or clients for more
  complicated applications.
<p class="Pp">For high level functions it is most convenient to import them into
    your main namespace as indicated in the synopsis.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Basic set of functions</i></p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>get_https</li>
  <li>post_https</li>
  <li>put_https</li>
  <li>head_https</li>
  <li>do_https</li>
  <li>sslcat</li>
  <li>https_cat</li>
  <li>make_form</li>
  <li>make_headers</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp"><b>Case 1 (in SYNOPSIS)</b> demonstrates the typical invocation of
    <b>get_https()</b> to fetch an HTML page from secure server. The first
    argument provides the hostname or IP in dotted decimal notation of the
    remote server to contact. The second argument is the TCP port at the remote
    end (your own port is picked arbitrarily from high numbered ports as usual
    for TCP). The third argument is the URL of the page without the host name
    part. If in doubt consult the HTTP specifications at
    &lt;http://www.w3c.org&gt;.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Case 2 (in SYNOPSIS)</b> demonstrates full fledged use of
    <span class="Li">&quot;get_https()&quot;</span>. As can be seen,
    <span class="Li">&quot;get_https()&quot;</span> parses the response and
    response headers and returns them as a list, which can be captured in a hash
    for later reference. Also a fourth argument to
    <span class="Li">&quot;get_https()&quot;</span> is used to insert some
    additional headers in the request.
    <span class="Li">&quot;make_headers()&quot;</span> is a function that will
    convert a list or hash to such headers. By default
    <span class="Li">&quot;get_https()&quot;</span> supplies
    <span class="Li">&quot;Host&quot;</span> (to make virtual hosting easy) and
    <span class="Li">&quot;Accept&quot;</span> (reportedly needed by IIS)
    headers.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Case 2b (in SYNOPSIS)</b> demonstrates how to get a password
    protected page. Refer to the HTTP protocol specifications for further
    details (e.g. RFC-2617).</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Case 3 (in SYNOPSIS)</b> invokes
    <span class="Li">&quot;post_https()&quot;</span> to submit a HTML/CGI form
    to a secure server. The first four arguments are equal to
    <span class="Li">&quot;get_https()&quot;</span> (note that the empty string
    (<span class="Li">''</span>) is passed as header argument). The fifth
    argument is the contents of the form formatted according to CGI
    specification. Do not post UTF-8 data as content: use utf8::downgrade first.
    In this case the helper function
    <span class="Li">&quot;make_https()&quot;</span> is used to do the
    formatting, but you could pass any string.
    <span class="Li">&quot;post_https()&quot;</span> automatically adds
    <span class="Li">&quot;Content-Type&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;Content-Length&quot;</span> headers to the
  request.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Case 4 (in SYNOPSIS)</b> shows the fundamental
    <span class="Li">&quot;sslcat()&quot;</span> function (inspired in spirit by
    the <span class="Li">&quot;netcat&quot;</span> utility :-). It's your swiss
    army knife that allows you to easily contact servers, send some data, and
    then get the response. You are responsible for formatting the data and
    parsing the response - <span class="Li">&quot;sslcat()&quot;</span> is just
    a transport.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Case 5 (in SYNOPSIS)</b> is a full invocation of
    <span class="Li">&quot;sslcat()&quot;</span> which allows the return of
    errors as well as the server (peer) certificate.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">$trace</span> global variable can be used to
    control the verbosity of the high level functions. Level 0 guarantees
    silence, level 1 (the default) only emits error messages.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Alternate versions of high-level API</i></p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>get_https3</li>
  <li>post_https3</li>
  <li>put_https3</li>
  <li>get_https4</li>
  <li>post_https4</li>
  <li>put_https4</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">The above mentioned functions actually return the response headers
    as a list, which only gets converted to hash upon assignment (this
    assignment looses information if the same header occurs twice, as may be the
    case with cookies). There are also other variants of the functions that
    return unprocessed headers and that return a reference to a hash.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  ($page, $response, @headers) = get_https('www.bacus.pt', 443, '/');
  for ($i = 0; $i &lt; $#headers; $i+=2) {
      print &quot;$headers[$i] = &quot; . $headers[$i+1] . &quot;\n&quot;;
  }

  ($page, $response, $headers, $server_cert)
    = get_https3('www.bacus.pt', 443, '/');
  print &quot;$headers\n&quot;;

  ($page, $response, $headers_ref)
    = get_https4('www.bacus.pt', 443, '/');
  for $k (sort keys %{$headers_ref}) {
      for $v (@{$$headers_ref{$k}}) {
          print &quot;$k = $v\n&quot;;
      }
  }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">All of the above code fragments accomplish the same thing: display
    all values of all headers. The API functions ending in &quot;3&quot; return
    the headers simply as a scalar string and it is up to the application to
    split them up. The functions ending in &quot;4&quot; return a reference to a
    hash of arrays (see perlref and perllol if you are not familiar with complex
    perl data structures). To access a single value of such a header hash you
    would do something like</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  print $$headers_ref{COOKIE}[0];
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Variants 3 and 4 also allow you to discover the server certificate
    in case you would like to store or display it, e.g.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  ($p, $resp, $hdrs, $server_cert) = get_https3('www.bacus.pt', 443, '/');
  if (!defined($server_cert) || ($server_cert == 0)) {
      warn &quot;Subject Name: undefined, Issuer  Name: undefined&quot;;
  } else {
      warn 'Subject Name: '
          . Net::SSLeay::X509_NAME_oneline(
                 Net::SSLeay::X509_get_subject_name($server_cert))
              . 'Issuer  Name: '
                  . Net::SSLeay::X509_NAME_oneline(
                         Net::SSLeay::X509_get_issuer_name($server_cert));
  }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Beware that this method only allows after the fact verification of
    the certificate: by the time
    <span class="Li">&quot;get_https3()&quot;</span> has returned the https
    request has already been sent to the server, whether you decide to trust it
    or not. To do the verification correctly you must either employ the OpenSSL
    certificate verification framework or use the lower level API to first
    connect and verify the certificate and only then send the http data. See the
    implementation of <span class="Li">&quot;ds_https3()&quot;</span> for
    guidance on how to do this.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Using client certificates</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Secure web communications are encrypted using symmetric crypto
    keys exchanged using encryption based on the certificate of the server.
    Therefore in all SSL connections the server must have a certificate. This
    serves both to authenticate the server to the clients and to perform the key
    exchange.</p>
<p class="Pp">Sometimes it is necessary to authenticate the client as well. Two
    options are available: HTTP basic authentication and a client side
    certificate. The basic authentication over HTTPS is actually quite safe
    because HTTPS guarantees that the password will not travel in the clear.
    Never-the-less, problems like easily guessable passwords remain. The client
    certificate method involves authentication of the client at the SSL level
    using a certificate. For this to work, both the client and the server have
    certificates (which typically are different) and private keys.</p>
<p class="Pp">The API functions outlined above accept additional arguments that
    allow one to supply the client side certificate and key files. The format of
    these files is the same as used for server certificates and the caveat about
    encrypting private keys applies.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  ($page, $result, %headers) =                                   # 2c
         = get_https('www.bacus.pt', 443, '/protected.html',
              make_headers(Authorization =&gt;
                           'Basic ' . MIME::Base64::encode(&quot;$user:$pass&quot;,'')),
              '', $mime_type6, $path_to_crt7, $path_to_key8);

  ($page, $response, %reply_headers)
         = post_https('www.bacus.pt', 443, '/foo.cgi',           # 3b
              make_headers('Authorization' =&gt;
                           'Basic ' . MIME::Base64::encode(&quot;$user:$pass&quot;,'')),
              make_form(OK   =&gt; '1', name =&gt; 'Sampo'),
              $mime_type6, $path_to_crt7, $path_to_key8);
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><b>Case 2c (in SYNOPSIS)</b> demonstrates getting a password
    protected page that also requires a client certificate, i.e. it is possible
    to use both authentication methods simultaneously.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Case 3b (in SYNOPSIS)</b> is a full blown POST to a secure
    server that requires both password authentication and a client certificate,
    just like in case 2c.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note: The client will not send a certificate unless the server
    requests one. This is typically achieved by setting the verify mode to
    <span class="Li">&quot;VERIFY_PEER&quot;</span> on the server:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  Net::SSLeay::set_verify(ssl, Net::SSLeay::VERIFY_PEER, 0);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">See <span class="Li">&quot;perldoc
    ~openssl/doc/ssl/SSL_CTX_set_verify.pod&quot;</span> for a full
  description.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Working through a web proxy</i></p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd>set_proxy</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;Net::SSLeay&quot;</span> can use a web
    proxy to make its connections. You need to first set the proxy host and port
    using <span class="Li">&quot;set_proxy()&quot;</span> and then just use the
    normal API functions, e.g:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  Net::SSLeay::set_proxy('gateway.myorg.com', 8080);
  ($page) = get_https('www.bacus.pt', 443, '/');
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If your proxy requires authentication, you can supply a username
    and password as well</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  Net::SSLeay::set_proxy('gateway.myorg.com', 8080, 'joe', 'salainen');
  ($page, $result, %headers) =
         = get_https('www.bacus.pt', 443, '/protected.html',
              make_headers(Authorization =&gt;
                           'Basic ' . MIME::Base64::encode(&quot;susie:pass&quot;,''))
              );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This example demonstrates the case where we authenticate to the
    proxy as <span class="Li">&quot;joe&quot;</span> and to the final web server
    as <span class="Li">&quot;susie&quot;</span>. Proxy authentication requires
    the <span class="Li">&quot;MIME::Base64&quot;</span> module to work.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>HTTP (without S) API</i></p>

    the fly. Thus regular HTTP support was evolved.</p>

<p class="Pp">As can be seen, the <span class="Li">&quot;x&quot;</span> family

<h2 class="Ss" id="Certificate_verification_and_Certificate_Revocation_Lists_(CRLs)"><a class="permalink" href="#Certificate_verification_and_Certificate_Revocation_Lists_(CRLs)">Certificate
  verification and Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs)</a></h2>
OpenSSL supports the ability to verify peer certificates. It can also optionally
  check the peer certificate against a Certificate Revocation List (CRL) from
  the certificates issuer. A CRL is a file, created by the certificate issuer
  that lists all the certificates that it previously signed, but which it now
  revokes. CRLs are in PEM format.
<p class="Pp">You can enable <span class="Li">&quot;Net::SSLeay CRL&quot;</span>
    checking like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
            &amp;Net::SSLeay::X509_STORE_set_flags
                (&amp;Net::SSLeay::CTX_get_cert_store($ssl),
                 &amp;Net::SSLeay::X509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">After setting this flag, if OpenSSL checks a peer's certificate,
    then it will attempt to find a CRL for the issuer. It does this by looking
    for a specially named file in the search directory specified by
    CTX_load_verify_locations. CRL files are named with the hash of the issuer's
    subject name, followed by <span class="Li">&quot;.r0&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;.r1&quot;</span> etc. For example
    <span class="Li">&quot;ab1331b2.r0&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;ab1331b2.r1&quot;</span>. It will read all the .r
    files for the issuer, and then check for a revocation of the peer
    certificate in all of them. (You can also force it to look in a specific
    named CRL file., see below). You can find out the hash of the issuer subject
    name in a CRL with</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
        openssl crl -in crl.pem -hash -noout
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If the peer certificate does not pass the revocation list, or if
    no CRL is found, then the handshaking fails with an error.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can also force OpenSSL to look for CRLs in one or more
    arbitrarily named files.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    my $bio = Net::SSLeay::BIO_new_file($crlfilename, 'r');
    my $crl = Net::SSLeay::PEM_read_bio_X509_CRL($bio);

        );
    } else {
        error reading CRL....
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Usually the URLs where you can download the CRLs is contained in
    the certificate itself and you can extract them with</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    my @url = Net::SSLeay::P_X509_get_crl_distribution_points($cert)
</pre>
<p class="Pp">But there is no automatic downloading of the CRLs and often these
    CRLs are too huge to just download them to verify a single certificate.
    Also, these CRLs are often in DER format which you need to convert to PEM
    before you can use it:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    openssl crl -in crl.der -inform der -out crl.pem
</pre>
<p class="Pp">So as an alternative for faster and timely revocation checks you
    better use the Online Status Revocation Protocol (OCSP).</p>

  verification and Online Status Revocation Protocol (OCSP)</a></h2>
While checking for revoked certificates is possible and fast with Certificate
  Revocation Lists, you need to download the complete and often huge list before
  you can verify a single certificate.
<p class="Pp">A faster way is to ask the CA to check the revocation of just a
    single or a few certificates using OCSP. Basically you generate for each
    certificate an OCSP_CERTID based on the certificate itself and its issuer,
    put the ids togetether into an OCSP_REQUEST and send the request to the URL
    given in the certificate.</p>
<p class="Pp">As a result you get back an OCSP_RESPONSE and need to check the
    status of the response, check that it is valid (e.g. signed by the CA) and
    finally extract the information about each OCSP_CERTID to find out if the
    certificate is still valid or got revoked.</p>
<p class="Pp">With Net::SSLeay this can be done like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    # get id(s) for given certs, like from get_peer_certificate
    # or get_peer_cert_chain. This will croak if
    # - one tries to make an OCSP_CERTID for a self-signed certificate
    # - the issuer of the certificate cannot be found in the SSL objects
    #   store, nor in the current certificate chain

    my $id = eval { Net::SSLeay::OCSP_cert2ids($ssl,$cert) };
    die &quot;failed to make OCSP_CERTID: $@&quot; if $@;

    # create OCSP_REQUEST from id(s)
    # Multiple can be put into the same request, if the same OCSP responder
    # is responsible for them.

    # determine URI of OCSP responder
    my $uri = Net::SSLeay::P_X509_get_ocsp_uri($cert);

    # Send stringified OCSP_REQUEST with POST to $uri.
    # We can ignore certificate verification for https, because the OCSP
    # response itself is signed.

    }

    # Verify signature of response and if nonce matches request.
    # This will croak if there is a nonce in the response, but it does not match
    # the request. It will return false if the signature could not be verified,
    # in which case details can be retrieved with Net::SSLeay::ERR_get_error.
    # It will not complain if the response does not contain a nonce, which is
    # usually the case with pre-signed responses.
    if ( ! eval { Net::SSLeay::OCSP_response_verify($ssl,$resp,$req) }) {
        die &quot;OCSP response verification failed&quot;;
    }

    # Extract information from OCSP_RESPONSE for each of the ids.

    # If called in scalar context it will return the time (as time_t), when the
    # next update is due (minimum of all successful responses inside $resp). It
    # will croak on the following problems:
    # - response is expired or not yet valid
    # - no response for given OCSP_CERTID
    # - certificate status is not good (e.g. revoked or unknown)
    if ( my $nextupd = eval { Net::SSLeay::OCSP_response_results($resp,$id) }) {

            ($nextupd-time()).&quot; seconds\n&quot;;
    } else {
        die &quot;certificate is not valid: $@&quot;;
    }

    # But in array context it will return detailed information about each given
    # OCSP_CERTID instead croaking on errors:
    # if no @ids are given it will return information about all single responses
    # in the OCSP_RESPONSE
    my @results = Net::SSLeay::OCSP_response_results($resp,@ids);
    for my $r (@results) {
        print Dumper($r);
        # @results are in the same order as the @ids and contain:
        # $r-&gt;[0] - OCSP_CERTID
        # $r-&gt;[1] - undef if no error (certificate good) OR error message as string
        # $r-&gt;[2] - hash with details:

<p class="Pp">To further speed up certificate revocation checking one can use a

<h2 class="Ss" id="Using_Net::SSLeay_in_multi-threaded_applications"><a class="permalink" href="#Using_Net::SSLeay_in_multi-threaded_applications">Using
  Net::SSLeay in multi-threaded applications</a></h2>
<b>IMPORTANT: versions 1.42 or earlier are not thread-safe!</b>
<p class="Pp">Net::SSLeay module implements all necessary stuff to be ready for
    multi-threaded environment - it requires openssl-0.9.7 or newer. The
    implementation fully follows thread safety related requirements of openssl
    library(see &lt;http://www.openssl.org/docs/crypto/threads.html&gt;).</p>
<p class="Pp">If you are about to use Net::SSLeay (or any other module based on
    Net::SSLeay) in multi-threaded perl application it is recommended to follow
    this best-practice:</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Initialization</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Load and initialize Net::SSLeay module in the main thread:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    use threads;
    use Net::SSLeay;

    Net::SSLeay::load_error_strings();
    Net::SSLeay::SSLeay_add_ssl_algorithms();
    Net::SSLeay::randomize();

    sub do_master_job {
      #... call whatever from Net::SSLeay
    }

    sub do_worker_job {
      #... call whatever from Net::SSLeay
    }

    #start threads
    my $master  = threads-&gt;new(\&amp;do_master_job, 'param1', 'param2');
    my @workers = threads-&gt;new(\&amp;do_worker_job, 'arg1', 'arg2') for (1..10);

    #waiting for all threads to finish
    $_-&gt;join() for (threads-&gt;list);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">NOTE: Openssl's <span class="Li">&quot;int
    SSL_library_init(void)&quot;</span> function (which is also aliased as
    <span class="Li">&quot;SSLeay_add_ssl_algorithms&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;OpenSSL_add_ssl_algorithms&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;add_ssl_algorithms&quot;</span>) is not re-entrant
    and multiple calls can cause a crash in threaded application. Net::SSLeay
    implements flags preventing repeated calls to this function, therefore even
    multiple initialization via <b>Net::SSLeay::SSLeay_add_ssl_algorithms()</b>
    should work without trouble.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Using callbacks</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Do not use callbacks across threads (the module blocks
    cross-thread callback operations and throws a warning). Always do the
    callback setup, callback use and callback destruction within the same
    thread.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Using openssl elements</i></p>
<p class="Pp">All openssl elements (X509, SSL_CTX, ...) can be directly passed
    between threads.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    use threads;
    use Net::SSLeay;

    Net::SSLeay::load_error_strings();
    Net::SSLeay::SSLeay_add_ssl_algorithms();
    Net::SSLeay::randomize();

    sub do_job {
      my $context = shift;
      Net::SSLeay::CTX_set_default_passwd_cb($context, sub { &quot;secret&quot; });
      #...
    }

    my $c = Net::SSLeay::CTX_new();
    threads-&gt;create(\&amp;do_job, $c);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Or:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    use threads;
    use Net::SSLeay;

    my $context; #does not need to be 'shared'

    Net::SSLeay::load_error_strings();
    Net::SSLeay::SSLeay_add_ssl_algorithms();
    Net::SSLeay::randomize();

    sub do_job {
      Net::SSLeay::CTX_set_default_passwd_cb($context, sub { &quot;secret&quot; });
      #...
    }

    $context = Net::SSLeay::CTX_new();
    threads-&gt;create(\&amp;do_job);
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><i>Using other perl modules based on Net::SSLeay</i></p>
<p class="Pp">It should be fine to use any other module based on Net::SSLeay
    (like IO::Socket::SSL) in multi-threaded applications. It is generally
    recommended to do any global initialization of such a module in the main
    thread before calling
    <span class="Li">&quot;threads-&gt;new(..)&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;threads-&gt;create(..)&quot;</span> but it might
    differ module by module.</p>
<p class="Pp">To be safe you can load and init Net::SSLeay explicitly in the
    main thread:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    use Net::SSLeay;
    use Other::SSLeay::Based::Module;

    Net::SSLeay::load_error_strings();
    Net::SSLeay::SSLeay_add_ssl_algorithms();
    Net::SSLeay::randomize();
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Or even safer:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    use Net::SSLeay;
    use Other::SSLeay::Based::Module;

    BEGIN {
      Net::SSLeay::load_error_strings();
      Net::SSLeay::SSLeay_add_ssl_algorithms();
      Net::SSLeay::randomize();
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><i>Combining Net::SSLeay with other modules linked with
    openssl</i></p>
<p class="Pp"><b>BEWARE: This might be a big trouble! This is not guaranteed be
    thread-safe!</b></p>
<p class="Pp">There are many other (XS) modules linked directly to openssl
    library (like Crypt::SSLeay).</p>
<p class="Pp">As it is expected that also &quot;another&quot; module will call
    <span class="Li">&quot;SSLeay_add_ssl_algorithms&quot;</span> at some point
    we have again a trouble with multiple openssl initialization by Net::SSLeay
    and &quot;another&quot; module.</p>
<p class="Pp">As you can expect Net::SSLeay is not able to avoid multiple
    initialization of openssl library called by &quot;another&quot; module, thus
    you have to handle this on your own (in some cases it might not be possible
    at all to avoid this).</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Threading with get_https and friends</i></p>
<p class="Pp">The convenience functions get_https, post_https etc all initialize
    the SSL library by calling Net::SSLeay::initialize which does the
    conventional library initialization:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    Net::SSLeay::load_error_strings();
    Net::SSLeay::SSLeay_add_ssl_algorithms();
    Net::SSLeay::randomize();
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Net::SSLeay::initialize initializes the SSL library at most once.
    You can override the Net::SSLeay::initialize function if you desire some
    other type of initialization behaviour by get_https and friends. You can
    call Net::SSLeay::initialize from your own code if you desire this
    conventional library initialization.</p>

Perl uses file handles for all I/O. While SSLeay has a quite flexible BIO
  mechanism and perl has an evolved PerlIO mechanism, this module still sticks
  to using file descriptors. Thus to attach SSLeay to a socket you should use

  descriptor:
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    Net::SSLeay::set_fd($ssl, fileno(S));   # Must use fileno

<p class="Pp">You should also set <span class="Li">$|</span> to 1 to eliminate

<h2 class="Ss" id="Low_level__s-1API_s0"><a class="permalink" href="#Low_level__s-1API_s0">Low
  level API</a></h2>
In addition to the high level functions outlined above, this module contains
  straight-forward access to CRYPTO and SSL parts of OpenSSL C API.
<p class="Pp">See the <span class="Li">&quot;*.h&quot;</span> headers from
    OpenSSL C distribution for a list of low level SSLeay functions to call
    (check SSLeay.xs to see if some function has been implemented). The module
    strips the initial <span class="Li">&quot;SSL_&quot;</span> off of the
    SSLeay names. Generally you should use
    <span class="Li">&quot;Net::SSLeay::&quot;</span> in its place.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that some functions are prefixed with
    <span class="Li">&quot;P_&quot;</span> - these are very close to the
    original API however contain some kind of a wrapper making its interface
    more perl friendly.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example:</p>
<p class="Pp">In C:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
        #include &lt;ssl.h&gt;

        err = SSL_set_verify (ssl, SSL_VERIFY_CLIENT_ONCE,
                                   &amp;your_call_back_here);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">In Perl:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
        use Net::SSLeay;

        $err = Net::SSLeay::set_verify ($ssl,
                                        Net::SSLeay::VERIFY_CLIENT_ONCE,
                                        \&amp;your_call_back_here);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If the function does not start with
    <span class="Li">&quot;SSL_&quot;</span> you should use the full function
    name, e.g.:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
        $err = Net::SSLeay::ERR_get_error;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The following new functions behave in perlish way:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
        $got = Net::SSLeay::read($ssl);
                                    # Performs SSL_read, but returns $got
                                    # resized according to data received.
                                    # Returns undef on failure.

        Net::SSLeay::write($ssl, $foo) || die;
                                    # Performs SSL_write, but automatically
                                    # figures out the size of $foo

    <p class="Pp">OpenSSL will call the function without a key name if it
        generates a new ticket. It then needs the callback to return the
        encryption+HMAC key and an identifier (key name) for this key.</p>
    <p class="Pp">When OpenSSL gets a session ticket from the client it extracts
        the key name and calls the callback with this name as argument. It then
        expects the callback to return the encryption+HMAC key matching the
        requested key name and and also the key name which should be used at the
        moment. If the requested key name and the returned key name differ it
        means that this session ticket was created with an expired key and need
        to be renewed. In this case OpenSSL will call the callback again with no
        key name to create a new session ticket based on the old one.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The key must be at least 32 byte of random data which can be
        created with RAND_bytes. Internally the first 16 byte are used as key in
        AES-128 encryption while the next 16 byte are used for the SHA-256 HMAC.
        The key name are binary data and must be exactly 16 byte long.</p>

There are many openssl constants available in Net::SSLeay. You can use them like
  this:
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
 use Net::SSLeay;
 print &amp;Net::SSLeay::NID_commonName;
 #or
 print Net::SSLeay::NID_commonName();
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Or you can import them and use:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
 use Net::SSLeay qw/NID_commonName/;
 print &amp;NID_commonName;
 #or
 print NID_commonName();
 #or
 print NID_commonName;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The constants names are derived from openssl constants, however
    constants starting with <span class="Li">&quot;SSL_&quot;</span> prefix have
    name with <span class="Li">&quot;SSL_&quot;</span> part stripped - e.g.
    openssl's constant <span class="Li">&quot;SSL_OP_ALL&quot;</span> is
    available as <span class="Li">&quot;Net::SSleay::OP_ALL&quot;</span></p>

<p class="Pp">Yet another echo server. This one runs from

<span class="Li">&quot;Net::SSLeay::read()&quot;</span> uses an internal buffer

  much less, usually as much as fits in one network packet. To work around this,
  you should use a loop like this:
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>

  BUGS AND CAVEATS</a></h1>
An OpenSSL bug CVE-2015-0290 &quot;OpenSSL Multiblock Corrupted Pointer
  Issue&quot; can cause POST requests of over 90kB to fail or crash. This bug is
  reported to be fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2a.
<p class="Pp">Autoloader emits a</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    Argument &quot;xxx&quot; isn't numeric in entersub at blib/lib/Net/SSLeay.pm'
</pre>
<p class="Pp">warning if die_if_ssl_error is made autoloadable. If you figure
    out why, drop me a line.</p>
<p class="Pp">Callback set using
    <span class="Li">&quot;SSL_set_verify()&quot;</span> does not appear to
    work. This may well be an openssl problem (e.g. see
    <span class="Li">&quot;ssl/ssl_lib.c&quot;</span> line 1029). Try using
    <span class="Li">&quot;SSL_CTX_set_verify()&quot;</span> instead and do not
    be surprised if even this stops working in future versions.</p>
<p class="Pp">Callback and certificate verification stuff is generally too
    little tested.</p>
<p class="Pp">Random numbers are not initialized randomly enough, especially if
    you do not have <span class="Li">&quot;/dev/random&quot;</span> and/or
    <span class="Li">&quot;/dev/urandom&quot;</span> (such as in Solaris
    platforms - but it's been suggested that cryptorand daemon from the SUNski
    package solves this). In this case you should investigate third party
    software that can emulate these devices, e.g. by way of a named pipe to some
    program.</p>
<p class="Pp">Another gotcha with random number initialization is randomness
    depletion. This phenomenon, which has been extensively discussed in OpenSSL,
    Apache-SSL, and Apache-mod_ssl forums, can cause your script to block if you
    use <span class="Li">&quot;/dev/random&quot;</span> or to operate insecurely
    if you use <span class="Li">&quot;/dev/urandom&quot;</span>. What happens is
    that when too much randomness is drawn from the operating system's
    randomness pool then randomness can temporarily be unavailable.
    <span class="Li">&quot;/dev/random&quot;</span> solves this problem by
    waiting until enough randomness can be gathered - and this can take a long
    time since blocking reduces activity in the machine and less activity
    provides less random events: a vicious circle.
    <span class="Li">&quot;/dev/urandom&quot;</span> solves this dilemma more
    pragmatically by simply returning predictable &quot;random&quot; numbers.
    Some<span class="Li">&quot; /dev/urandom&quot;</span> emulation software
    however actually seems to implement
    <span class="Li">&quot;/dev/random&quot;</span> semantics. Caveat
  emptor.</p>
<p class="Pp">I've been pointed to two such daemons by Mik Firestone
    &lt;mik@@speed.stdio._com&gt; who has used them on Solaris 8:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>1.</dt>
  <dd>Entropy Gathering Daemon (EGD) at
      &lt;http://www.lothar.com/tech/crypto/&gt;</dd>
  <dt>2.</dt>
  <dd>Pseudo-random number generating daemon (PRNGD) at
      &lt;http://www.aet.tu-cottbus.de/personen/jaenicke/postfix_tls/prngd.html&gt;</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">If you are using the low level API functions to communicate with
    other SSL implementations, you would do well to call</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    Net::SSLeay::CTX_set_options($ctx, &amp;Net::SSLeay::OP_ALL)
         or die_if_ssl_error(&quot;ssl ctx set options&quot;);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">to cope with some well know bugs in some other SSL
    implementations. The high level API functions always set all known
    compatibility options.</p>
<p class="Pp">Sometimes <span class="Li">&quot;sslcat()&quot;</span> (and the
    high level HTTPS functions that build on it) is too fast in signaling the
    EOF to legacy HTTPS servers. This causes the server to return empty page. To
    work around this problem you can set the global variable</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    $Net::SSLeay::slowly = 1;   # Add sleep so broken servers can keep up
</pre>
<p class="Pp">HTTP/1.1 is not supported. Specifically this module does not know
    to issue or serve multiple http requests per connection. This is a serious
    shortcoming, but using the SSL session cache on your server helps to
    alleviate the CPU load somewhat.</p>
<p class="Pp">As of version 1.09 many newer OpenSSL auxiliary functions were
    added (from
    <span class="Li">&quot;REM_AUTOMATICALLY_GENERATED_1_09&quot;</span> onwards
    in <span class="Li">&quot;SSLeay.xs&quot;</span>). Unfortunately I have not
    had any opportunity to test these. Some of them are trivial enough that I
    believe they &quot;just work&quot;, but others have rather complex
    interfaces with function pointers and all. In these cases you should proceed
    wit great caution.</p>
<p class="Pp">This module defaults to using OpenSSL automatic protocol
    negotiation code for automatically detecting the version of the SSL/TLS
    protocol that the other end talks. With most web servers this works just
    fine, but once in a while I get complaints from people that the module does
    not work with some web servers. Usually this can be solved by explicitly
    setting the protocol version, e.g.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
   $Net::SSLeay::ssl_version = 2;  # Insist on SSLv2
   $Net::SSLeay::ssl_version = 3;  # Insist on SSLv3
   $Net::SSLeay::ssl_version = 10; # Insist on TLSv1
   $Net::SSLeay::ssl_version = 11; # Insist on TLSv1.1
   $Net::SSLeay::ssl_version = 12; # Insist on TLSv1.2
   $Net::SSLeay::ssl_version = 13; # Insist on TLSv1.3
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Although the autonegotiation is nice to have, the SSL standards do
    not formally specify any such mechanism. Most of the world has accepted the
    SSLeay/OpenSSL way of doing it as the de facto standard. But for the few
    that think differently, you have to explicitly speak the correct version.
    This is not really a bug, but rather a deficiency in the standards. If a
    site refuses to respond or sends back some nonsensical error codes (at the
    SSL handshake level), try this option before mailing me.</p>
<p class="Pp">On some systems, OpenSSL may be compiled without support for
    SSLv2. If this is the case, Net::SSLeay will warn if ssl_version has been
    set to 2.</p>
<p class="Pp">The high level API returns the certificate of the peer, thus
    allowing one to check what certificate was supplied. However, you will only
    be able to check the certificate after the fact, i.e. you already sent your
    form data by the time you find out that you did not trust them, oops.</p>
<p class="Pp">So, while being able to know the certificate after the fact is
    surely useful, the security minded would still choose to do the connection
    and certificate verification first and only then exchange data with the
    site. Currently none of the high level API functions do this, thus you would
    have to program it using the low level API. A good place to start is to see
    how the <span class="Li">&quot;Net::SSLeay::http_cat()&quot;</span> function
    is implemented.</p>
<p class="Pp">The high level API functions use a global file handle
    <span class="Li">&quot;SSLCAT_S&quot;</span> internally. This really should
    not be a problem because there is no way to interleave the high level API
    functions, unless you use threads (but threads are not very well supported
    in perl anyway). However, you may run into problems if you call undocumented
    internal functions in an interleaved fashion. The best solution is to
    &quot;require Net::SSLeay&quot; in one thread after all the threads have
    been created.</p>

  http://blog.zoller.lu/2011/09/beast-summary-tls-cbc-countermeasures.html
<p class="Pp">The BEAST attack relies on a weakness in the way CBC mode is used
    in SSL/TLS. In OpenSSL versions 0.9.6d and later, the protocol-level
    mitigation is enabled by default, thus making it not vulnerable to the BEAST
    attack.</p>

<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Compile with OpenSSL versions 0.9.6d or later, which enables SSL_OP_ALL by
      default</li>
  <li>Ensure SSL_OP_DONT_INSERT_EMPTY_FRAGMENTS is not enabled (its not enabled
