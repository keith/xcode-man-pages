<p class="Pp">Using this function, you can explicitly mark a running connection
    to get paused, and you can unpause a connection that was previously
  paused.</p>
<p class="Pp">A connection can be paused by using this function or by letting
    the read or the write callbacks return the proper magic return code
    (<i>CURL_READFUNC_PAUSE</i> and <i>CURL_WRITEFUNC_PAUSE</i>). A write
    callback that returns pause signals to the library that it could not take
    care of any data at all, and that data will then be delivered again to the
    callback when the transfer is unpaused.</p>
<p class="Pp">While it may feel tempting, take care and notice that you cannot
    call this function from another thread. To unpause, you may for example call
    it from the progress callback (<i>CURLOPT_PROGRESSFUNCTION(3)</i>).</p>
<p class="Pp">When this function is called to unpause receiving, the chance is
    high that you will get your write callback called before this function
    returns.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>handle</b> argument identifies the transfer you want to
    pause or unpause.</p>
<p class="Pp">A paused transfer is excluded from low speed cancels via the
    <i>CURLOPT_LOW_SPEED_LIMIT(3)</i> option and unpausing a transfer will reset
    the time period required for the low speed limit to be met.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>bitmask</b> argument is a set of bits that sets the new
    state of the connection. The following bits can be used:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="CURLPAUSE_RECV"><a class="permalink" href="#CURLPAUSE_RECV">CURLPAUSE_RECV</a></dt>
  <dd>Pause receiving data. There will be no data received on this connection
      until this function is called again without this bit set. Thus, the write
      callback (<i>CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION(3)</i>) will not be called.</dd>
  <dt id="CURLPAUSE_SEND"><a class="permalink" href="#CURLPAUSE_SEND">CURLPAUSE_SEND</a></dt>
  <dd>Pause sending data. There will be no data sent on this connection until
      this function is called again without this bit set. Thus, the read
      callback (<i>CURLOPT_READFUNCTION(3)</i>) will not be called.</dd>
  <dt id="CURLPAUSE_ALL"><a class="permalink" href="#CURLPAUSE_ALL">CURLPAUSE_ALL</a></dt>
  <dd>Convenience define that pauses both directions.</dd>
  <dt id="CURLPAUSE_CONT"><a class="permalink" href="#CURLPAUSE_CONT">CURLPAUSE_CONT</a></dt>

<h1 class="Sh" id="LIMITATIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#LIMITATIONS">LIMITATIONS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The pausing of transfers does not work with protocols that work
    without network connectivity, like FILE://. Trying to pause such a transfer,
    in any direction, will cause problems in the worst case or an error in the
    best case.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="MULTIPLEXED"><a class="permalink" href="#MULTIPLEXED">MULTIPLEXED</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">When a connection is used multiplexed, like for HTTP/2, and one of
    the transfers over the connection is paused and the others continue flowing,
    libcurl might end up buffering contents for the paused transfer. It has to
    do this because it needs to drain the socket for the other transfers and the
    already announced window size for the paused transfer will allow the server
    to continue sending data up to that window size amount. By default, libcurl
    announces a 32 megabyte window size, which thus can make libcurl end up
    buffering 32 megabyte of data for a paused stream.</p>
<p class="Pp">When such a paused stream is unpaused again, any buffered data
    will be delivered first.</p>

<section class="Sh">

<pre>/* pause a transfer in both directions */
curl_easy_pause(curl, CURL_READFUNC_PAUSE | CURL_WRITEFUNC_PAUSE);</pre>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="MEMORY_USE"><a class="permalink" href="#MEMORY_USE">MEMORY
  USE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">When pausing a read by returning the magic return code from a
    write callback, the read data is already in libcurl's internal buffers so it
    will have to keep it in an allocated buffer until the receiving is again
    unpaused using this function.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the downloaded data is compressed and is asked to get
    uncompressed automatically on download, libcurl will continue to uncompress
    the entire downloaded chunk and it will cache the data uncompressed. This
    has the side- effect that if you download something that is compressed a
    lot, it can result in a large data amount needing to be allocated to save
    the data during the pause. This said, you should probably consider not using
    paused receiving if you allow libcurl to uncompress data automatically.</p>

<p class="Pp">CURLE_OK (zero) means that the option was set properly, and a
    non-zero return code means something wrong occurred after the new state was
    set. See the <i>libcurl-errors(3)</i> man page for the full list with
    descriptions.</p>
