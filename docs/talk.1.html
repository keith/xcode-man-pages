<p class="Pp">The <code class="Nm">talk</code> utility is a visual communication
    program which copies lines from your terminal to that of another user.</p>
<p class="Pp">Options available:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><var class="Ar">person</var></dt>
  <dd>If you wish to talk to someone on your own machine, then
      <var class="Ar">person</var> is just the person's login name. If you wish
      to talk to a user on another host, then <var class="Ar">person</var> is of
      the form &#x2018;<code class="Li">user@host</code>&#x2019; or
      &#x2018;<code class="Li">host!user</code>&#x2019; or
      &#x2018;<code class="Li">host:user</code>&#x2019;.</dd>
  <dt><var class="Ar">ttyname</var></dt>
  <dd>If you wish to talk to a user who is logged in more than once, the
      <var class="Ar">ttyname</var> argument may be used to indicate the
      appropriate terminal name, where <var class="Ar">ttyname</var> is of the
      form &#x2018;<code class="Li">ttyXX</code>&#x2019;.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">When first called, <code class="Nm">talk</code> sends the
  message</p>
<div class="Bd Bd-indent Li">
<pre>Message from TalkDaemon@his_machine...
talk: connection requested by your_name@your_machine.
talk: respond with: talk your_name@your_machine</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">to the user you wish to talk to. At this point, the recipient of
    the message should reply by typing</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd Bd-indent"><code class="Li">talk
  &#x00A0;your_name@your_machine</code></div>
<p class="Pp">It does not matter from which machine the recipient replies, as
    long as his login-name is the same. Once communication is established, the
    two parties may type simultaneously, with their output appearing in separate
    windows. Typing control-L &#x2018;<code class="Li">^L</code>&#x2019; will
    cause the screen to be reprinted. Typing control-D
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">^D</code>&#x2019; will clear both parts of your
    screen to be cleared, while the control-D character will be sent to the
    remote side (and just displayed by this <code class="Nm">talk</code>
    client). Your erase, kill, and word kill characters will behave normally. To
    exit, just type your interrupt character; <code class="Nm">talk</code> then
    moves the cursor to the bottom of the screen and restores the terminal to
    its previous state.</p>
<p class="Pp">Permission to talk may be denied or granted by use of the
    <a class="Xr">mesg(1)</a> command. At the outset talking is allowed.</p>

<p class="Pp">The <code class="Nm">talk</code> utility relies on the

<p class="Pp">The <code class="Nm">talk</code> command appeared in
    <span class="Ux">4.2BSD</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp" id="localhost">In <span class="Ux">FreeBSD 5.3</span>, the default
    behaviour of <code class="Nm">talk</code> was changed to treat
    local-to-local talk requests as originating and terminating at
    <a class="permalink" href="#localhost"><i class="Em">localhost</i></a>.
    Before this change, it was required that the hostname (as per
    <a class="Xr">gethostname(3)</a>) resolved to a valid IPv4 address (via
    <a class="Xr">gethostbyname(3)</a>), making <code class="Nm">talk</code>
    unsuitable for use in configurations where <a class="Xr">talkd(8)</a> was
    bound to the loopback interface (normally for security reasons).</p>

<p class="Pp">The version of <code class="Nm">talk</code> released with
