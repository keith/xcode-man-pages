IP is the transport layer protocol used by the Internet protocol family. Options
  may be set at the IP level when using higher-level protocols that are based on
  IP (such as TCP and UDP). It may also be accessed through a &#x201C;raw
  socket&#x201D; when developing new protocols, or special-purpose applications.
<p class="Pp">There are several IP-level <a class="Xr">setsockopt(2)</a>
    /<a class="Xr">getsockopt(2)</a> options. <code class="Dv">IP_OPTIONS</code>
    may be used to provide IP options to be transmitted in the IP header of each
    outgoing packet or to examine the header options on incoming packets. IP
    options may be used with any socket type in the Internet family. The format
    of IP options to be sent is that specified by the IP protocol specification
    (RFC-791), with one exception: the list of addresses for Source Route
    options must include the first-hop gateway at the beginning of the list of
    gateways. The first-hop gateway address will be extracted from the option
    list and the size adjusted accordingly before use. To disable previously
    specified options, use a zero-length buffer:</p>
<div class="Bd Pp">
<pre>
setsockopt(s, IPPROTO_IP, IP_OPTIONS, NULL, 0);
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><code class="Dv">IP_TOS</code> and <code class="Dv">IP_TTL</code>
    may be used to set the type-of-service and time-to-live fields in the IP
    header for <code class="Dv">SOCK_STREAM</code> and
    <code class="Dv">SOCK_DGRAM</code> sockets. For example,</p>
<div class="Bd Pp">
<pre>
int tos = IPTOS_LOWDELAY;       /* see &lt;netinet/in.h&gt; */
setsockopt(s, IPPROTO_IP, IP_TOS, &amp;tos, sizeof(tos));

int ttl = 60;                   /* max = 255 */
setsockopt(s, IPPROTO_IP, IP_TTL, &amp;ttl, sizeof(ttl));
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">If the <code class="Dv">IP_RECVDSTADDR</code> option is enabled on
    a <code class="Dv">SOCK_DGRAM</code> socket, the <a class="Xr">recvmsg</a>
    call will return the destination IP address for a UDP datagram. The
    msg_control field in the msghdr structure points to a buffer that contains a
    cmsghdr structure followed by the IP address. The cmsghdr fields have the
    following values:</p>
<div class="Bd Pp">
<pre>
cmsg_len = CMSG_LEN(sizeof(struct in_addr))
cmsg_level = IPPROTO_IP
cmsg_type = IP_RECVDSTADDR
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">If the <code class="Dv">IP_RECVTOS</code> option is enabled on a
    <code class="Dv">SOCK_DGRAM</code> or <code class="Dv">SOCK_RAW</code>
    socket, the <a class="Xr">recvmsg</a> call will return the TOS (type of
    service) field of the IP header. The msg_control field in the msghdr
    structure points to a buffer that contains a cmsghdr structure followed by
    the TOS. The cmsghdr fields have the following values:</p>
<div class="Bd Pp">
<pre>
cmsg_len = CMSG_LEN(sizeof(u_char))

<h2 class="Ss" id="Multicast_Options"><a class="permalink" href="#Multicast_Options">Multicast
  Options</a></h2>
IP multicasting is supported only on <code class="Dv">AF_INET</code> sockets of
  type <code class="Dv">SOCK_DGRAM</code> and <code class="Dv">SOCK_RAW,</code>
  and only on networks where the interface driver supports multicasting.
<p class="Pp">The <code class="Dv">IP_MULTICAST_TTL</code> option changes the
    time-to-live (TTL) for outgoing multicast datagrams in order to control the
    scope of the multicasts:</p>
<div class="Bd Pp">
<pre>
u_char ttl;	/* range: 0 to 255, default = 1 */
setsockopt(s, IPPROTO_IP, IP_MULTICAST_TTL, &amp;ttl, sizeof(ttl));
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Datagrams with a TTL of 1 are not forwarded beyond the local
    network. Multicast datagrams with a TTL of 0 will not be transmitted on any
    network, but may be delivered locally if the sending host belongs to the
    destination group and if multicast loopback has not been disabled on the
    sending socket (see below). Multicast datagrams with TTL greater than 1 may
    be forwarded to other networks if a multicast router is attached to the
    local network.</p>
<p class="Pp">For hosts with multiple interfaces, each multicast transmission is
    sent from the primary network interface. The
    <code class="Dv">IP_MULTICAST_IF</code> option overrides the default for
    subsequent transmissions from a given socket:</p>
<div class="Bd Pp">
<pre>
struct in_addr addr;
setsockopt(s, IPPROTO_IP, IP_MULTICAST_IF, &amp;addr, sizeof(addr));
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">where &quot;addr&quot; is the local IP address of the desired
    interface or <code class="Dv">INADDR_ANY</code> to specify the default
    interface. An interface's local IP address and multicast capability can be
    obtained via the <code class="Dv">SIOCGIFCONF</code> and
    <code class="Dv">SIOCGIFFLAGS</code> ioctls. Normal applications should not
    need to use this option.</p>
<p class="Pp">If a multicast datagram is sent to a group to which the sending
    host itself belongs (on the outgoing interface), a copy of the datagram is,
    by default, looped back by the IP layer for local delivery. The
    <code class="Dv">IP_MULTICAST_LOOP</code> option gives the sender explicit
    control over whether or not subsequent datagrams are looped back:</p>
<div class="Bd Pp">
<pre>
u_char loop;	/* 0 = disable, 1 = enable (default) */
setsockopt(s, IPPROTO_IP, IP_MULTICAST_LOOP, &amp;loop, sizeof(loop));
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">This option improves performance for applications that may have no
    more than one instance on a single host (such as a router demon), by
    eliminating the overhead of receiving their own transmissions. It should
    generally not be used by applications for which there may be more than one
    instance on a single host (such as a conferencing program) or for which the
    sender does not belong to the destination group (such as a time querying
    program).</p>
<p class="Pp">A multicast datagram sent with an initial TTL greater than 1 may
    be delivered to the sending host on a different interface from that on which
    it was sent, if the host belongs to the destination group on that other
    interface. The loopback control option has no effect on such delivery.</p>
<p class="Pp">A host must become a member of a multicast group before it can
    receive datagrams sent to the group. To join a multicast group, use the
    <code class="Dv">IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP</code> option:</p>
<div class="Bd Pp">
<pre>
struct ip_mreq mreq;
setsockopt(s, IPPROTO_IP, IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP, &amp;mreq, sizeof(mreq));
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">where <var class="Fa">mreq</var> is the following structure:</p>
<div class="Bd Pp">
<pre>
struct ip_mreq {
    struct in_addr imr_multiaddr; /* multicast group to join */
    struct in_addr imr_interface; /* interface to join on */
}
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><code class="Dv">imr_interface</code> should be
    <code class="Dv">INADDR_ANY</code> to choose the default multicast
    interface, or the IP address of a particular multicast-capable interface if
    the host is multihomed. Membership is associated with a single interface;
    programs running on multihomed hosts may need to join the same group on more
    than one interface. Up to <code class="Dv">IP_MAX_MEMBERSHIPS</code>
    (currently 20) memberships may be added on a single socket.</p>
<p class="Pp">To drop a membership, use:</p>
<div class="Bd Pp">
<pre>
struct ip_mreq mreq;
setsockopt(s, IPPROTO_IP, IP_DROP_MEMBERSHIP, &amp;mreq, sizeof(mreq));
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">where <var class="Fa">mreq</var> contains the same values as used
    to add the membership. Memberships are dropped when the socket is closed or
    the process exits.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Raw_IP_Sockets"><a class="permalink" href="#Raw_IP_Sockets">Raw
  IP Sockets</a></h2>
Raw IP sockets are connectionless, and are normally used with the
  <a class="Xr">sendto</a> and <a class="Xr">recvfrom</a> calls, though the
  <a class="Xr">connect(2)</a> call may also be used to fix the destination for
  future packets (in which case the <a class="Xr">read(2)</a> or
  <a class="Xr">recv(2)</a> and <a class="Xr">write(2)</a> or
  <a class="Xr">send(2)</a> system calls may be used).
<p class="Pp">If <var class="Fa">proto</var> is 0, the default protocol
    <code class="Dv">IPPROTO_RAW</code> is used for outgoing packets, and only
    incoming packets destined for that protocol are received. If
    <var class="Fa">proto</var> is non-zero, that protocol number will be used
    on outgoing packets and to filter incoming packets.</p>
<p class="Pp">Outgoing packets automatically have an IP header prepended to them
    (based on the destination address and the protocol number the socket is
    created with), unless the <code class="Dv">IP_HDRINCL</code> option has been
    set. Incoming packets are received with IP header and options intact.</p>
<p class="Pp"><code class="Dv">IP_HDRINCL</code> indicates the complete IP
    header is included with the data and may be used only with the
    <code class="Dv">SOCK_RAW</code> type.</p>
<div class="Bd Pp">
<pre>
#include &lt;netinet/ip.h&gt;

int hincl = 1;                  /* 1 = on, 0 = off */
setsockopt(s, IPPROTO_IP, IP_HDRINCL, &amp;hincl, sizeof(hincl));
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Unlike previous BSD releases, the program must set all the fields
    of the IP header, including the following:</p>
<div class="Bd Pp">
<pre>
ip-&gt;ip_v = IPVERSION;
ip-&gt;ip_hl = hlen &gt;&gt; 2;
ip-&gt;ip_id = 0;  /* 0 means kernel set appropriate value */
ip-&gt;ip_off = offset;
ip-&gt;ip_len = len;
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">Note that the ip_off and ip_len fields are in host byte order.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the header source address is set to
    <code class="Dv">INADDR_ANY,</code> the kernel will choose an appropriate
    address.</p>
