<p class="Pp">How you access/control keyboards, screens, and pointing devices
    (&quot;mice&quot;) is system-dependent. Try the following modules:</p>

<p class="Pp">In general, you don't, because you don't know whether the
    recipient has a color-aware display device. If you know that they have an
    ANSI terminal that understands color, you can use the Term::ANSIColor module
    from CPAN:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    use Term::ANSIColor;
    print color(&quot;red&quot;), &quot;Stop!\n&quot;, color(&quot;reset&quot;);

</pre>
<p class="Pp">Or like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    use Term::ANSIColor qw(:constants);

  do I read just one key without waiting for a return key?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Controlling input buffering is a remarkably system-dependent
    matter. On many systems, you can just use the <b>stty</b> command as shown
    in &quot;getc&quot; in perlfunc, but as you see, that's already getting you
    into portability snags.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    open(TTY, &quot;+&lt;/dev/tty&quot;) or die &quot;no tty: $!&quot;;
    system &quot;stty  cbreak &lt;/dev/tty &gt;/dev/tty 2&gt;&amp;1&quot;;
    $key = getc(TTY);        # perhaps this works
    # OR ELSE
    sysread(TTY, $key, 1);    # probably this does
    system &quot;stty -cbreak &lt;/dev/tty &gt;/dev/tty 2&gt;&amp;1&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The Term::ReadKey module from CPAN offers an easy-to-use interface
    that should be more efficient than shelling out to <b>stty</b> for each key.
    It even includes limited support for Windows.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    use Term::ReadKey;
    ReadMode('cbreak');
    $key = ReadKey(0);
    ReadMode('normal');
</pre>
<p class="Pp">However, using the code requires that you have a working C
    compiler and can use it to build and install a CPAN module. Here's a
    solution using the standard POSIX module, which is already on your system
    (assuming your system supports POSIX).</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    use HotKey;
    $key = readkey();
</pre>
<p class="Pp">And here's the <span class="Li">&quot;HotKey&quot;</span> module,
    which hides the somewhat mystifying calls to manipulate the POSIX termios
    structures.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    # HotKey.pm
    package HotKey;
    use strict;
    use warnings;
    use parent 'Exporter';
    our @EXPORT = qw(cbreak cooked readkey);
    use POSIX qw(:termios_h);
    my ($term, $oterm, $echo, $noecho, $fd_stdin);
    $fd_stdin = fileno(STDIN);
    $term     = POSIX::Termios-&gt;new();
    $term-&gt;getattr($fd_stdin);
    $oterm     = $term-&gt;getlflag();
    $echo     = ECHO | ECHOK | ICANON;
    $noecho   = $oterm &amp; ~$echo;
    sub cbreak {
        $term-&gt;setlflag($noecho);  # ok, so i don't want echo either
        $term-&gt;setcc(VTIME, 1);
        $term-&gt;setattr($fd_stdin, TCSANOW);
    }
    sub cooked {
        $term-&gt;setlflag($oterm);
        $term-&gt;setcc(VTIME, 0);

    sub readkey {
        my $key = '';
        cbreak();
        sysread(STDIN, $key, 1);
        cooked();

<p class="Pp">The easiest way to do this is to read a key in nonblocking mode
    with the Term::ReadKey module from CPAN, passing it an argument of -1 to
    indicate not to block:</p>

<pre>    use Term::ReadKey;

        # input was waiting and it was $char

  do I clear the screen?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">(contributed by brian d foy)</p>
<p class="Pp">To clear the screen, you just have to print the special sequence
    that tells the terminal to clear the screen. Once you have that sequence,
    output it when you want to clear the screen.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can use the Term::ANSIScreen module to get the special
    sequence. Import the <span class="Li">&quot;cls&quot;</span> function (or
    the <span class="Li">&quot;:screen&quot;</span> tag):</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    use Term::ANSIScreen qw(cls);
    my $clear_screen = cls();
    print $clear_screen;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The Term::Cap module can also get the special sequence if you want
    to deal with the low-level details of terminal control. The
    <span class="Li">&quot;Tputs&quot;</span> method returns the string for the
    given capability:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    use Term::Cap;
    my $terminal = Term::Cap-&gt;Tgetent( { OSPEED =&gt; 9600 } );
    my $clear_screen = $terminal-&gt;Tputs('cl');
    print $clear_screen;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">On Windows, you can use the Win32::Console module. After creating
    an object for the output filehandle you want to affect, call the
    <span class="Li">&quot;Cls&quot;</span> method:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    Win32::Console;
    my $OUT = Win32::Console-&gt;new(STD_OUTPUT_HANDLE);
    my $clear_string = $OUT-&gt;Cls;
    print $clear_screen;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If you have a command-line program that does the job, you can call
    it in backticks to capture whatever it outputs so you can use it later:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    my $clear_string = `clear`;
    print $clear_string;

<p class="Pp">If you have Term::ReadKey module installed from CPAN, you can use
    it to fetch the width and height in characters and in pixels:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    use Term::ReadKey;
    my ($wchar, $hchar, $wpixels, $hpixels) = GetTerminalSize();

<p class="Pp">(This question has nothing to do with the web. See a different FAQ

<p class="Pp">There's an example of this in &quot;crypt&quot; in perlfunc.
    First, you put the terminal into &quot;no echo&quot; mode, then just read

    (see POSIX or its documentation the Camel Book), or a call to the
    <b>stty</b> program, with varying degrees of portability.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can also do this for most systems using the Term::ReadKey
    module from CPAN, which is easier to use and in theory more portable.</p>

  do I read and write the serial port?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">This depends on which operating system your program is running on.
    In the case of Unix, the serial ports will be accessible through files in
    <span class="Li">&quot;/dev&quot;</span>; on other systems, device names
    will doubtless differ. Several problem areas common to all device
    interaction are the following:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="lockfiles"><a class="permalink" href="#lockfiles">lockfiles</a></dt>
  <dd>Your system may use lockfiles to control multiple access. Make sure you
      follow the correct protocol. Unpredictable behavior can result from
      multiple processes reading from one device.</dd>
  <dt id="open"><a class="permalink" href="#open">open mode</a></dt>
  <dd>If you expect to use both read and write operations on the device, you'll
      have to open it for update (see &quot;open&quot; in perlfunc for details).
      You may wish to open it without running the risk of blocking by using
      <span class="Li">&quot;sysopen()&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;O_RDWR|O_NDELAY|O_NOCTTY&quot;</span> from the
      Fcntl module (part of the standard perl distribution). See
      &quot;sysopen&quot; in perlfunc for more on this approach.</dd>
  <dt id="end"><a class="permalink" href="#end">end of line</a></dt>
  <dd>Some devices will be expecting a &quot;\r&quot; at the end of each line
      rather than a &quot;\n&quot;. In some ports of perl, &quot;\r&quot; and
      &quot;\n&quot; are different from their usual (Unix) ASCII values of
      &quot;\015&quot; and &quot;\012&quot;. You may have to give the numeric
      values you want directly, using octal (&quot;\015&quot;), hex
      (&quot;0x0D&quot;), or as a control-character specification
      (&quot;\cM&quot;).
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    print DEV &quot;atv1\012&quot;;    # wrong, for some devices
    print DEV &quot;atv1\015&quot;;    # right, for some devices
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Even though with normal text files a &quot;\n&quot; will do
        the trick, there is still no unified scheme for terminating a line that
        is portable between Unix, DOS/Win, and Macintosh, except to terminate
        <i>ALL</i> line ends with &quot;\015\012&quot;, and strip what you don't
        need from the output. This applies especially to socket I/O and
        autoflushing, discussed next.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="flushing"><a class="permalink" href="#flushing">flushing
    output</a></dt>
  <dd>If you expect characters to get to your device when you
      <span class="Li">&quot;print()&quot;</span> them, you'll want to autoflush
      that filehandle. You can use <span class="Li">&quot;select()&quot;</span>
      and the <span class="Li">$|</span> variable to control autoflushing (see
      &quot;$|&quot; in perlvar and &quot;select&quot; in perlfunc, or perlfaq5,
      &quot;How do I flush/unbuffer an output filehandle? Why must I do

        variable, as in</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    select((select($deb_handle), $| = 1)[0]);

    <pre>    use IO::Handle;
    $dev_fh-&gt;autoflush(1);

    <p class="Pp">As mentioned in the previous item, this still doesn't work

  <dt id="non-blocking"><a class="permalink" href="#non-blocking">non-blocking

  <dd>If you are doing a blocking <span class="Li">&quot;read()&quot;</span> or

      an alarm handler to provide a timeout (see &quot;alarm&quot; in perlfunc).
      If you have a non-blocking open, you'll likely have a non-blocking read,
      which means you may have to use a 4-arg
      <span class="Li">&quot;select()&quot;</span> to determine whether I/O is

<p class="Pp">You spend lots and lots of money on dedicated hardware, but this
    is bound to get you talked about.</p>
<p class="Pp">Seriously, you can't if they are Unix password files--the Unix
    password system employs one-way encryption. It's more like hashing than
    encryption. The best you can do is check whether something else hashes to
    the same string. You can't turn a hash back into the original string.
    Programs like Crack can forcibly (and intelligently) try to guess passwords,
    but don't (can't) guarantee quick success.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you're worried about users selecting bad passwords, you should

  do I trap control characters/signals?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">You don't actually &quot;trap&quot; a control character. Instead,
    that character generates a signal which is sent to your terminal's currently
    foregrounded process group, which you then trap in your process. Signals are
    documented in &quot;Signals&quot; in perlipc and the section on
    &quot;Signals&quot; in the Camel.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can set the values of the <span class="Li">%SIG</span> hash to
    be the functions you want to handle the signal. After perl catches the
    signal, it looks in <span class="Li">%SIG</span> for a key with the same
    name as the signal, then calls the subroutine value for that key.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    # as an anonymous subroutine
    $SIG{INT} = sub { syswrite(STDERR, &quot;ouch\n&quot;, 5 ) };
    # or a reference to a function
    $SIG{INT} = \&amp;ouch;
    # or the name of the function as a string
    $SIG{INT} = &quot;ouch&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Perl versions before 5.8 had in its C source code signal handlers
    which would catch the signal and possibly run a Perl function that you had
    set in <span class="Li">%SIG</span>. This violated the rules of signal
    handling at that level causing perl to dump core. Since version 5.8.0, perl
    looks at <span class="Li">%SIG</span> <b>after</b> the signal has been
    caught, rather than while it is being caught. Previous versions of this
    answer were incorrect.</p>

<p class="Pp">Assuming you're running under sufficient permissions, you should

<p class="Pp">In most cases, you write an external module to do it--see the

    <span class="Li">&quot;syscall&quot;</span> function (documented in
    perlfunc).</p>
<p class="Pp">Remember to check the modules that came with your distribution,
    and CPAN as well--someone may already have written a module to do it. On
    Windows, try Win32::API. On Macs, try Mac::Carbon. If no module has an
    interface to the C function, you can inline a bit of C in your Perl source
    with Inline::C.</p>

<p class="Pp">Historically, these would be generated by the h2ph tool, part of

    <span class="Li">cpp(1)</span> directives in C header files to files
    containing subroutine definitions, like
    <span class="Li">&quot;SYS_getitimer()&quot;</span>, which you can use as
    arguments to your functions. It doesn't work perfectly, but it usually gets
    most of the job done. Simple files like <i>errno.h</i>, <i>syscall.h</i>,
    and <i>socket.h</i> were fine, but the hard ones like <i>ioctl.h</i> nearly
    always need to be hand-edited. Here's how to install the *.ph files:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    1. Become the super-user
    2. cd /usr/include
    3. h2ph *.h */*.h
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If your system supports dynamic loading, for reasons of
    portability and sanity you probably ought to use h2xs (also part of the
    standard perl distribution). This tool converts C header files to Perl
    extensions. See perlxstut for how to get started with h2xs.</p>
<p class="Pp">If your system doesn't support dynamic loading, you still probably
    ought to use h2xs. See perlxstut and ExtUtils::MakeMaker for more

<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    system $cmd;        # using system()
    my $output = `$cmd`;        # using backticks (``)
    open (my $pipe_fh, &quot;$cmd |&quot;);    # using open()
</pre>
<p class="Pp">With <span class="Li">&quot;system()&quot;</span>, both STDOUT and
    STDERR will go the same place as the script's STDOUT and STDERR, unless the
    <span class="Li">&quot;system()&quot;</span> command redirects them.
    Backticks and <span class="Li">&quot;open()&quot;</span> read <b>only</b>
    the STDOUT of your command.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can also use the <span class="Li">&quot;open3()&quot;</span>
    function from IPC::Open3. Benjamin Goldberg provides some sample code:</p>
<p class="Pp">To capture a program's STDOUT, but discard its STDERR:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    use IPC::Open3;
    use File::Spec;
    my $in = '';
    open(NULL, &quot;&gt;&quot;, File::Spec-&gt;devnull);
    my $pid = open3($in, \*PH, &quot;&gt;&amp;NULL&quot;, &quot;cmd&quot;);

    waitpid($pid, 0);

<p class="Pp">To capture a program's STDERR, but discard its STDOUT:</p>

    while( &lt;PH&gt; ) { }
    waitpid($pid, 0);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">To capture a program's STDERR, and let its STDOUT go to our own
    STDERR:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    use IPC::Open3;
    my $in = '';
    my $pid = open3($in, &quot;&gt;&amp;STDERR&quot;, \*PH, &quot;cmd&quot;);
    while( &lt;PH&gt; ) { }
    waitpid($pid, 0);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">To read both a command's STDOUT and its STDERR separately, you can
    redirect them to temp files, let the command run, then read the temp
  files:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    use IPC::Open3;
    use IO::File;
    my $in = '';
    local *CATCHOUT = IO::File-&gt;new_tmpfile;
    local *CATCHERR = IO::File-&gt;new_tmpfile;
    my $pid = open3($in, &quot;&gt;&amp;CATCHOUT&quot;, &quot;&gt;&amp;CATCHERR&quot;, &quot;cmd&quot;);
    waitpid($pid, 0);
    seek $_, 0, 0 for \*CATCHOUT, \*CATCHERR;
    while( &lt;CATCHOUT&gt; ) {}
    while( &lt;CATCHERR&gt; ) {}
</pre>
<p class="Pp">But there's no real need for <b>both</b> to be tempfiles... the
    following should work just as well, without deadlocking:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    use IPC::Open3;
    my $in = '';
    use IO::File;
    local *CATCHERR = IO::File-&gt;new_tmpfile;

    waitpid($pid, 0);
    seek CATCHERR, 0, 0;
    while( &lt;CATCHERR&gt; ) {}
</pre>
<p class="Pp">And it'll be faster, too, since we can begin processing the
    program's stdout immediately, rather than waiting for the program to
  finish.</p>
<p class="Pp">With any of these, you can change file descriptors before the
    call:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    open(STDOUT, &quot;&gt;logfile&quot;);
    system(&quot;ls&quot;);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">or you can use Bourne shell file-descriptor redirection:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    $output = `$cmd 2&gt;some_file`;
    open (PIPE, &quot;cmd 2&gt;some_file |&quot;);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">You can also use file-descriptor redirection to make STDERR a
    duplicate of STDOUT:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    $output = `$cmd 2&gt;&amp;1`;
    open (PIPE, &quot;cmd 2&gt;&amp;1 |&quot;);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Note that you <i>cannot</i> simply open STDERR to be a dup of
    STDOUT in your Perl program and avoid calling the shell to do the
    redirection. This doesn't work:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    open(STDERR, &quot;&gt;&amp;STDOUT&quot;);
    $alloutput = `cmd args`;  # stderr still escapes
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This fails because the <span class="Li">&quot;open()&quot;</span>
    makes STDERR go to where STDOUT was going at the time of the
    <span class="Li">&quot;open()&quot;</span>. The backticks then make STDOUT
    go to a string, but don't change STDERR (which still goes to the old
    STDOUT).</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that you <i>must</i> use Bourne shell
    (<span class="Li">sh(1)</span>) redirection syntax in backticks, not
    <span class="Li">csh(1)</span>! Details on why Perl's
    <span class="Li">&quot;system()&quot;</span> and backtick and pipe opens all

</pre>
<p class="Pp">To read both a command's STDOUT and its STDERR separately, it's
    easiest to redirect them separately to files, and then read from those files
    when the program is done:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    system(&quot;program args 1&gt;program.stdout 2&gt;program.stderr&quot;);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Ordering is important in all these examples. That's because the
    shell processes file descriptor redirections in strictly left to right
    order.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    system(&quot;prog args 1&gt;tmpfile 2&gt;&amp;1&quot;);
    system(&quot;prog args 2&gt;&amp;1 1&gt;tmpfile&quot;);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The first command sends both standard out and standard error to
    the temporary file. The second command sends only the old standard output
    there, and the old standard error shows up on the old standard out.</p>

  doesn't <b>open()</b> return an error when a pipe open fails?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">If the second argument to a piped
    <span class="Li">&quot;open()&quot;</span> contains shell metacharacters,
    perl <span class="Li">&quot;fork()&quot;</span>s, then
    <span class="Li">&quot;exec()&quot;</span>s a shell to decode the
    metacharacters and eventually run the desired program. If the program
    couldn't be run, it's the shell that gets the message, not Perl. All your
    Perl program can find out is whether the shell itself could be successfully
    started. You can still capture the shell's STDERR and check it for error
    messages. See &quot;How can I capture STDERR from an external command?&quot;
    elsewhere in this document, or use the IPC::Open3 module.</p>
<p class="Pp">If there are no shell metacharacters in the argument of
    <span class="Li">&quot;open()&quot;</span>, Perl runs the command directly,
    without using the shell, and can correctly report whether the command
    started.</p>

  wrong with using backticks in a void context?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Strictly speaking, nothing. Stylistically speaking, it's not a
    good way to write maintainable code. Perl has several operators for running
    external commands. Backticks are one; they collect the output from the
    command for use in your program. The
    <span class="Li">&quot;system&quot;</span> function is another; it doesn't
    do this.</p>
<p class="Pp">Writing backticks in your program sends a clear message to the
    readers of your code that you wanted to collect the output of the command.
    Why send a clear message that isn't true?</p>
<p class="Pp">Consider this line:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    `cat /etc/termcap`;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">You forgot to check <span class="Li">$?</span> to see whether the
    program even ran correctly. Even if you wrote</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    print `cat /etc/termcap`;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">this code could and probably should be written as</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    system(&quot;cat /etc/termcap&quot;) == 0
    or die &quot;cat program failed!&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">which will echo the cat command's output as it is generated,
    instead of waiting until the program has completed to print it out. It also
    checks the return value.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;system&quot;</span> also provides direct
    control over whether shell wildcard processing may take place, whereas
    backticks do not.</p>

<p class="Pp">This is a bit tricky. You can't simply write the command like
    this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    @ok = `grep @opts '$search_string' @filenames`;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">As of Perl 5.8.0, you can use
    <span class="Li">&quot;open()&quot;</span> with multiple arguments. Just
    like the list forms of <span class="Li">&quot;system()&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;exec()&quot;</span>, no shell escapes happen.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    open( GREP, &quot;-|&quot;, 'grep', @opts, $search_string, @filenames );
    chomp(@ok = &lt;GREP&gt;);
    close GREP;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">You can also:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    my @ok = ();
    if (open(GREP, &quot;-|&quot;)) {
        while (&lt;GREP&gt;) {
            chomp;
            push(@ok, $_);
        }
        close GREP;
    } else {
        exec 'grep', @opts, $search_string, @filenames;
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Just as with <span class="Li">&quot;system()&quot;</span>, no
    shell escapes happen when you <span class="Li">&quot;exec()&quot;</span> a
    list. Further examples of this can be found in &quot;Safe Pipe Opens&quot;
    in perlipc.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that if you're using Windows, no solution to this vexing
    issue is even possible. Even though Perl emulates
    <span class="Li">&quot;fork()&quot;</span>, you'll still be stuck, because
    Windows does not have an argc/argv-style API.</p>

<p class="Pp">This happens only if your perl is compiled to use stdio instead of

  <dd>If that doesn't work, give up on your stdio package and use sysread.</dd>

<p class="Pp">Learn Perl and rewrite it. Seriously, there's no simple converter.
    Things that are awkward to do in the shell are easy to do in Perl, and this
    very awkwardness is what would make a shell-&gt;perl converter nigh-on
    impossible to write. By rewriting it, you'll think about what you're really

  do I find out if I'm running interactively or not?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">(contributed by brian d foy)</p>
<p class="Pp">This is a difficult question to answer, and the best answer is
    only a guess.</p>
<p class="Pp">What do you really want to know? If you merely want to know if one
    of your filehandles is connected to a terminal, you can try the
    <span class="Li">&quot;-t&quot;</span> file test:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    if( -t STDOUT ) {
        print &quot;I'm connected to a terminal!\n&quot;;
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">However, you might be out of luck if you expect that means there
    is a real person on the other side. With the Expect module, another program
    can pretend to be a person. The program might even come close to passing the
    Turing test.</p>
<p class="Pp">The IO::Interactive module does the best it can to give you an
    answer. Its <span class="Li">&quot;is_interactive&quot;</span> function
    returns an output filehandle; that filehandle points to standard output if
    the module thinks the session is interactive. Otherwise, the filehandle is a
    null handle that simply discards the output:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    use IO::Interactive;
    print { is_interactive } &quot;I might go to standard output!\n&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This still doesn't guarantee that a real person is answering your
    prompts or reading your output.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you want to know how to handle automated testing for your
    distribution, you can check the environment. The CPAN Testers, for instance,
    set the value of <span class="Li">&quot;AUTOMATED_TESTING&quot;</span>:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>

<p class="Pp">This sets the soft and hard limits to 10 and 20 seconds,
    respectively. After 10 seconds of time spent running on the CPU (not
    &quot;wall&quot; time), the process will be sent a signal (XCPU on some
    systems) which, if not trapped, will cause the process to terminate. If that
    signal is trapped, then after 10 more seconds (20 seconds in total) the

<p class="Pp">(answer contributed by brian d foy)</p>
<p class="Pp">When you run a Perl script, something else is running the script
    for you, and that something else may output error messages. The script might
    emit its own warnings and error messages. Most of the time you cannot tell
    who said what.</p>
<p class="Pp">You probably cannot fix the thing that runs perl, but you can
    change how perl outputs its warnings by defining a custom warning and die
    functions.</p>
<p class="Pp">Consider this script, which has an error you may not notice
    immediately.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    #!/usr/locl/bin/perl
    print &quot;Hello World\n&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">I get an error when I run this from my shell (which happens to be
    bash). That may look like perl forgot it has a
    <span class="Li">&quot;print()&quot;</span> function, but my shebang line is
    not the path to perl, so the shell runs the script, and I get the error.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    $ ./test
    ./test: line 3: print: command not found
</pre>
<p class="Pp">A quick and dirty fix involves a little bit of code, but this may
    be all you need to figure out the problem.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    #!/usr/bin/perl -w
    BEGIN {
        $SIG{__WARN__} = sub{ print STDERR &quot;Perl: &quot;, @_; };
        $SIG{__DIE__}  = sub{ print STDERR &quot;Perl: &quot;, @_; exit 1};
    }
    $a = 1 + undef;
    $x / 0;
    __END__
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The perl message comes out with &quot;Perl&quot; in front. The
    <span class="Li">&quot;BEGIN&quot;</span> block works at compile time so all
    of the compilation errors and warnings get the &quot;Perl:&quot; prefix
  too.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>

    Perl: Use of uninitialized value in division (/) at ./test line 9.
    Perl: Illegal division by zero at ./test line 9.
    Perl: Illegal division by zero at -e line 3.

<p class="Pp">If I don't see that &quot;Perl:&quot;, it's not from perl.</p>
<p class="Pp">You could also just know all the perl errors, and although there
    are some people who may know all of them, you probably don't. However, they
    all should be in the perldiag manpage. If you don't find the error in there,
    it probably isn't a perl error.</p>
<p class="Pp">Looking up every message is not the easiest way, so let perl to do

  the difference between require and use?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">(contributed by brian d foy)</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl runs <span class="Li">&quot;require&quot;</span> statement at
    run-time. Once Perl loads, compiles, and runs the file, it doesn't do
    anything else. The <span class="Li">&quot;use&quot;</span> statement is the
    same as a <span class="Li">&quot;require&quot;</span> run at compile-time,
    but Perl also calls the <span class="Li">&quot;import&quot;</span> method
    for the loaded package. These two are the same:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    use MODULE qw(import list);
    BEGIN {
        require MODULE;
        MODULE-&gt;import(import list);
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">However, you can suppress the
    <span class="Li">&quot;import&quot;</span> by using an explicit, empty
    import list. Both of these still happen at compile-time:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    use MODULE ();
    BEGIN {
        require MODULE;
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Since <span class="Li">&quot;use&quot;</span> will also call the
    <span class="Li">&quot;import&quot;</span> method, the actual value for
    <span class="Li">&quot;MODULE&quot;</span> must be a bareword. That is,
    <span class="Li">&quot;use&quot;</span> cannot load files by name, although
    <span class="Li">&quot;require&quot;</span> can:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    require &quot;$ENV{HOME}/lib/Foo.pm&quot;; # no @INC searching!
</pre>
<p class="Pp">See the entry for <span class="Li">&quot;use&quot;</span> in
    perlfunc for more details.</p>

  do I keep my own module/library directory?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">When you build modules, tell Perl where to install the
  modules.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you want to install modules for your own use, the easiest way
    might be local::lib, which you can download from CPAN. It sets various
    installation settings for you, and uses those same settings within your
    programs.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you want more flexibility, you need to configure your CPAN
    client for your particular situation.</p>
<p class="Pp">For <span class="Li">&quot;Makefile.PL&quot;</span>-based
    distributions, use the INSTALL_BASE option when generating Makefiles:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    perl Makefile.PL INSTALL_BASE=/mydir/perl
</pre>
<p class="Pp">You can set this in your
    <span class="Li">&quot;CPAN.pm&quot;</span> configuration so modules
    automatically install in your private library directory when you use the
    CPAN.pm shell:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    % cpan
    cpan&gt; o conf makepl_arg INSTALL_BASE=/mydir/perl
    cpan&gt; o conf commit
</pre>
<p class="Pp">For <span class="Li">&quot;Build.PL&quot;</span>-based
    distributions, use the --install_base option:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    perl Build.PL --install_base /mydir/perl
</pre>
<p class="Pp">You can configure <span class="Li">&quot;CPAN.pm&quot;</span> to
    automatically use this option too:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    % cpan
    cpan&gt; o conf mbuild_arg &quot;--install_base /mydir/perl&quot;
    cpan&gt; o conf commit
</pre>
<p class="Pp">INSTALL_BASE tells these tools to put your modules into
    <i>/mydir/perl/lib/perl5</i>. See &quot;How do I add a directory to my
    include path (@INC) at runtime?&quot; for details on how to run your newly
    installed modules.</p>
<p class="Pp">There is one caveat with INSTALL_BASE, though, since it acts
    differently from the PREFIX and LIB settings that older versions of
    ExtUtils::MakeMaker advocated. INSTALL_BASE does not support installing
    modules for multiple versions of Perl or different architectures under the
    same directory. You should consider whether you really want that and, if you
    do, use the older PREFIX and LIB settings. See the ExtUtils::Makemaker
    documentation for more details.</p>

  do I add the directory my program lives in to the module/library search
  path?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">(contributed by brian d foy)</p>
<p class="Pp">If you know the directory already, you can add it to
    <span class="Li">@INC</span> as you would for any other directory. You might
    <span class="Li">&quot;use lib&quot;</span> if you know the directory at
    compile time:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    use lib $directory;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The trick in this task is to find the directory. Before your
    script does anything else (such as a
    <span class="Li">&quot;chdir&quot;</span>), you can get the current working
    directory with the <span class="Li">&quot;Cwd&quot;</span> module, which
    comes with Perl:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    BEGIN {
        use Cwd;
        our $directory = cwd;
    }
    use lib $directory;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">You can do a similar thing with the value of
    <span class="Li">$0</span>, which holds the script name. That might hold a
    relative path, but <span class="Li">&quot;rel2abs&quot;</span> can turn it
    into an absolute path. Once you have the</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    BEGIN {
        use File::Spec::Functions qw(rel2abs);
        use File::Basename qw(dirname);
        my $path   = rel2abs( $0 );
        our $directory = dirname( $path );
    }
    use lib $directory;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The FindBin module, which comes with Perl, might work. It finds
    the directory of the currently running script and puts it in
    <span class="Li">$Bin</span>, which you can then use to construct the right
    library path:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    use FindBin qw($Bin);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">You can also use local::lib to do much of the same thing. Install
    modules using local::lib's settings then use the module in your program:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>     use local::lib; # sets up a local lib at ~/perl5
</pre>
<p class="Pp">See the local::lib documentation for more details.</p>

<p class="Pp">Modules are installed on a case-by-case basis (as provided by the
    methods described in the previous section), and in the operating system. All
    of these paths are stored in <span class="Li">@INC</span>, which you can
    display with the one-liner</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    perl -e 'print join(&quot;\n&quot;,@INC,&quot;&quot;)'

<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    perldoc -l Encode

<p class="Pp">to display the path to the module. In some cases (for example, the
    <span class="Li">&quot;AutoLoader&quot;</span> module), this command will
    show the path to a separate <span class="Li">&quot;pod&quot;</span> file;
    the module itself should be in the same directory, with a 'pm' file
    extension.</p>

<p class="Pp">It's a Perl 4 style file defining values for system networking
