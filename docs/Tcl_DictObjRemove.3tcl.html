   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

  	# Set up traps and other miscellaneous stuff for Tcl/Tk man pages.
  	# Start an argument description
  .b
  	# define tabbing values for .AP
  
  	# BS - start boxed text
  	# ^y = starting y location
  	# ^b = 1
  	# BE - end boxed text (draw box now)
  	Draw four-sided box normally, but don't draw top of
  	box if the box started on an earlier page.
  	# VS - start vertical sidebar
  	# ^Y = starting y location
  	# ^v = 1 (for troff;  for nroff this doesn't matter)
  	# VE - end of vertical sidebar
  	# Special macro to handle page bottom:  finish off current
  	# box/sidebar if in box/sidebar mode, then invoked standard

<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
Tcl dictionary objects have an internal representation that supports efficient
  mapping from keys to values and which guarantees that the particular ordering
  of keys within the dictionary remains the same modulo any keys being deleted
  (which removes them from the order) or added (which adds them to the end of
  the order). If reinterpreted as a list, the values at the even-valued indices
  in the list will be the keys of the dictionary, and each will be followed (in
  the odd-valued index) by the value associated with that key.
<p class="Pp">The procedures described in this man page are used to create,
    modify, index, and iterate over dictionary objects from C code.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_NewDictObj</b> creates a new, empty dictionary object. The
    string representation of the object will be invalid, and the reference count
    of the object will be zero.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_DictObjGet</b> looks up the given key within the given
    dictionary and writes a pointer to the value associated with that key into
    the variable pointed to by <i>valuePtrPtr</i>, or a NULL if the key has no
    mapping within the dictionary. The result of this procedure is
    <b>TCL_OK</b>, or <b>TCL_ERROR</b> if the <i>dictPtr</i> cannot be converted
    to a dictionary.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_DictObjPut</b> updates the given dictionary so that the
    given key maps to the given value; any key may exist at most once in any
    particular dictionary. The dictionary must not be shared, but the key and
    value may be. This procedure may increase the reference count of both key
    and value if it proves necessary to store them. Neither key nor value should
    be NULL. The result of this procedure is <b>TCL_OK</b>, or <b>TCL_ERROR</b>
    if the <i>dictPtr</i> cannot be converted to a dictionary.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_DictObjRemove</b> updates the given dictionary so that the
    given key has no mapping to any value. The dictionary must not be shared,
    but the key may be. The key actually stored in the dictionary will have its
    reference count decremented if it was present. It is not an error if the key
    did not previously exist. The result of this procedure is <b>TCL_OK</b>, or
    <b>TCL_ERROR</b> if the <i>dictPtr</i> cannot be converted to a
  dictionary.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_DictObjSize</b> updates the given variable with the number
    of key/value pairs currently in the given dictionary. The result of this
    procedure is <b>TCL_OK</b>, or <b>TCL_ERROR</b> if the <i>dictPtr</i> cannot
    be converted to a dictionary.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_DictObjFirst</b> commences an iteration across all the
    key/value pairs in the given dictionary, placing the key and value in the
    variables pointed to by the <i>keyPtrPtr</i> and <i>valuePtrPtr</i>
    arguments (which may be NULL to indicate that the caller is uninterested in
    they key or variable respectively.) The next key/value pair in the
    dictionary may be retrieved with <b>Tcl_DictObjNext</b>. Concurrent updates
    of the dictionary's internal representation will not modify the iteration
    processing unless the dictionary is unshared, when this will trigger
    premature termination of the iteration instead (which Tcl scripts cannot
    trigger via the <b>dict</b> command.) The <i>searchPtr</i> argument points
    to a piece of context that is used to identify which particular iteration is
    being performed, and is initialized by the call to <b>Tcl_DictObjFirst</b>.
    The <i>donePtr</i> argument points to a variable that is updated to be zero
    of there are further key/value pairs to be iterated over, or non-zero if the
    iteration is complete. The order of iteration is implementation-defined. If
    the <i>dictPtr</i> argument cannot be converted to a dictionary,
    <b>Tcl_DictObjFirst</b> returns <b>TCL_ERROR</b> and the iteration is not
    commenced, and otherwise it returns <b>TCL_OK</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">When <b>Tcl_DictObjFirst</b> is called upon a dictionary, a lock
    is placed on the dictionary to enable that dictionary to be iterated over
    safely without regard for whether the dictionary is modified during the
    iteration. Because of this, once the iteration over a dictionary's keys has
    finished (whether because all values have been iterated over as indicated by
    the variable indicated by the <i>donePtr</i> argument being set to one, or
    because no further values are required) the <b>Tcl_DictObjDone</b> function
    must be called with the same <i>searchPtr</i> as was passed to
    <b>Tcl_DictObjFirst</b> so that the internal locks can be released. Once a
    particular <i>searchPtr</i> is passed to <b>Tcl_DictObjDone</b>, passing it
    to <b>Tcl_DictObjNext</b> (without first initializing it with
    <b>Tcl_DictObjFirst</b>) will result in no values being produced and the
    variable pointed to by <i>donePtr</i> being set to one. It is safe to call
    <b>Tcl_DictObjDone</b> multiple times on the same <i>searchPtr</i> for each
    call to <b>Tcl_DictObjFirst</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The procedures <b>Tcl_DictObjPutKeyList</b> and
    <b>Tcl_DictObjRemoveKeyList</b> are the close analogues of
    <b>Tcl_DictObjPut</b> and <b>Tcl_DictObjRemove</b> respectively, except that
    instead of working with a single dictionary, they are designed to operate on
    a nested tree of dictionaries, with inner dictionaries stored as values
    inside outer dictionaries. The <i>keyc</i> and <i>keyv</i> arguments specify
    a list of keys (with outermost keys first) that acts as a path to the
    key/value pair to be affected. Note that there is no corresponding operation
    for reading a value for a path as this is easy to construct from repeated
    use of <b>Tcl_DictObjGet</b>. With <b>Tcl_DictObjPutKeyList</b>, nested
    dictionaries are created for non-terminal keys where they do not already
    exist. With <b>Tcl_DictObjRemoveKeyList</b>, all non-terminal keys must
    exist and have dictionaries as their values.</p>
