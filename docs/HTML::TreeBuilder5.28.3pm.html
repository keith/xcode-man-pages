(This class is part of the HTML::Tree dist.)
<p class="Pp">This class is for HTML syntax trees that get built out of HTML
    source. The way to use it is to:</p>
<p class="Pp">1. start a new (empty) HTML::TreeBuilder object,</p>
<p class="Pp">2. then use one of the methods from HTML::Parser (presumably with
    <span class="Li">&quot;$tree-&gt;parse_file($filename)&quot;</span> for
    files, or with
    <span class="Li">&quot;$tree-&gt;parse($document_content)&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;$tree-&gt;eof&quot;</span> if you've got the content
    in a string) to parse the HTML document into the tree
    <span class="Li">$tree</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">(You can combine steps 1 and 2 with the &quot;new_from_file&quot;
    or &quot;new_from_content&quot; methods.)</p>
<p class="Pp">2b. call
    <span class="Li">&quot;$root-&gt;elementify()&quot;</span> if you want.</p>
<p class="Pp">3. do whatever you need to do with the syntax tree, presumably
    involving traversing it looking for some bit of information in it,</p>
<p class="Pp">4. previous versions of HTML::TreeBuilder required you to call
    <span class="Li">&quot;$tree-&gt;delete()&quot;</span> to erase the contents
    of the tree from memory when you're done with the tree. This is not normally
    required anymore. See &quot;Weak References&quot; in HTML::Element for
    details.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="ATTRIBUTES"><a class="permalink" href="#ATTRIBUTES">ATTRIBUTES</a></h1>
Most of the following attributes native to HTML::TreeBuilder control how parsing
  takes place; they should be set <i>before</i> you try parsing into the given
  object. You can set the attributes by passing a TRUE or FALSE value as
  argument. E.g., <span class="Li">&quot;$root-&gt;implicit_tags&quot;</span>
  returns the current setting for the
  <span class="Li">&quot;implicit_tags&quot;</span> option,
  <span class="Li">&quot;$root-&gt;implicit_tags(1)&quot;</span> turns that
  option on, and <span class="Li">&quot;$root-&gt;implicit_tags(0)&quot;</span>
  turns it off.
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="implicit_tags"><a class="permalink" href="#implicit_tags">implicit_tags</a></h2>
Setting this attribute to true will instruct the parser to try to deduce
  implicit elements and implicit end tags. If it is false you get a parse tree
  that just reflects the text as it stands, which is unlikely to be useful for
  anything but quick and dirty parsing. (In fact, I'd be curious to hear from
  anyone who finds it useful to have
  <span class="Li">&quot;implicit_tags&quot;</span> set to false.) Default is
  true.
<p class="Pp">Implicit elements have the &quot;implicit&quot; in HTML::Element
    attribute set.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="implicit_body_p_tag"><a class="permalink" href="#implicit_body_p_tag">implicit_body_p_tag</a></h2>
This controls an aspect of implicit element behavior, if
  <span class="Li">&quot;implicit_tags&quot;</span> is on: If a text element
  (PCDATA) or a phrasal element (such as
  <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;em&gt;&quot;</span>) is to be inserted under
  <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;body&gt;&quot;</span>, two things can happen: if
  <span class="Li">&quot;implicit_body_p_tag&quot;</span> is true, it's placed
  under a new, implicit <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;p&gt;&quot;</span> tag. (Past
  DTDs suggested this was the only correct behavior, and this is how past
  versions of this module behaved.) But if
  <span class="Li">&quot;implicit_body_p_tag&quot;</span> is false, nothing is
  implicated -- the PCDATA or phrasal element is simply placed under
  <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;body&gt;&quot;</span>. Default is false.
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="no_expand_entities"><a class="permalink" href="#no_expand_entities">no_expand_entities</a></h2>
This attribute controls whether entities are decoded during the initial parse of
  the source. Enable this if you don't want entities decoded to their character
  value. e.g. '&amp;amp;' is decoded to '&amp;' by default, but will be
  unchanged if this is enabled. Default is false (entities will be decoded.)
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="ignore_unknown"><a class="permalink" href="#ignore_unknown">ignore_unknown</a></h2>
This attribute controls whether unknown tags should be represented as elements
  in the parse tree, or whether they should be ignored. Default is true (to
  ignore unknown tags.)
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="ignore_text"><a class="permalink" href="#ignore_text">ignore_text</a></h2>
Do not represent the text content of elements. This saves space if all you want
  is to examine the structure of the document. Default is false.
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="ignore_ignorable_whitespace"><a class="permalink" href="#ignore_ignorable_whitespace">ignore_ignorable_whitespace</a></h2>
If set to true, TreeBuilder will try to avoid creating ignorable whitespace text
  nodes in the tree. Default is true. (In fact, I'd be interested in hearing if
  there's ever a case where you need this off, or where leaving it on leads to
  incorrect behavior.)
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="no_space_compacting"><a class="permalink" href="#no_space_compacting">no_space_compacting</a></h2>
This determines whether TreeBuilder compacts all whitespace strings in the
  document (well, outside of PRE or TEXTAREA elements), or leaves them alone.
  Normally (default, value of 0), each string of contiguous whitespace in the
  document is turned into a single space. But that's not done if
  <span class="Li">&quot;no_space_compacting&quot;</span> is set to 1.
<p class="Pp">Setting <span class="Li">&quot;no_space_compacting&quot;</span> to
    1 might be useful if you want to read in a tree just to make some minor
    changes to it before writing it back out.</p>
<p class="Pp">This method is experimental. If you use it, be sure to report any
    problems you might have with it.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="p_strict"><a class="permalink" href="#p_strict">p_strict</a></h2>
If set to true (and it defaults to false), TreeBuilder will take a narrower than
  normal view of what can be under a
  <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;p&gt;&quot;</span> element; if it sees a
  non-phrasal element about to be inserted under a
  <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;p&gt;&quot;</span>, it will close that
  <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;p&gt;&quot;</span>. Otherwise it will close
  <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;p&gt;&quot;</span> elements only for other
  <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;p&gt;&quot;</span>'s, headings, and
  <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;form&gt;&quot;</span> (although the latter may be
  removed in future versions).
<p class="Pp">For example, when going thru this snippet of code,</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  &lt;p&gt;stuff
  &lt;ul&gt;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">TreeBuilder will normally (with
    <span class="Li">&quot;p_strict&quot;</span> false) put the
    <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;ul&gt;&quot;</span> element under the
    <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;p&gt;&quot;</span> element. However, with
    <span class="Li">&quot;p_strict&quot;</span> set to true, it will close the
    <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;p&gt;&quot;</span> first.</p>
<p class="Pp">In theory, there should be strictness options like this for
    other/all elements besides just
    <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;p&gt;&quot;</span>; but I treat this as a special
    case simply because of the fact that
    <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;p&gt;&quot;</span> occurs so frequently and its
    end-tag is omitted so often; and also because application of strictness
    rules at parse-time across all elements often makes tiny errors in HTML
    coding produce drastically bad parse-trees, in my experience.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you find that you wish you had an option like this to enforce
    content-models on all elements, then I suggest that what you want is
    content-model checking as a stage after TreeBuilder has finished
  parsing.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="store_comments"><a class="permalink" href="#store_comments">store_comments</a></h2>
This determines whether TreeBuilder will normally store comments found while
  parsing content into <span class="Li">$root</span>. Currently, this is off by
  default.
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="store_declarations"><a class="permalink" href="#store_declarations">store_declarations</a></h2>
This determines whether TreeBuilder will normally store markup declarations
  found while parsing content into <span class="Li">$root</span>. This is on by
  default.
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="store_pis"><a class="permalink" href="#store_pis">store_pis</a></h2>
This determines whether TreeBuilder will normally store processing instructions
  found while parsing content into <span class="Li">$root</span> -- assuming a
  recent version of HTML::Parser (old versions won't parse PIs correctly).
  Currently, this is off (false) by default.
<p class="Pp">It is somewhat of a known bug (to be fixed one of these days, if
    anyone needs it?) that PIs in the preamble (before the
    <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;html&gt;&quot;</span> start-tag) end up actually
    <i>under</i> the <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;html&gt;&quot;</span>
  element.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="warn"><a class="permalink" href="#warn">warn</a></h2>
This determines whether syntax errors during parsing should generate warnings,
  emitted via Perl's <span class="Li">&quot;warn&quot;</span> function.
<p class="Pp">This is off (false) by default.</p>

Objects of this class inherit the methods of both HTML::Parser and
  HTML::Element. The methods inherited from HTML::Parser are used for building
  the HTML tree, and the methods inherited from HTML::Element are what you use
  to scrutinize the tree. Besides this (HTML::TreeBuilder) documentation, you
  must also carefully read the HTML::Element documentation, and also skim the
  HTML::Parser documentation -- probably only its parse and parse_file methods
  are of interest.

 $root-&gt;parse_file(...)
</pre>
<p class="Pp">[An important method inherited from HTML::Parser, which see.
    Current versions of HTML::Parser can take a filespec, or a filehandle
    object, like *FOO, or some object from class IO::Handle, IO::File,
    IO::Socket) or the like. I think you should check that a given file exists
    <i>before</i> calling
    <span class="Li">&quot;$root-&gt;parse_file($filespec)&quot;</span>.]</p>
<p class="Pp">When you pass a filename to
    <span class="Li">&quot;parse_file&quot;</span>, HTML::Parser opens it in
    binary mode, which means it's interpreted as Latin-1 (ISO-8859-1). If the
    file is in another encoding, like UTF-8 or UTF-16, this will not do the
    right thing.</p>
<p class="Pp">One solution is to open the file yourself using the proper
    <span class="Li">&quot;:encoding&quot;</span> layer, and pass the filehandle
    to <span class="Li">&quot;parse_file&quot;</span>. You can automate this
    process by using &quot;html_file&quot; in IO::HTML, which will use the HTML5
    encoding sniffing algorithm to automatically determine the proper
    <span class="Li">&quot;:encoding&quot;</span> layer and apply it.</p>
<p class="Pp">In the next major release of HTML-Tree, I plan to have it use
    IO::HTML automatically. If you really want your file opened in binary mode,
    you should open it yourself and pass the filehandle to
    <span class="Li">&quot;parse_file&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The return value is <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> if

<p class="Pp">For most purposes, this is unnecessary, but if you call this after
    (after!!) you've finished building a tree, then it keeps you from
    accidentally trying to call anything but HTML::Element methods on it. (I.e.,
    if you accidentally call
    <span class="Li">&quot;$root-&gt;parse_file(...)&quot;</span> on the
    already-complete and elementified tree, then instead of charging ahead and
    <i>wreaking havoc</i>, it'll throw a fatal error -- since

<p class="Pp">In list context (as in the first case), this method returns the
    topmost non-implicit nodes in a tree. This is useful when you're parsing
    HTML code that you know doesn't expect an HTML document, but instead just a
    fragment of an HTML document. For example, if you wanted the parse tree for
    a file consisting of just this:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  &lt;li&gt;I like pie!
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Then you would get that with <span class="Li">&quot;@nodes =

    <span class="Li">@nodes</span> will contain just one element object,
    representing the <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;li&gt;&quot;</span> node (with
    &quot;I like pie!&quot; being its text child node). However, consider if you
    were parsing this:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  &lt;hr&gt;Hooboy!&lt;hr&gt;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">In that case, <span class="Li">&quot;$root-&gt;guts()&quot;</span>
    would return three items: an element object for the first

    &quot;Hooboy!&quot;, and another
    <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;hr&gt;&quot;</span> element object.</p>
<p class="Pp">For cases where you want definitely one element (so you can treat
    it as a &quot;document fragment&quot;, roughly speaking), call
    <span class="Li">&quot;guts()&quot;</span> in scalar context, as in
    <span class="Li">&quot;$parent_for_nodes = $root-&gt;guts()&quot;</span>.
    That works like <span class="Li">&quot;guts()&quot;</span> in list context;
    in fact, <span class="Li">&quot;guts()&quot;</span> in list context would
    have returned exactly one value, and if it would have been an object (as
    opposed to a text string), then that's what
    <span class="Li">&quot;guts&quot;</span> in scalar context will return.
    Otherwise, if <span class="Li">&quot;guts()&quot;</span> in list context
    would have returned no values at all, then
    <span class="Li">&quot;guts()&quot;</span> in scalar context returns undef.
    In all other cases, <span class="Li">&quot;guts()&quot;</span> in scalar
    context returns an implicit <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;div&gt;&quot;</span>
    element node, with children consisting of whatever nodes
    <span class="Li">&quot;guts()&quot;</span> in list context would have
    returned. Note that that may detach those nodes from
    <span class="Li">$root</span>'s tree.</p>

<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;disembowel()&quot;</span> method works
    just like the <span class="Li">&quot;guts()&quot;</span> method, except that
    disembowel definitively destroys the tree above the nodes that are returned.
    Usually when you want the guts from a tree, you're just going to toss out
    the rest of the tree anyway, so this saves you the bother. (Remember,

  AND ITS DISCONTENTS</a></h1>
HTML is rather harder to parse than people who write it generally suspect.
<p class="Pp">Here's the problem: HTML is a kind of SGML that permits
    &quot;minimization&quot; and &quot;implication&quot;. In short, this means
    that you don't have to close every tag you open (because the opening of a
    subsequent tag may implicitly close it), and if you use a tag that can't
    occur in the context you seem to using it in, under certain conditions the
    parser will be able to realize you mean to leave the current context and
    enter the new one, that being the only one that your code could correctly be
    interpreted in.</p>
<p class="Pp">Now, this would all work flawlessly and unproblematically if: 1)
    all the rules that both prescribe and describe HTML were (and had been)
    clearly set out, and 2) everyone was aware of these rules and wrote their
    code in compliance to them.</p>
<p class="Pp">However, it didn't happen that way, and so most HTML pages are
    difficult if not impossible to correctly parse with nearly any set of
    straightforward SGML rules. That's why the internals of HTML::TreeBuilder
    consist of lots and lots of special cases -- instead of being just a generic
    SGML parser with HTML DTD rules plugged in.</p>

The techniques that HTML::TreeBuilder uses to perform what I consider very
  robust parses on everyday code are not things that can work only in Perl. To
  date, the algorithms at the center of HTML::TreeBuilder have been implemented
  only in Perl, as far as I know; and I don't foresee getting around to
  implementing them in any other language any time soon.
<p class="Pp">If, however, anyone is looking for a semester project for an
    applied programming class (or if they merely enjoy <i>extra-curricular</i>
    masochism), they might do well to see about choosing as a topic the
    implementation/adaptation of these routines to any other interesting
    programming language that you feel currently suffers from a lack of robust
    HTML-parsing. I welcome correspondence on this subject, and point out that
    one can learn a great deal about languages by trying to translate between
    them, and then comparing the result.</p>
<p class="Pp">The HTML::TreeBuilder source may seem long and complex, but it is
    rather well commented, and symbol names are generally self-explanatory. (You
    are encouraged to read the Mozilla HTML parser source for comparison.) Some
    of the complexity comes from little-used features, and some of it comes from
    having the HTML tokenizer (HTML::Parser) being a separate module, requiring
    somewhat of a different interface than you'd find in a combined tokenizer
    and tree-builder. But most of the length of the source comes from the fact
    that it's essentially a long list of special cases, with lots and lots of
    sanity-checking, and sanity-recovery -- because, as Roseanne Rosannadanna
    once said, &quot;it's always <i>something</i>&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">Users looking to compare several HTML parsers should look at the
    source for Raggett's Tidy
    (<span class="Li">&quot;&lt;http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/tidy/&gt;&quot;</span>),
    Mozilla
    (<span class="Li">&quot;&lt;http://www.mozilla.org/&gt;&quot;</span>), and
    possibly root around the browsers section of Yahoo to find the various
    open-source ones
    (<span class="Li">&quot;&lt;http://dir.yahoo.com/Computers_and_Internet/Software/Internet/World_Wide_Web/Browsers/&gt;&quot;</span>).</p>

* Framesets seem to work correctly now. Email me if you get a strange parse from
  a document with framesets.
<p class="Pp">* Really bad HTML code will, often as not, make for a somewhat
    objectionable parse tree. Regrettable, but unavoidably true.</p>
<p class="Pp">* If you're running with
    <span class="Li">&quot;implicit_tags&quot;</span> off (God help you!),
    consider that <span class="Li">&quot;$tree-&gt;content_list&quot;</span>
    probably contains the tree or grove from the parse, and not
    <span class="Li">$tree</span> itself (which will, oddly enough, be an
    implicit <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;html&gt;&quot;</span> element). This
    seems counter-intuitive and problematic; but seeing as how almost no HTML
    ever parses correctly with <span class="Li">&quot;implicit_tags&quot;</span>
    off, this interface oddity seems the least of your problems.</p>

When a document parses in a way different from how you think it should, I ask
  that you report this to me as a bug. The first thing you should do is copy the
  document, trim out as much of it as you can while still producing the bug in
  question, and <i>then</i> email me that mini-document <i>and</i> the code
  you're using to parse it, to the HTML::Tree bug queue at
  <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;bug-html-tree&#x00A0;at&#x00A0;rt.cpan.org&gt;&quot;</span>.
<p class="Pp">Include a note as to how it parses (presumably including its
    <span class="Li">&quot;$tree-&gt;dump&quot;</span> output), and then a
    <i>careful and clear</i> explanation of where you think the parser is going
    astray, and how you would prefer that it work instead.</p>
