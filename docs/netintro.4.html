<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">This section is a general introduction to the networking
    facilities available in the system. Documentation in this part of section 4
    is broken up into three areas: <i class="Em">protocol families</i>
    (domains),
    <a class="permalink" href="#protocols"><i class="Em" id="protocols">protocols</i></a>,
    and <a class="permalink" href="#network"><i class="Em" id="network">network
    interfaces</i></a>.</p>
<p class="Pp">All network protocols are associated with a specific
    <i class="Em">protocol family</i>. A protocol family provides basic services
    to the protocol implementation to allow it to function within a specific
    network environment. These services may include packet fragmentation and
    reassembly, routing, addressing, and basic transport. A protocol family may
    support multiple methods of addressing, though the current protocol
    implementations do not. A protocol family is normally comprised of a number
    of protocols, one per <a class="Xr">socket(2)</a> type. It is not required
    that a protocol family support all socket types. A protocol family may
    contain multiple protocols supporting the same socket abstraction.</p>
<p class="Pp">A protocol supports one of the socket abstractions detailed in
    <a class="Xr">socket(2)</a>. A specific protocol may be accessed either by
    creating a socket of the appropriate type and protocol family, or by
    requesting the protocol explicitly when creating a socket. Protocols
    normally accept only one type of address format, usually determined by the
    addressing structure inherent in the design of the protocol family/network
    architecture. Certain semantics of the basic socket abstractions are
    protocol specific. All protocols are expected to support the basic model for
    their particular socket type, but may, in addition, provide non-standard
    facilities or extensions to a mechanism. For example, a protocol supporting
    the <code class="Dv">SOCK_STREAM</code> abstraction may allow more than one
    byte of out-of-band data to be transmitted per out-of-band message.</p>
<p class="Pp">A network interface is similar to a device interface. Network
    interfaces comprise the lowest layer of the networking subsystem,
    interacting with the actual transport hardware. An interface may support one
    or more protocol families and/or address formats. The SYNOPSIS section of
    each network interface entry gives a sample specification of the related
    drivers for use in providing a system description to the
    <a class="Xr">config(8)</a> program. The DIAGNOSTICS section lists messages
    which may appear on the console and/or in the system error log,
    <span class="Pa">/var/log/messages</span> (see
    <a class="Xr">syslogd(8)</a>), due to errors in device operation.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="PROTOCOLS"><a class="permalink" href="#PROTOCOLS">PROTOCOLS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The system currently supports the Internet protocols, the Xerox
    Network Systems(tm) protocols, and some of the ISO OSI protocols. Raw socket
    interfaces are provided to the IP protocol layer of the Internet, and to the
    IDP protocol of Xerox NS. Consult the appropriate manual pages in this
    section for more information regarding the support for each protocol
  family.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="ADDRESSING"><a class="permalink" href="#ADDRESSING">ADDRESSING</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Associated with each protocol family is an address format. All
    network address adhere to a general structure, called a sockaddr, described
    below. However, each protocol imposes finer and more specific structure,
    generally renaming the variant, which is discussed in the protocol family
    manual page alluded to above.</p>
<div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent Li">
<pre>    struct sockaddr {
	u_char	sa_len;
    	u_char	sa_family;
    	char	sa_data[14];
};</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The field <var class="Ar">sa_len</var> contains the total length
    of the structure, which may exceed 16 bytes. The following address values
    for <var class="Ar">sa_family</var> are known to the system (and additional
    formats are defined for possible future implementation):</p>
<div class="Bd Pp Li">
<pre>#define    AF_UNIX      1    /* local to host (pipes) */
#define    AF_INET      2    /* IPv4: UDP, TCP, etc. */
#define    AF_INET6     30   /* IPv6: UDP, TCP, etc. */
#define    AF_NS        6    /* Xerox NS protocols */
#define    AF_CCITT     10   /* CCITT protocols, X.25 etc */
#define    AF_HYLINK    15   /* NSC Hyperchannel */
#define    AF_ISO       18   /* ISO protocols */

<h1 class="Sh" id="ROUTING"><a class="permalink" href="#ROUTING">ROUTING</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Mac OS X provides some packet routing facilities. The kernel
    maintains a routing information database, which is used in selecting the
    appropriate network interface when transmitting packets.</p>
<p class="Pp">A user process (or possibly multiple co-operating processes)
    maintains this database by sending messages over a special kind of socket.
    This supplants fixed size <a class="Xr">ioctl(2)</a> used in earlier
    releases.</p>
<p class="Pp">This facility is described in <a class="Xr">route(4)</a>.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="INTERFACES"><a class="permalink" href="#INTERFACES">INTERFACES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Each network interface in a system corresponds to a path through
    which messages may be sent and received. A network interface usually has a
    hardware device associated with it, though certain interfaces such as the
    loopback interface, <a class="Xr">lo(4)</a>, do not.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following <a class="Xr">ioctl</a> calls may be used to
    manipulate network interfaces. The <a class="Xr">ioctl</a> is made on a
    socket (typically of type <code class="Dv">SOCK_DGRAM</code>) in the desired
    domain. Most of the requests supported in earlier releases take an
    <var class="Ar">ifreq</var> structure as its parameter. This structure has
    the form</p>
<div class="Bd Pp Li">
<pre>struct	ifreq {

  <dd>An interface may have more than one address associated with it in some
      protocols. This request provides a means to add additional addresses (or
      modify characteristics of the primary address if the default address for
      the address family is specified). Rather than making separate calls to set
      destination or broadcast addresses, or network masks (now an integral
      feature of multiple protocols) a separate structure is used to specify all
      three facets simultaneously (see below). One would use a slightly tailored
      version of this struct specific to each family (replacing each sockaddr by
      one of the family-specific type). Where the sockaddr itself is larger than
      the default size, one needs to modify the <a class="Xr">ioctl</a>
      identifier itself to include the total size, as described in
      <a class="Xr">ioctl</a>.</dd>
  <dt id="SIOCDIFADDR"><a class="permalink" href="#SIOCDIFADDR"><code class="Dv">SIOCDIFADDR</code></a></dt>
  <dd>This requests deletes the specified address from the list associated with
      an interface. It uses the <var class="Ar">ifreq</var> structure for
      protocols like <code class="Dv">PF_INET</code> whose address fit in the

      <code class="Dv">PF_INET6</code> with addresses that do not fit in the

  <dd>Get interface configuration list. This request takes an

      to the size of the buffer pointed to by <var class="Ar">ifc_buf</var>. On
