<p class="Pp">Please note that while <b>Module::Install</b> pioneered many great
    ideas in its time, its primary benefits have been better achieved by the
    authoring tool Dist::Zilla, and its spinoffs Dist::Milla and Minilla. These
    tools allow the author to build and maintain distributions with DWIM
    convenience, while the distribution is installed directly by
    ExtUtils::MakeMaker or similar installation tools, avoiding the complexity
    of bundling the installer. Dist::Zilla additionally has a more robust plugin
    system which makes it easier to keep up with changes to the CPAN::Meta::Spec
    and add other new functionality. Use of <b>Module::Install</b> for new
    distributions is therefore discouraged by the maintainers.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp"><b>Module::Install</b> is a package for writing installers for
    CPAN (or CPAN-like) distributions that are clean, simple, minimalist, act in
    a strictly correct manner with ExtUtils::MakeMaker, and will run on any Perl
    installation version 5.005 or newer.</p>
<p class="Pp">The intent is to make it as easy as possible for CPAN authors (and
    especially for first-time CPAN authors) to have installers that follow all
    the best practices for distribution installation, but involve as much DWIM
    (Do What I Mean) as possible when writing them.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Writing_Module::Install_Installers"><a class="permalink" href="#Writing_Module::Install_Installers">Writing
  Module::Install Installers</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The quickest way to get started with Module::Install is to copy
    the &quot;SYNOPSIS&quot; from above and save it as your own
    <i>Makefile.PL</i>. Then modify the file to suit your own particular case,
    using the list of commands documented in &quot;COMMON COMMANDS&quot;
  below.</p>
<p class="Pp">If all you want to do is write an installer, go and do that now.
    You don't really need the rest of this description unless you are interested
    in the details.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="How_it_Works"><a class="permalink" href="#How_it_Works">How
  it Works</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The motivation behind <b>Module::Install</b> is that distributions
    need to interact with a large number of different versions of perl and
    module installers infrastructure, primarily CPAN.pm, CPANPLUS.pm,
    ExtUtils::MakeMaker and Module::Build.</p>
<p class="Pp">These have accumulated <b>greatly</b> varying feature and bug
    profiles over the years, and it is now very difficult to write an installer
    that will work properly using only the installed versions of these
  modules,</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, the CPAN.pm version shipped with Perl 5.005 is now 5+
    years old and considered highly buggy, yet it still exists on quite a number
    of legacy machines.</p>
<p class="Pp">Rather than try to target one specific installer and/or make you
    add twisty workaround expressions to every piece of install code you write,
    <b>Module::Install</b> will copy part of itself into each module
    distribution it creates.</p>
<p class="Pp">This allows new improvements to be used in your installers
    regardless of the age of the system a distribution is being installed on, at
    the cost of a small increase in the size of your distribution.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="History"><a class="permalink" href="#History">History</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">This module was originally written by Brian Ingerson as a smart
    drop-in replacement for ExtUtils::MakeMaker.</p>
<p class="Pp">For more information, see Brian's <i>Creating Module Distributions
    with</i> <i>Module::Install</i> in June 2003 issue of The Perl Journal
    (&lt;http://www.drdobbs.com/web-development/creating-module-distributions-with-modul/184416018&gt;)</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="COMMON_COMMANDS"><a class="permalink" href="#COMMON_COMMANDS">COMMON
  COMMANDS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The following are the most common commands generally used in
    installers.</p>
<p class="Pp">It is far from an exhaustive list, as many of the plugins provide
    commands to work in more details that you would normally need.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="name"><a class="permalink" href="#name">name</a></h2>
<pre>  name 'My-Module';
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The <b>name</b> command is compulsory command, generally the
    first.</p>
<p class="Pp">It provides the name of your distribution, which for a module like
    <b>Your::Module</b> would normally be
    <span class="Li">&quot;Your-Module&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">This naming scheme is not hard and fast and you should note that
    distributions are actually a separate naming scheme from modules.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example the LWP modules come in a distribution called
    <span class="Li">&quot;libwww-perl&quot;</span>.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="all_from"><a class="permalink" href="#all_from">all_from</a></h2>
<pre>  all_from 'lib/My/Module.pm';
</pre>
<p class="Pp">For most simple Perl distributions that feature one dominant
    module or class as the base, you can get the most Do What I Mean
    functionality by using the <b>all_from</b> command, which will try to
    extract as much metadata as possible from the Perl code and POD in that
    primary module.</p>
<p class="Pp">Functionally, <span class="Li">&quot;all_from&quot;</span> is
    equivalent to <span class="Li">&quot;abstract_from&quot;</span> +
    <span class="Li">&quot;author_from&quot;</span> +
    <span class="Li">&quot;version_from&quot;</span> +
    <span class="Li">&quot;license_from&quot;</span> +
    <span class="Li">&quot;perl_version_from&quot;</span>. See below for
    details.</p>
<p class="Pp">If any of these values are set already <b>before</b>
    <span class="Li">&quot;all_from&quot;</span> is used, they will kept and
    <b>not</b> be overwritten.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="abstract"><a class="permalink" href="#abstract">abstract</a></h2>
<pre>  abstract 'This distribution does something';
</pre>
<p class="Pp">All distributions have an abstract, a short description of the
    distribution as a whole. It is usually around 30-70 characters long.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;abstract&quot;</span> command is used
    to explicitly set the abstract for the distribution, at least as far as the
    metadata file for the distribution is concerned.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="abstract_from"><a class="permalink" href="#abstract_from">abstract_from</a></h2>
<pre>  abstract_from 'lib/My/Module.pm';
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;abstract_from&quot;</span> command
    retrieves the abstract from a particular file contained in the distribution
    package. Most often this is done from the main module, where
    <span class="Li">&quot;Module::Install&quot;</span> will read the POD and
    use whatever is in the <span class="Li">&quot;=head1 NAME&quot;</span>
    section (with module name stripped if needed)</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;abstract_from&quot;</span> is set as part
    of <span class="Li">&quot;all_from&quot;</span>.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="author"><a class="permalink" href="#author">author</a></h2>
<pre>  author 'Adam Kennedy &lt;adamk@cpan.org&gt;';
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The distribution metadata contains information on the primary
    author or the distribution, or the primary maintainer if the original author
    is no longer involved. It should generally be specified in the form of an
    email address.</p>
<p class="Pp">It you don't want to give away a real email address, you should
    use the <span class="Li">&quot;CPANID@cpan.org&quot;</span> address you
    receive automatically when you got your PAUSE account.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;author&quot;</span> command is used to
    explicitly set this value.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="author_from"><a class="permalink" href="#author_from">author_from</a></h2>
<pre>  author_from 'lib/My/Module.pm';
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;author_from&quot;</span> command
    retrieves the author from a particular file contained in the distribution
    package. Most often this is done using the main module, where
    Module::Install will read the POD and use whatever it can find in the
    <span class="Li">&quot;=head1 AUTHOR&quot;</span> section.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="version"><a class="permalink" href="#version">version</a></h2>
<pre>  version '0.01';
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;version&quot;</span> command is used to
    specify the version of the distribution, as distinct from the version of any
    single module within the distribution.</p>
<p class="Pp">Of course, in almost all cases you want it to match the version of
    the primary module within the distribution, which you can do using
    <span class="Li">&quot;version_from&quot;</span>.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="version_from"><a class="permalink" href="#version_from">version_from</a></h2>
<pre>  version_from 'lib/My/Module.pm';
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;version_from&quot;</span> command
    retrieves the distribution version from a particular file contained in the
    distribution package. Most often this is done from the main module.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;version_from&quot;</span> will look for the
    first time you set <span class="Li">$VERSION</span> and use the same value,
    using a technique consistent with various other module version scanning
    tools.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="license"><a class="permalink" href="#license">license</a></h2>
<pre>  license 'perl';
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;license&quot;</span> command specifies
    the license for the distribution.</p>
<p class="Pp">Most often this value will be <span class="Li">'perl'</span>,
    meaning <i>&quot;the same as for Perl</i> <i>itself&quot;</i>. Other allowed
    values include <span class="Li">'gpl'</span>,
    <span class="Li">'lgpl'</span>, <span class="Li">'bsd'</span>,
    <span class="Li">'MIT'</span>, and <span class="Li">'artistic'</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">This value is always considered a summary, and it is normal for
    authors to include a <i>LICENSE</i> file in the distribution, containing the
    full license for the distribution.</p>
<p class="Pp">You are also reminded that if the distribution is intended to be
    uploaded to the CPAN, it <b>must</b> be an OSI-approved open source license.
    Commercial software is not permitted on the CPAN.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="license_from"><a class="permalink" href="#license_from">license_from</a></h2>
<pre>  license_from 'lib/My/Module.pm';
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;license_from&quot;</span> command
    retrieves the distribution license from a particular file contained in the
    distribution package. Most often this is done from the main module.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;license_from&quot;</span> will look inside
    the POD within the indicated file for a licensing or copyright-related
    section and scan for a variety of strings that identify the general class of
    license.</p>
<p class="Pp">At this time it supports only the 6 values mentioned above in the
    <span class="Li">&quot;license&quot;</span> command summary.</p>

<pre>  perl_version '5.006';
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;perl_version&quot;</span> command is
    used to specify the minimum version of the perl interpreter your
    distribution requires.</p>
<p class="Pp">When specifying the version, you should try to use the normalized
    version string. Perl version segments are 3 digits long, so a dependency on
    Perl 5.6 will become <span class="Li">'5.006'</span> and Perl 5.10.2 will
    become <span class="Li">'5.010002'</span>.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="perl_version_from"><a class="permalink" href="#perl_version_from">perl_version_from</a></h2>
<pre>  perl_version_from 'lib/My/Module.pm'
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;perl_version_from&quot;</span> command
    retrieves the minimum <i>perl</i> interpreter version from a particular file
    contained in the distribution package. Most often this is done from the main
    module.</p>
<p class="Pp">The minimum version is detected by scanning the file for
    <span class="Li">&quot;use 5.xxx&quot;</span> pragma calls in the module
    file.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="recommends"><a class="permalink" href="#recommends">recommends</a></h2>
<pre>  recommends 'Text::CSV_XS' =&gt; '0.50'
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;recommends&quot;</span> command
    indicates an optional run-time module that provides extra functionality.
    Recommended dependencies are not needed to build or test your distribution,
    but are considered &quot;nice to have&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">As with &quot;requires&quot;, the dependency is on a <b>module</b>
    and not a distribution. A version of zero indicates that any version of the
    module is recommended.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="requires"><a class="permalink" href="#requires">requires</a></h2>
<pre>  requires 'List::Util' =&gt; 0;
  requires 'LWP'        =&gt; '5.69';
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;requires&quot;</span> command indicates
    a normal run-time dependency of your distribution on another module. Most
    distributions will have one or more of these commands, indicating which CPAN
    (or otherwise) modules your distribution needs.</p>
<p class="Pp">A <span class="Li">&quot;requires&quot;</span> dependency can be
    verbalised as <i>&quot;If you wish to install</i> <i>and use this
    distribution, you must first install these modules first&quot;</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that the dependency is on a <b>module</b> and not a
    distribution. This is to ensure that your dependency stays correct, even if
    the module is moved or merged into a different distribution, as is
    occasionally the case.</p>
<p class="Pp">A dependency on version zero indicates <b>any</b> version of
    module is sufficient. Versions should generally be quoted for clarity.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="test_requires"><a class="permalink" href="#test_requires">test_requires</a></h2>
<pre>  test_requires 'Test::More' =&gt; '0.47';
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;test_requires&quot;</span> command
    indicates a test script dependency for the distribution. The specification
    format is identical to that of the
    <span class="Li">&quot;requires&quot;</span> command.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;test_requires&quot;</span> command is
    distinct from the <span class="Li">&quot;requires&quot;</span> command in
    that it indicates a module that is needed <b>only</b> during the testing of
    the distribution (often a period of only a few seconds) but will <b>not</b>
    be needed after the distribution is installed.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;testrequires&quot;</span> command is
    used to allow the installer some flexibility in how it provides the module,
    and to allow downstream packagers (Debian, FreeBSD, ActivePerl etc) to
    retain only the dependencies needed for run-time operation.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;include&quot;</span> command is
    sometimes used by some authors along with
    <span class="Li">&quot;test_requires&quot;</span> to bundle a small
    well-tested module into the distribution package itself rather than inflict
    yet another module installation on users installing from CPAN directly.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="configure_requires"><a class="permalink" href="#configure_requires">configure_requires</a></h2>
<pre>  configure_requires 'File::Spec' =&gt; '0.80';
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;configure_requires&quot;</span> command
    indicates a configure-time dependency for the distribution. The
    specification format is identical to that of the
    <span class="Li">&quot;requires&quot;</span> command.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;configure_requires&quot;</span> command
    is used to get around the conundrum of how to use a CPAN module in your
    Makefile.PL, when you have to load Makefile.PL (and thus the CPAN module) in
    order to know that you need it.</p>
<p class="Pp">Traditionally, this circular logic could not be broken and so
    Makefile.PL scripts needed to rely on lowest-common-denominator approaches,
    or to bundle those dependencies using something like the
    <span class="Li">&quot;include&quot;</span> command.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;configure_requires&quot;</span> command
    creates an entry in the special configure_requires: key in the
    distribution's <i>META.yml</i> file.</p>
<p class="Pp">Although most of <i>META.yml</i> is considered advisory only, a
    CPAN client will treat the contents of configure_requires: as authoritative,
    and install the listed modules <b>before</b> it executes the
    <i>Makefile.PL</i> (from which it then determines the other
  dependencies).</p>
<p class="Pp">Please note that support for configure_requires: in CPAN clients
    is not 100% complete at time of writing, and still cannot be relied
  upon.</p>
<p class="Pp">Because <b>Module::Install</b> itself only supports 5.005, it will
    silently add the equivalent of a <span class="Li">&quot;configure_requires(
    perl =&gt; '5.005' );&quot;</span> command to your distribution.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="requires_external_bin"><a class="permalink" href="#requires_external_bin">requires_external_bin</a></h2>
<pre>  requires_external_bin 'cvs';
</pre>
<p class="Pp">As part of its role as the dominant &quot;glue&quot; language, a
    lot of Perl modules run commands or programs on the host system.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;requires_external_bin&quot;</span>
    command is used to verify that a particular command is available on the host
    system.</p>
<p class="Pp">Unlike a missing Perl module, a missing external binary is
    unresolvable at make-time, and so the <i>Makefile.PL</i> run will abort with
    a &quot;NA&quot; (Not Applicable) result.</p>
<p class="Pp">In future, this command will also add additional information to
    the metadata for the dist, so that auto-packagers for particular operating
    system are more-easily able to auto-discover the appropriate non-Perl
    packages needed as a dependency.</p>

<pre>  # The following are equivalent
  install_script 'script/scriptname'
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;install_script&quot;</span> command
    provides support for the installation of scripts that will become available
    at the console on both Unix and Windows (in the later case by wrapping it up
    as a .bat file).</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that is it normal practice to <b>not</b> put a .pl on the end
    of such scripts, so that they feel more natural when being used.</p>
<p class="Pp">In the example above, the <i>script/scriptname</i> program could
    be run after the installation just by doing the following.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  &gt; scriptname
  Running scriptname 0.01...
  &gt;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">By convention, scripts should be placed in a /script directory
    within your distribution. To support less typing, if a script is located in
    the script directory, you need refer to it by name only.</p>

<pre>  no_index directory =&gt; 'examples';
  no_index package   =&gt; 'DB';
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Quite often a distribution will provide example scripts or testing
    modules (.pm files) as well as the actual library modules.</p>
<p class="Pp">In almost all situations, you do <b>not</b> want these indexed in
    the CPAN index, the master Perl packages list, or displayed on
    &lt;https://metacpan.org/&gt; or &lt;http://search.cpan.org/&gt; websites,
    you just want them along for the ride.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;no_index&quot;</span> command is used
    to indicate directories or files where there might be non-library .pm files
    or other files that the CPAN indexer and websites such as
    &lt;https://metacpan.org/&gt; or &lt;http://search.cpan.org/&gt; should
    explicitly ignore.</p>
<p class="Pp">The most common situation is to ignore example or demo
    directories, but a variety of different situations may require a
    <span class="Li">&quot;no_index&quot;</span> entry.</p>
<p class="Pp">Another common use for
    <span class="Li">&quot;no_index&quot;</span> is to prevent the PAUSE indexer
    complaining when your module makes changes inside a &quot;package DB&quot;
    block. This is used to interact with the debugger in some specific ways.</p>
<p class="Pp">See the <i>META.yml</i> documentation for more details on what
    <span class="Li">&quot;no_index&quot;</span> values are allowed.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>inc</i>, <i>t</i> and <i>share</i> (if
    <span class="Li">&quot;install_share&quot;</span> is used) directories are
    automatically <span class="Li">&quot;no_index&quot;</span>'ed for you if
    found and do not require an explicit command.</p>
<p class="Pp">To summarize, if you can see it on &lt;https://metacpan.org/&gt;
    or &lt;http://search.cpan.org/&gt; and you shouldn't be able to, you need a

<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;installdirs&quot;</span> and

    option. For almost all regular modules, the default is recommended, and need
    not be changed. Dual-life (core and CPAN) modules, as well as
    vendor-specific modules, may need to use the other options.</p>
<p class="Pp">If unsure, do not use this option.</p>

<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;WriteAll&quot;</span> command is
    generally the last command in the file; it writes out <i>META.yml</i> and

    test&quot;</span>, <span class="Li">&quot;make install&quot;</span> install
    sequence.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="EXTENSIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#EXTENSIONS">EXTENSIONS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">All extensions belong to the <b>Module::Install::*</b> namespace,
    and inherit from <b>Module::Install::Base</b>. There are three categories of
    extensions:</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Standard_Extensions"><a class="permalink" href="#Standard_Extensions">Standard
  Extensions</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Methods defined by a standard extension may be called as plain
    functions inside <i>Makefile.PL</i>; a corresponding singleton object will
    be spawned automatically. Other extensions may also invoke its methods just
    like their own methods:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    # delegates to $other_extension_obj-&gt;method_name(@args)
    $self-&gt;method_name(@args);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">At the first time an extension's method is invoked, a POD-stripped
    version of it will be included under the <i>inc/Module/Install/</i>
    directory, and becomes <i>fixed</i> -- i.e., even if the user had installed
    a different version of the same extension, the included one will still be
    used instead.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the author wish to upgrade extensions in <i>inc/</i> with
    installed ones, simply run <span class="Li">&quot;perl
    Makefile.PL&quot;</span> again; <b>Module::Install</b> determines whether
    you are an author by the existence of the <i>inc/.author/</i> directory.
    End-users can reinitialize everything and become the author by typing
    <span class="Li">&quot;make realclean&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;perl Makefile.PL&quot;</span>.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Private_Extensions"><a class="permalink" href="#Private_Extensions">Private
  Extensions</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Those extensions take the form of <b>Module::Install::PRIVATE</b>
    and <b>Module::Install::PRIVATE::*</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Authors are encouraged to put all existing <i>Makefile.PL</i>
    magics into such extensions (e.g. <i>Module::Install::PRIVATE</i> for common
    bits; <i>Module::Install::PRIVATE::DISTNAME</i> for functions specific to a
    distribution).</p>
<p class="Pp">Private extensions should not to be released on CPAN; simply put
    them somewhere in your <span class="Li">@INC</span>, under the
    <span class="Li">&quot;Module/Install/&quot;</span> directory, and start
    using their functions in <i>Makefile.PL</i>. Like standard extensions, they
    will never be installed on the end-user's machine, and therefore never
    conflict with other people's private extensions.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Administrative_Extensions"><a class="permalink" href="#Administrative_Extensions">Administrative
  Extensions</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Extensions under the <b>Module::Install::Admin::*</b> namespace
    are never included with the distribution. Their methods are not directly
    accessible from <i>Makefile.PL</i> or other extensions; they are invoked
    like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    # delegates to $other_admin_extension_obj-&gt;method_name(@args)
    $self-&gt;admin-&gt;method_name(@args);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">These methods only take effect during the <i>initialization</i>
    run, when <i>inc/</i> is being populated; they are ignored for end-users.
    Again, to re-initialize everything, just run <span class="Li">&quot;perl
    Makefile.PL&quot;</span> as the author.</p>
<p class="Pp">Scripts (usually one-liners in <i>Makefile</i>) that wish to
    dispatch <b>AUTOLOAD</b> functions into administrative extensions (instead
    of standard extensions) should use the <b>Module::Install::Admin</b> module
    directly. See Module::Install::Admin for details.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="What_are_the_benefits_of_using_"><a class="permalink" href="#What_are_the_benefits_of_using_">What
  are the benefits of using <b>Module::Install</b>?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Here is a brief overview of the reasons:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Extremely easy for beginners to learn</li>
  <li>Does everything ExtUtils::MakeMaker does.</li>
  <li>Does it with a dramatically simpler syntax.</li>
  <li>Automatically scans for metadata for you.</li>
  <li>Requires no installation for end-users.</li>
  <li>Guaranteed forward-compatibility.</li>
  <li>Automatically updates your MANIFEST.</li>
  <li>Distributing scripts is easy.</li>
  <li>Include prerequisite modules (less dependencies to install)</li>
  <li>Auto-installation of prerequisites.</li>
  <li>Support for Inline-based modules.</li>
  <li>Support for File::ShareDir shared data files</li>
  <li>Support for precompiled PAR binaries.</li>
  <li>Deals with Win32 install issues for you.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">By greatly shrinking and simplifying the syntax,
    <b>Module::Install</b> keeps the amount of work required to maintain your
    <i>Makefile.PL</i> files to an absolute minimum.</p>
<p class="Pp">And if you maintain more than one module than needs to do unusual
    installation tricks, you can create a specific module to abstract away this
    complexity.</p>

  isn't at 1.00 yet, is it safe to use yet?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">As long as you are going to periodically do incremental releases
    to get any bug fixes and new functionality, yes.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you don't plan to do incremental releases, it might be a good
    idea to continue to wait for a while.</p>

<p class="Pp">Implement Module::Install::Compiled and
    Module::Install::Admin::Compiled to integrate the Module::Compiled
    &quot;perl 6 to perl 5&quot; functionality with Module::Install. Because

<p class="Pp">Test recursive Makefile directories</p>
<p class="Pp">The test suite needs a great deal more test scripts.</p>
<p class="Pp">Dependencies on shared libraries (libxml/libxml.dll etc) and
    binary files so that debian/Win32/etc autopackaging applications can create
    the appropriate package-level dependencies there.</p>
