   The definitions below are for supplemental macros used in Tcl/Tk
   manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget.  The
  	options follow on successive lines, in four columns separated
  	by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   RCS: @(#) $Id: man.macros,v 1.1 2009/01/30 04:56:47 andreas_kupries Exp $
  
  	# Set up traps and other miscellaneous stuff for Tcl/Tk man pages.
  	# Start an argument description
  .b
  	# define tabbing values for .AP
  
  	# BS - start boxed text
  	# ^y = starting y location
  	# ^b = 1
  	# BE - end boxed text (draw box now)
  	Draw four-sided box normally, but don't draw top of
  	box if the box started on an earlier page.
  	# VS - start vertical sidebar
  	# ^Y = starting y location
  	# ^v = 1 (for troff;  for nroff this doesn't matter)
  	# VE - end of vertical sidebar
  	# Special macro to handle page bottom:  finish off current
  	# box/sidebar if in box/sidebar mode, then invoked standard
  	# page bottom macro.
  	Draw three-sided box if this is the box's first page,
  	draw two sides but no top otherwise.
  	# DS - begin display
  	# DE - end display
  	# SO - start of list of standard options
  	# SE - end of list of standard options
  	# OP - start of full description for a single option
  	# CS - begin code excerpt
  	# CE - end code excerpt

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>fifo</b></dt>
  <dd>creates a stream-oriented in-memory channel and returns its handle. There
      is no restriction on the ultimate size of the channel, it will always grow
      as much as is necessary to accomodate the data written into it.
    <p class="Pp">In contrast to the channels generated by <b>memchan</b> a
        channel created here effectively represents an U-turn. All data written
        into it can be read out, but only in the same order. This also means
        that a fifo channel is not seekable.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The channels created here can be transfered between
        interpreters in the same thread and between threads, but only as a
        whole. It is not possible to use them to create a bi- or unidirectional
        connection between two interpreters.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Memory channels created by <b>fifo</b> provide two read-only
    options which can be queried via the standard <b>fconfigure</b> command.
    These are</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>-length</dt>
  <dd>The value of this option is the number of bytes currently stored in the
      queried memory channel.</dd>
  <dt>-allocated</dt>
  <dd>The value of this option is the number of bytes currently allocated by the
      queried memory channel. This number is at least as big as the value of
      <i>-length</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">As the channels generated by <b>fifo</b> grow as necessary they
    are always writable. This means that a writable <b>fileevent</b>-handler
    will fire continuously.</p>
<p class="Pp">The channels are also readable if they contain more than zero
    bytes. Under this conditions a readable <b>fileevent</b>-handler will fire
    continuously.</p>

One possible application of memory channels created by <b>memchan</b> or
  <b>fifo</b> is as temporay storage device to collect data coming in over a
  pipe or a socket. If part of the processing of the incoming data is to read
  and process header bytes or similar fifo are easier to use as they do not
  require seeking back and forth to switch between the assimilation of headers
  at the beginning and writing new data at the end.
