   Standard preamble:
   ========================================================================
   Vertical space (when we can't use .PP)
   Begin verbatim text
   End verbatim text
   Set up some character translations and predefined strings.  \*(-- will
   give an unbreakable dash, \*(PI will give pi, \*(L" will give a left
   double quote, and \*(R" will give a right double quote.  \*(C+ will
   give a nicer C++.  Capital omega is used to do unbreakable dashes and
   therefore won't be available.  \*(C` and \*(C' expand to `' in nroff,
   nothing in troff, for use with C<>.

The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a Package may
  be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some semblance of artistic
  control over the development of the package, while giving the users of the
  package the right to use and distribute the Package in a more-or-less
  customary fashion, plus the right to make reasonable modifications.

  <dd>You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this

      distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial)
      programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software distribution
      provided that you do not advertise this Package as a product of your own.

      scripts or library files are aggregated with this Package via the
      so-called &quot;undump&quot; or &quot;unexec&quot; methods of producing a
      binary executable image, then distribution of such an image shall neither
      be construed as a distribution of this Package nor shall it fall under the

      any way that would cause it to fail the regression tests for the
    language.</dd>

  <dd>Aggregation of this Package with a commercial distribution is always
      permitted provided that the use of this Package is embedded; that is, when
