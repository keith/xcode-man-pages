<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<i>zip</i> is a compression and file packaging utility for Unix, VMS, MSDOS,
  OS/2, Windows 9x/NT/XP, Minix, Atari, Macintosh, Amiga, and Acorn RISC OS. It
  is analogous to a combination of the Unix commands <i>tar</i>(1) and
  <i>compress</i>(1) and is compatible with PKZIP (Phil Katz's ZIP for MSDOS
  systems).
<p class="Pp">A companion program (<i>unzip</i>(1L)) unpacks <i>zip</i>
    archives. The <i>zip</i> and <i>unzip</i>(1L) programs can work with
    archives produced by PKZIP (supporting most PKZIP features up to PKZIP
    version 4.6), and PKZIP and PKUNZIP can work with archives produced by
    <i>zip</i> (with some exceptions, notably streamed archives, but recent
    changes in the zip file standard may facilitate better compatibility).
    <i>zip</i> version 3.0 is compatible with PKZIP 2.04 and also supports the
    Zip64 extensions of PKZIP 4.5 which allow archives as well as files to
    exceed the previous 2 GB limit (4 GB in some cases). <i>zip</i> also now
    supports <b>bzip2</b> compression if the <b>bzip2</b> library is included
    when <i>zip</i> is compiled. Note that PKUNZIP 1.10 cannot extract files
    produced by PKZIP 2.04 or <i>zip&#x00A0;3.0</i>. You must use PKUNZIP 2.04g
    or <i>unzip&#x00A0;5.0p1</i> (or later versions) to extract them.</p>
<p class="Pp">See the <b>EXAMPLES</b> section at the bottom of this page for
    examples of some typical uses of <i>zip</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Large&#x00A0;Archives&#x00A0;and&#x00A0;Zip64.</b> <i>zip</i>
    automatically uses the Zip64 extensions when files larger than 4 GB are
    added to an archive, an archive containing Zip64 entries is updated (if the
    resulting archive still needs Zip64), the size of the archive will exceed 4
    GB, or when the number of entries in the archive will exceed about 64K.
    Zip64 is also used for archives streamed from standard input as the size of
    such archives are not known in advance, but the option <b>-fz-</b> can be
    used to force <i>zip</i> to create PKZIP 2 compatible archives (as long as
    Zip64 extensions are not needed). You must use a PKZIP 4.5 compatible unzip,
    such as <i>unzip&#x00A0;6.0</i> or later, to extract files using the Zip64
    extensions.</p>
<p class="Pp">In addition, streamed archives, entries encrypted with standard
    encryption, or split archives created with the pause option may not be
    compatible with PKZIP as data descriptors are used and PKZIP at the time of
    this writing does not support data descriptors (but recent changes in the
    PKWare published zip standard now include some support for the data
    descriptor format <i>zip</i> uses).</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Mac OS X.</b> Though previous Mac versions had their own
    <i>zip</i> port, <i>zip</i> supports Mac OS X as part of the Unix port and
    most Unix features apply. References to &quot;MacOS&quot; below generally
    refer to MacOS versions older than OS X. Support for some Mac OS features in
    the Unix Mac OS X port, such as resource forks, is expected in the next
    <i>zip</i> release.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">For a brief help on <i>zip</i> and <i>unzip</i>, run each without
    specifying any parameters on the command line.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="USE"><a class="permalink" href="#USE">USE</a></h1>
The program is useful for packaging a set of files for distribution; for
  archiving files; and for saving disk space by temporarily compressing unused
  files or directories.
<p class="Pp">The <i>zip</i> program puts one or more compressed files into a
    single <i>zip</i> archive, along with information about the files (name,
    path, date, time of last modification, protection, and check information to
    verify file integrity). An entire directory structure can be packed into a
    <i>zip</i> archive with a single command. Compression ratios of 2:1 to 3:1
    are common for text files. <i>zip</i> has one compression method (deflation)
    and can also store files without compression. (If <b>bzip2</b> support is
    added, <i>zip</i> can also compress using <b>bzip2</b> compression, but such
    entries require a reasonably modern unzip to decompress. When <b>bzip2</b>
    compression is selected, it replaces deflation as the default method.)
    <i>zip</i> automatically chooses the better of the two (deflation or store
    or, if <b>bzip2</b> is selected, <b>bzip2</b> or store) for each file to be
    compressed.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Command&#x00A0;format.</b> The basic command format is</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd><b>zip</b> options archive inpath inpath ...</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">where <b>archive</b> is a new or existing <i>zip</i> archive and
    <b>inpath</b> is a directory or file path optionally including wildcards.
    When given the name of an existing <i>zip</i> archive, <i>zip</i> will
    replace identically named entries in the <i>zip</i> archive (matching the
    relative names as stored in the archive) or add entries for new names. For
    example, if <i>foo.zip</i> exists and contains <i>foo/file1</i> and
    <i>foo/file2</i>, and the directory <i>foo</i> contains the files
    <i>foo/file1</i> and <i>foo/file3</i>, then:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>zip -r foo.zip foo<b></b></dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">or more concisely</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>zip -r foo foo<b></b></dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">will replace <i>foo/file1</i> in <i>foo.zip</i> and add
    <i>foo/file3</i> to <i>foo.zip</i>. After this, <i>foo.zip</i> contains
    <i>foo/file1</i>, <i>foo/file2</i>, and <i>foo/file3</i>, with
    <i>foo/file2</i> unchanged from before.</p>
<p class="Pp">So if before the zip command is executed <i>foo.zip</i> has:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd> foo/file1 foo/file2</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">and directory foo has:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd> file1 file3<i></i></dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">then <i>foo.zip</i> will have:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd> foo/file1 foo/file2 foo/file3<i></i></dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">where <i>foo/file1</i> is replaced and <i>foo/file3</i> is
  new.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>-@&#x00A0;file&#x00A0;lists.</b> If a file list is specified as
    <b>-@</b> [Not on MacOS], <i>zip</i> takes the list of input files from
    standard input instead of from the command line. For example,</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>zip -@ foo<b></b></dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">will store the files listed one per line on stdin in
    <i>foo.zip</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Under Unix, this option can be used to powerful effect in
    conjunction with the <i>find</i>&#x00A0;(1) command. For example, to archive
    all the C source files in the current directory and its subdirectories:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>find . -name &quot;*.[ch]&quot; -print | zip source -@<i></i></dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">(note that the pattern must be quoted to keep the shell from
    expanding it).</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Streaming&#x00A0;input&#x00A0;and&#x00A0;output.</b> <i>zip</i>
    will also accept a single dash (&quot;-&quot;) as the zip file name, in
    which case it will write the zip file to standard output, allowing the
    output to be piped to another program. For example:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>zip -r - . | dd of=/dev/nrst0 obs=16k<b></b></dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">would write the zip output directly to a tape with the specified
    block size for the purpose of backing up the current directory.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>zip</i> also accepts a single dash (&quot;-&quot;) as the name
    of a file to be compressed, in which case it will read the file from
    standard input, allowing zip to take input from another program. For
    example:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>tar cf - . | zip backup -<b></b></dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">would compress the output of the tar command for the purpose of
    backing up the current directory. This generally produces better compression
    than the previous example using the -r option because <i>zip</i> can take
    advantage of redundancy between files. The backup can be restored using the
    command</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>unzip -p backup | tar xf -<b></b></dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">When no zip file name is given and stdout is not a terminal,
    <i>zip</i> acts as a filter, compressing standard input to standard output.
    For example,</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>tar cf - . | zip | dd of=/dev/nrst0 obs=16k<b></b></dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">is equivalent to</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>tar cf - . | zip - - | dd of=/dev/nrst0 obs=16k<b></b></dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp"><i>zip</i> archives created in this manner can be extracted with
    the program <i>funzip</i> which is provided in the <i>unzip</i> package, or
    by <i>gunzip</i> which is provided in the <i>gzip</i> package (but some
    <i>gunzip</i> may not support this if <i>zip</i> used the Zip64 extensions).
    For example:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd><b>dd if=/dev/nrst0 ibs=16k | funzip | tar xvf -</b></dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The stream can also be saved to a file and <i>unzip</i> used.</p>
<p class="Pp">If Zip64 support for large files and archives is enabled and
    <i>zip</i> is used as a filter, <i>zip</i> creates a Zip64 archive that
    requires a PKZIP 4.5 or later compatible unzip to read it. This is to avoid
    amgibuities in the zip file structure as defined in the current zip standard
    (PKWARE AppNote) where the decision to use Zip64 needs to be made before
    data is written for the entry, but for a stream the size of the data is not
    known at that point. If the data is known to be smaller than 4 GB, the
    option <b>-fz-</b> can be used to prevent use of Zip64, but <i>zip</i> will
    exit with an error if Zip64 was in fact needed. <i>zip&#x00A0;3</i> and
    <i>unzip&#x00A0;6</i> and later can read archives with Zip64 entries. Also,
    <i>zip</i> removes the Zip64 extensions if not needed when archive entries
    are copied (see the <b>-U</b> (<b>--copy</b>) option).</p>
<p class="Pp">When directing the output to another file, note that all options
    should be before the redirection including <b>-x</b>. For example:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd><b>zip archive &quot;*.h&quot; &quot;*.c&quot; -x donotinclude.h orthis.h
      &gt; tofile</b></dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp"><b>Zip&#x00A0;files.</b> When changing an existing <i>zip</i>
    archive, <i>zip</i> will write a temporary file with the new contents, and
    only replace the old one when the process of creating the new version has
    been completed without error.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the name of the <i>zip</i> archive does not contain an
    extension, the extension <b>.zip</b> is added. If the name already contains
    an extension other than <b>.zip</b>, the existing extension is kept
    unchanged. However, split archives (archives split over multiple files)
    require the <b>.zip</b> extension on the last split.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Scanning&#x00A0;and&#x00A0;reading&#x00A0;files.</b> When
    <i>zip</i> starts, it scans for files to process (if needed). If this scan
    takes longer than about 5 seconds, <i>zip</i> will display a &quot;Scanning
    files&quot; message and start displaying progress dots every 2 seconds or
    every so many entries processed, whichever takes longer. If there is more
    than 2 seconds between dots it could indicate that finding each file is
    taking time and could mean a slow network connection for example. (Actually
    the initial file scan is a two-step process where the directory scan is
    followed by a sort and these two steps are separated with a space in the
    dots. If updating an existing archive, a space also appears between the
    existing file scan and the new file scan.) The scanning files dots are not
    controlled by the <b>-ds</b> dot size option, but the dots are turned off by
    the <b>-q</b> quiet option. The <b>-sf</b> show files option can be used to
    scan for files and get the list of files scanned without actually processing
    them.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <i>zip</i> is not able to read a file, it issues a warning but
    continues. See the <b>-MM</b> option below for more on how <i>zip</i>
    handles patterns that are not matched and files that are not readable. If
    some files were skipped, a warning is issued at the end of the zip operation
    noting how many files were read and how many skipped.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Command&#x00A0;modes.</b> <i>zip</i> now supports two distinct
    types of command modes, <b>external</b> and <b>internal</b>. The
    <b>external</b> modes (add, update, and freshen) read files from the file
    system (as well as from an existing archive) while the <b>internal</b> modes
    (delete and copy) operate exclusively on entries in an existing archive.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>add&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;</b></dt>
  <dd>Update existing entries and add new files. If the archive does not exist
      create it. This is the default mode.</dd>
  <dt><b>update&#x00A0;<b>(</b><b>-u</b><b>)</b></b></dt>
  <dd>Update existing entries if newer on the file system and add new files. If
      the archive does not exist issue warning then create a new archive.</dd>
  <dt><b>freshen&#x00A0;<b>(</b><b>-f</b><b>)</b></b></dt>
  <dd>Update existing entries of an archive if newer on the file system. Does
      not add new files to the archive.</dd>
  <dt><b>delete&#x00A0;<b>(</b><b>-d</b><b>)</b></b></dt>
  <dd>Select entries in an existing archive and delete them.</dd>
  <dt><b>copy&#x00A0;<b>(</b><b>-U</b><b>)</b></b></dt>
  <dd>Select entries in an existing archive and copy them to a new archive. This
      new mode is similar to <b>update</b> but command line patterns select
      entries in the existing archive rather than files from the file system and
      it uses the <b>--out</b> option to write the resulting archive to a new
      file rather than update the existing archive, leaving the original archive
      unchanged.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The new File Sync option (<b>-FS</b>) is also considered a new
    mode, though it is similar to <b>update</b>. This mode synchronizes the
    archive with the files on the OS, only replacing files in the archive if the
    file time or size of the OS file is different, adding new files, and
    deleting entries from the archive where there is no matching file. As this
    mode can delete entries from the archive, consider making a backup copy of
    the archive.</p>
<p class="Pp">Also see <b>-DF</b> for creating difference archives.</p>
<p class="Pp">See each option description below for details and the
    <b>EXAMPLES</b> section below for examples.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Split&#x00A0;archives.</b> <i>zip</i> version 3.0 and later can
    create split archives. A <b>split archive</b> is a standard zip archive
    split over multiple files. (Note that split archives are not just archives
    split in to pieces, as the offsets of entries are now based on the start of
    each split. Concatenating the pieces together will invalidate these offsets,
    but <i>unzip</i> can usually deal with it. <i>zip</i> will usually refuse to
    process such a spliced archive unless the <b>-FF</b> fix option is used to
    fix the offsets.)</p>
<p class="Pp">One use of split archives is storing a large archive on multiple
    removable media. For a split archive with 20 split files the files are
    typically named (replace ARCHIVE with the name of your archive) ARCHIVE.z01,
    ARCHIVE.z02, ..., ARCHIVE.z19, ARCHIVE.zip. Note that the last file is the
    <b>.zip</b> file. In contrast, <b>spanned archives</b> are the original
    multi-disk archive generally requiring floppy disks and using volume labels
    to store disk numbers. <i>zip</i> supports split archives but not spanned
    archives, though a procedure exists for converting split archives of the
    right size to spanned archives. The reverse is also true, where each file of
    a spanned archive can be copied in order to files with the above names to
    create a split archive.</p>
<p class="Pp">Use <b>-s</b> to set the split size and create a split archive.
    The size is given as a number followed optionally by one of k (kB), m (MB),
    g (GB), or t (TB) (the default is m). The <b>-sp</b> option can be used to
    pause <i>zip</i> between splits to allow changing removable media, for
    example, but read the descriptions and warnings for both <b>-s</b> and
    <b>-sp</b> below.</p>
<p class="Pp">Though <i>zip</i> does not update split archives, <i>zip</i>
    provides the new option <b>-O</b> (<b>--output-file</b> or <b>--out</b>) to
    allow split archives to be updated and saved in a new archive. For
  example,</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>zip inarchive.zip foo.c bar.c --out outarchive.zip<b></b></dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">reads archive <b>inarchive.zip</b>, even if split, adds the files
    <b>foo.c</b> and <b>bar.c</b>, and writes the resulting archive to
    <b>outarchive.zip</b>. If <b>inarchive.zip</b> is split then
    <b>outarchive.zip</b> defaults to the same split size. Be aware that if
    <b>outarchive.zip</b> and any split files that are created with it already
    exist, these are always overwritten as needed without warning. This may be
    changed in the future.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Unicode.</b> Though the zip standard requires storing paths in
    an archive using a specific character set, in practice zips have stored
    paths in archives in whatever the local character set is. This creates
    problems when an archive is created or updated on a system using one
    character set and then extracted on another system using a different
    character set. When compiled with Unicode support enabled on platforms that
    support wide characters, <i>zip</i> now stores, in addition to the standard
    local path for backward compatibility, the UTF-8 translation of the path.
    This provides a common universal character set for storing paths that allows
    these paths to be fully extracted on other systems that support Unicode and
    to match as close as possible on systems that don't.</p>
<p class="Pp">On Win32 systems where paths are internally stored as Unicode but
    represented in the local character set, it's possible that some paths will
    be skipped during a local character set directory scan. <i>zip</i> with
    Unicode support now can read and store these paths. Note that Win 9x systems
    and FAT file systems don't fully support Unicode.</p>
<p class="Pp">Be aware that console windows on Win32 and Unix, for example,
    sometimes don't accurately show all characters due to how each operating
    system switches in character sets for display. However, directory navigation
    tools should show the correct paths if the needed fonts are loaded.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Command line format.</b> This version of <i>zip</i> has updated
    command line processing and support for long options.</p>
<p class="Pp">Short options take the form</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>-s[-][s[-]...][value][=value][&#x00A0;value]<b></b></dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">where s is a one or two character short option. A short option
    that takes a value is last in an argument and anything after it is taken as
    the value. If the option can be negated and &quot;-&quot; immediately
    follows the option, the option is negated. Short options can also be given
    as separate arguments</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>-s[-][value][=value][&#x00A0;value]&#x00A0;-s[-][value][=value][&#x00A0;value]&#x00A0;...<b></b></dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Short options in general take values either as part of the same
    argument or as the following argument. An optional = is also supported.
  So</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>-ttmmddyyyy<b></b></dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">and</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>-tt=mmddyyyy<b></b></dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">and</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>-tt mmddyyyy<b></b></dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">all work. The <b>-x</b> and <b>-i</b> options accept lists of
    values and use a slightly different format described below. See the
    <b>-x</b> and <b>-i</b> options.</p>
<p class="Pp">Long options take the form</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>--longoption[-][=value][ value]<b></b></dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">where the option starts with --, has a multicharacter name, can
    include a trailing dash to negate the option (if the option supports it),
    and can have a value (option argument) specified by preceeding it with = (no
    spaces). Values can also follow the argument. So</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>--before-date=mmddyyyy<b></b></dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">and</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>--before-date mmddyyyy<b></b></dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">both work.</p>
<p class="Pp">Long option names can be shortened to the shortest unique
    abbreviation. See the option descriptions below for which support long
    options. To avoid confusion, avoid abbreviating a negatable option with an
    embedded dash (&quot;-&quot;) at the dash if you plan to negate it (the
    parser would consider a trailing dash, such as for the option
    <b>--some-option</b> using <b>--some-</b> as the option, as part of the name
    rather than a negating dash). This may be changed to force the last dash in
    <b>--some-</b> to be negating in the future.</p>

  <dd>Adjust self-extracting executable archive. A self-extracting executable
      archive is created by prepending the SFX stub to an existing archive. The
      <b>-A</b> option tells <i>zip</i> to adjust the entry offsets stored in
      the archive to take into account this &quot;preamble&quot; data.</dd>

<p class="Pp">Note: self-extracting archives for the Amiga are a special case.
    At present, only the Amiga port of <i>zip</i> is capable of adjusting or

  <dt><b>--archive-clear</b></dt>
  <dd>[WIN32] Once archive is created (and tested if <b>-T</b> is used, which is
      recommended), clear the archive bits of files processed. WARNING: Once the
      bits are cleared they are cleared. You may want to use the <b>-sf</b> show
      files option to store the list of files processed in case the archive
      operation must be repeated. Also consider using the <b>-MM</b> must match
      option. Be sure to check out <b>-DF</b> as a possibly better way to do

  <dd>[WIN32] Only include files that have the archive bit set. Directories are

      entries, including directories, are stored as usual and can be used by
      most unzips to recreate directories.
    <p class="Pp">The archive bit is set by the operating system when a file is
        modified and, if used with <b>-AC</b>, <b>-AS</b> can provide an
        incremental backup capability. However, other applications can modify
        the archive bit and it may not be a reliable indicator of which files
        have changed since the last archive operation. Alternative ways to
        create incremental backups are using <b>-t</b> to use file dates, though
        this won't catch old files copied to directories being archived, and
        <b>-DF</b> to create a differential archive.</p>

  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Under MSDOS, <b>-d</b> is case sensitive when it matches names in the
      <i>zip</i> archive. This requires that file names be entered in upper case
      if they were zipped by PKZIP on an MSDOS system. (We considered making
      this case insensitive on systems where paths were case insensitive, but it
      is possible the archive came from a system where case does matter and the
      archive could include both <b>Bar</b> and <b>bar</b> as separate files in
      the archive.) But see the new option <b>-ic</b> to ignore case in the
      archive.

</dl>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">

  <dd>The reasons behind this are somewhat subtle but have to do with the
      differences between the Unix-format file times (always in GMT) and most of

      with automatic adjustment for ``summertime'' or Daylight Savings
    Time).</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>The format is TTThhDDD, where TTT is the time zone such as MET, hh is the

  <dd>[Unix] Normally <i>zip</i> skips reading any FIFOs (named pipes)

  <dd>Synchronize the contents of an archive with the files on the OS. Normally
      when an archive is updated, new files are added and changed files are
      updated but files that no longer exist on the OS are not deleted from the
      archive. This option enables a new mode that checks entries in the archive
      against the file system. If the file time and file size of the entry
      matches that of the OS file, the entry is copied from the old archive
      instead of being read from the file system and compressed. If the OS file
      has changed, the entry is read and compressed as usual. If the entry in
      the archive does not match a file on the OS, the entry is deleted.
      Enabling this option should create archives that are the same as new
      archives, but since existing entries are copied instead of compressed,
      updating an existing archive with <b>-FS</b> can be much faster than
      creating a new archive. Also consider using <b>-u</b> for updating an

      now off by default for Windows so &quot;[&quot; and &quot;]&quot; are just
      normal characters in names. This option enables [] matching again.

  <dt><b>-s&#x00A0;<i>splitsize</i></b></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>--split-size&#x00A0;<i>splitsize</i></b></dt>
  <dd>Enable creating a split archive and set the split size. A split archive is
      an archive that could be split over many files. As the archive is created,
      if the size of the archive reaches the specified split size, that split is
      closed and the next split opened. In general all splits but the last will
      be the split size and the last will be whatever is left. If the entire
      archive is smaller than the split size a single-file archive is created.
    <p class="Pp">Split archives are stored in numbered files. For example, if
        the output archive is named <b>archive</b> and three splits are
        required, the resulting archive will be in the three files
        <b>archive.z01</b>, <b>archive.z02</b>, and <b>archive.zip</b>. Do not
        change the numbering of these files or the archive will not be readable
        as these are used to determine the order the splits are read.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Split size is a number optionally followed by a multiplier.
        Currently the number must be an integer. The multiplier can currently be
        one of <b>k</b> (kilobytes), <b>m</b> (megabytes), <b>g</b> (gigabytes),
        or <b>t</b> (terabytes). As 64k is the minimum split size, numbers
        without multipliers default to megabytes. For example, to create a split
        archive called <b>foo</b> with the contents of the <b>bar</b> directory
        with splits of 670 MB that might be useful for burning on CDs, the
        command:</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>zip -s 670m -r foo bar</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>could be used.
    <p class="Pp">Currently the old splits of a split archive are not excluded
        from a new archive, but they can be specifically excluded. If possible,
        keep the input and output archives out of the path being zipped when
        creating split archives.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Using <b>-s</b> without <b>-sp</b> as above creates all the
        splits where <b>foo</b> is being written, in this case the current
        directory. This split mode updates the splits as the archive is being
        created, requiring all splits to remain writable, but creates split
        archives that are readable by any unzip that supports split archives.
        See <b>-sp</b> below for enabling split pause mode which allows splits
        to be written directly to removable media.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The option <b>-sv</b> can be used to enable verbose splitting
        and provide details of how the splitting is being done. The <b>-sb</b>
        option can be used to ring the bell when <i>zip</i> pauses for the next
        split destination.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Split archives cannot be updated, but see the <b>-O</b>
        (<b>--out</b>) option for how a split archive can be updated as it is
        copied to a new archive. A split archive can also be converted into a
        single-file archive using a split size of 0 or negating the <b>-s</b>
        option:</p>

      go with the option go with it. This option displays the command line as

      the option can be negated, and a small description. The value format can
      be no value, required value, optional value, single character value,
      number value, or a list of values. The output of this option is not
      intended to show how to use any option but only show what options are

  <dt><b>--split-pause</b></dt>
  <dd>If splitting is enabled with <b>-s</b>, enable split pause mode. This

      each split can be closed as soon as it is written and <i>zip</i> will
      pause between each split to allow changing split destination or media.
    <p class="Pp">Though this split mode allows writing splits directly to
        removable media, it uses stream archive format that may not be readable
        by some unzips. Before relying on splits created with <b>-sp</b>, test a
        split archive with the unzip you will be using.</p>
    <p class="Pp">To convert a stream split archive (created with <b>-sp</b>) to
        a standard archive see the <b>--out</b> option.</p>

      ASCII. When an entry is missing the Unicode path, <i>zip</i> reverts back
      to the standard file path. The problem with using the standard path is
      this path is in the local character set of the zip that created the entry,
      which may contain characters that are not valid in the character set being
      used by the unzip. When <i>zip</i> is reading an archive, if an entry also

  <dd>Do not save extra file attributes (Extended Attributes on OS/2, uid/gid

      additional information for each entry. Some extra fields are specific to
      particular systems while others are applicable to all systems. Normally
      when <i>zip</i> reads entries from an existing archive, it reads the extra
      fields it knows, strips the rest, and adds the extra fields applicable to
      that system. With <b>-X</b>, <i>zip</i> strips all old fields and only
      includes the Unicode and Zip64 extra fields (currently these two extra

  <dd>Set the default compression method. Currently the main methods supported

      be set to:
    <p class="Pp"><b>store</b> - Setting the compression method to <b>store</b>
        forces <i>zip</i> to store entries with no compression. This is
        generally faster than compressing entries, but results in no space
        savings. This is the same as using <b>-0</b> (compression level
      zero).</p>
    <p class="Pp"><b>deflate</b> - This is the default method for <i>zip</i>. If
        <i>zip</i> determines that storing is better than deflation, the entry
        will be stored instead.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><b>bzip2</b> - If <b>bzip2</b> support is compiled in, this
        compression method also becomes available. Only some modern unzips
        currently support the <b>bzip2</b> compression method, so test the unzip
        you will be using before relying on archives using this method
        (compression method 12).</p>

  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>(-0, -1, -2, -3, -4, -5, -6, -7, -8, -9)</b></dt>

      indicates the slowest compression speed (optimal compression, ignores the

The simplest example:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>zip stuff *<b></b></dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">creates the archive <i>stuff.zip</i> (assuming it does not exist)
    and puts all the files in the current directory in it, in compressed form
    (the <b>.zip</b> suffix is added automatically, unless the archive name
    contains a dot already; this allows the explicit specification of other
    suffixes).</p>
<p class="Pp">Because of the way the shell on Unix does filename substitution,
    files starting with &quot;.&quot; are not included; to include these as
    well:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>zip stuff .* *<b></b></dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Even this will not include any subdirectories from the current
    directory.</p>
<p class="Pp">To zip up an entire directory, the command:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>zip -r foo foo<b></b></dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">creates the archive <i>foo.zip</i>, containing all the files and
    directories in the directory <i>foo</i> that is contained within the current
    directory.</p>
<p class="Pp">You may want to make a <i>zip</i> archive that contains the files
    in <i>foo</i>, without recording the directory name, <i>foo</i>. You can use
    the <b>-j</b> option to leave off the paths, as in:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>zip -j foo foo/*<b></b></dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">If you are short on disk space, you might not have enough room to
    hold both the original directory and the corresponding compressed <i>zip</i>
    archive. In this case, you can create the archive in steps using the
    <b>-m</b> option. If <i>foo</i> contains the subdirectories <i>tom</i>,
    <i>dick</i>, and <i>harry</i>, you can:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>zip -rm foo foo/tom<b></b>
    <br/>
    zip -rm foo foo/dick<b></b>
    <br/>
    zip -rm foo foo/harry<b></b></dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">where the first command creates <i>foo.zip</i>, and the next two
    add to it. At the completion of each <i>zip</i> command, the last created
    archive is deleted, making room for the next <i>zip</i> command to
  function.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">Use <b>-s</b> to set the split size and create a split archive.
    The size is given as a number followed optionally by one of k (kB), m (MB),
    g (GB), or t (TB). The command</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>zip -s 2g -r split.zip foo<b></b></dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">creates a split archive of the directory foo with splits no bigger
    than 2&#x00A0;GB each. If foo contained 5&#x00A0;GB of contents and the
    contents were stored in the split archive without compression (to make this
    example simple), this would create three splits, split.z01 at 2&#x00A0;GB,
    split.z02 at 2&#x00A0;GB, and split.zip at a little over 1&#x00A0;GB.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>-sp</b> option can be used to pause <i>zip</i> between
    splits to allow changing removable media, for example, but read the
    descriptions and warnings for both <b>-s</b> and <b>-sp</b> below.</p>
<p class="Pp">Though <i>zip</i> does not update split archives, <i>zip</i>
    provides the new option <b>-O</b> (<b>--output-file</b>) to allow split
    archives to be updated and saved in a new archive. For example,</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>zip inarchive.zip foo.c bar.c --out outarchive.zip<b></b></dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">reads archive <b>inarchive.zip</b>, even if split, adds the files
    <b>foo.c</b> and <b>bar.c</b>, and writes the resulting archive to
    <b>outarchive.zip</b>. If <b>inarchive.zip</b> is split then
    <b>outarchive.zip</b> defaults to the same split size. Be aware that
    <b>outarchive.zip</b> and any split files that are created with it are
    always overwritten without warning. This may be changed in the future.</p>

  MATCHING</a></h1>
This section applies only to Unix. Watch this space for details on MSDOS and VMS
  operation. However, the special wildcard characters <b>*</b> and <b>[]</b>
  below apply to at least MSDOS also.
<p class="Pp">The Unix shells (<i>sh</i>, <i>csh</i>, <i>bash</i>, and others)
    normally do filename substitution (also called &quot;globbing&quot;) on
    command arguments. Generally the special characters are:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>?</b></dt>
  <dd>match any single character</dd>
  <dt><b>*</b></dt>
  <dd>match any number of characters (including none)</dd>
  <dt><b>[]</b></dt>
  <dd>match any character in the range indicated within the brackets (example:
      [a-f], [0-9]). This form of wildcard matching allows a user to specify a
      list of characters between square brackets and if any of the characters
      match the expression matches. For example:</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>zip archive &quot;*.[hc]&quot;<i></i></dd>
</dl>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>would archive all files in the current directory that end in <b>.h</b> or
      <b>.c</b>.
    <p class="Pp">Ranges of characters are supported:</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>zip archive &quot;[a-f]*&quot;<b></b></dd>
</dl>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>would add to the archive all files starting with &quot;a&quot; through
      &quot;f&quot;.
    <p class="Pp">Negation is also supported, where any character in that
        position not in the list matches. Negation is supported by adding
        <b>!</b> or <b>^</b> to the beginning of the list:</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>zip archive &quot;*.[!o]&quot;<b></b></dd>
</dl>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>matches files that don't end in &quot;.o&quot;.
    <p class="Pp">On WIN32, [] matching needs to be turned on with the -RE
        option to avoid the confusion that names with [ or ] have caused.</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">When these characters are encountered (without being escaped with
    a backslash or quotes), the shell will look for files relative to the
    current path that match the pattern, and replace the argument with a list of
    the names that matched.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>zip</i> program can do the same matching on names that are
    in the <i>zip</i> archive being modified or, in the case of the <b>-x</b>
    (exclude) or <b>-i</b> (include) options, on the list of files to be
    operated on, by using backslashes or quotes to tell the shell not to do the
    name expansion. In general, when <i>zip</i> encounters a name in the list of
    files to do, it first looks for the name in the file system. If it finds it,
    it then adds it to the list of files to do. If it does not find it, it looks
    for the name in the <i>zip</i> archive being modified (if it exists), using
    the pattern matching characters described above, if present. For each match,
    it will add that name to the list of files to be processed, unless this name
    matches one given with the <b>-x</b> option, or does not match any name
    given with the <b>-i</b> option.</p>
<p class="Pp">The pattern matching includes the path, and so patterns like \*.o
    match names that end in &quot;.o&quot;, no matter what the path prefix is.
    Note that the backslash must precede every special character (i.e. ?*[]), or
    the entire argument must be enclosed in double quotes (&quot;&quot;).</p>
<p class="Pp">In general, use backslashes or double quotes for paths that have
    wildcards to make <i>zip</i> do the pattern matching for file paths, and
    always for paths and strings that have spaces or wildcards for <b>-i</b>,
    <b>-x</b>, <b>-R</b>, <b>-d</b>, and <b>-U</b> and anywhere <i>zip</i> needs
    to process the wildcards.</p>

<i>zip</i> 3.0 is not compatible with PKUNZIP 1.10. Use <i>zip</i> 1.1 to
  produce <i>zip</i> files which can be extracted by PKUNZIP 1.10.
<p class="Pp"><i>zip</i> files produced by <i>zip</i> 3.0 must not be
    <i>updated</i> by <i>zip</i> 1.1 or PKZIP 1.10, if they contain encrypted
    members or if they have been produced in a pipe or on a non-seekable device.
    The old versions of <i>zip</i> or PKZIP would create an archive with an
    incorrect format. The old versions can list the contents of the zip file but
    cannot extract it anyway (because of the new compression algorithm). If you
    do not use encryption and use regular disk files, you do not have to care
    about this problem.</p>
<p class="Pp">Under VMS, not all of the odd file formats are treated properly.
    Only stream-LF format <i>zip</i> files are expected to work with <i>zip</i>.
    Others can be converted using Rahul Dhesi's BILF program. This version of
    <i>zip</i> handles some of the conversion internally. When using Kermit to
    transfer zip files from VMS to MSDOS, type &quot;set file type block&quot;
    on VMS. When transfering from MSDOS to VMS, type &quot;set file type
    fixed&quot; on VMS. In both cases, type &quot;set file type binary&quot; on
    MSDOS.</p>
<p class="Pp">Under some older VMS versions, <i>zip</i> may hang for file
    specifications that use DECnet syntax <i>foo::*.*.</i></p>
<p class="Pp">On OS/2, zip cannot match some names, such as those including an
    exclamation mark or a hash sign. This is a bug in OS/2 itself: the 32-bit
    DosFindFirst/Next don't find such names. Other programs such as GNU tar are
    also affected by this bug.</p>
<p class="Pp">Under OS/2, the amount of Extended Attributes displayed by DIR is
    (for compatibility) the amount returned by the 16-bit version of
    DosQueryPathInfo(). Otherwise OS/2 1.3 and 2.0 would report different EA
    sizes when DIRing a file. However, the structure layout returned by the
    32-bit DosQueryPathInfo() is a bit different, it uses extra padding bytes
    and link pointers (it's a linked list) to have all fields on 4-byte
    boundaries for portability to future RISC OS/2 versions. Therefore the value
    reported by <i>zip</i> (which uses this 32-bit-mode size) differs from that
    reported by DIR. <i>zip</i> stores the 32-bit format for portability, even
    the 16-bit MS-C-compiled version running on OS/2 1.3, so even this one shows
    the 32-bit-mode size.</p>

Thanks to R. P. Byrne for his <i>Shrink.Pas</i> program, which inspired this
  project, and from which the shrink algorithm was stolen; to Phil Katz for
  placing in the public domain the <i>zip</i> file format, compression format,
  and .ZIP filename extension, and for accepting minor changes to the file
  format; to Steve Burg for clarifications on the deflate format; to Haruhiko
  Okumura and Leonid Broukhis for providing some useful ideas for the
  compression algorithm; to Keith Petersen, Rich Wales, Hunter Goatley and Mark
  Adler for providing a mailing list and <i>ftp</i> site for the Info-ZIP group
  to use; and most importantly, to the Info-ZIP group itself (listed in the file
  <i>infozip.who</i>) without whose tireless testing and bug-fixing efforts a
  portable <i>zip</i> would not have been possible. Finally we should thank
  (blame) the first Info-ZIP moderator, David Kirschbaum, for getting us into
  this mess in the first place. The manual page was rewritten for Unix by R. P.
  C. Rodgers and updated by E. Gordon for <i>zip</i> 3.0.
