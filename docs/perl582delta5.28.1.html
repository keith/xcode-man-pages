   Set up some character translations and predefined strings.  \*(-- will
   give an unbreakable dash, \*(PI will give pi, \*(L" will give a left
   double quote, and \*(R" will give a right double quote.  \*(C+ will
   give a nicer C++.  Capital omega is used to do unbreakable dashes and
   therefore won't be available.  \*(C` and \*(C' expand to `' in nroff,
   nothing in troff, for use with C<>.

perl582delta - what is new for perl v5.8.2
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
This document describes differences between the 5.8.1 release and the 5.8.2
  release.
<p class="Pp">If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.6.1, first
    read the perl58delta, which describes differences between 5.6.0 and 5.8.0,
    and the perl581delta, which describes differences between 5.8.0 and
  5.8.1.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="Incompatible_Changes"><a class="permalink" href="#Incompatible_Changes">Incompatible
  Changes</a></h1>
For threaded builds for modules calling certain re-entrant system calls, binary
  compatibility was accidentally lost between 5.8.0 and 5.8.1. Binary
  compatibility with 5.8.0 has been restored in 5.8.2, which necessitates
  breaking compatibility with 5.8.1. We see this as the lesser of two evils.
<p class="Pp">This will only affect people who have a threaded perl 5.8.1, and
    compiled modules which use these calls, and now attempt to run the compiled
    modules with 5.8.2. The fix is to re-compile and re-install the modules
    using 5.8.2.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Hash_Randomisation"><a class="permalink" href="#Hash_Randomisation">Hash
  Randomisation</a></h2>
The hash randomisation introduced with 5.8.1 has been amended. It transpired
  that although the implementation introduced in 5.8.1 was source compatible
  with 5.8.0, it was not binary compatible in certain cases. 5.8.2 contains an
  improved implementation which is both source and binary compatible with both
  5.8.0 and 5.8.1, and remains robust against the form of attack which prompted
  the change for 5.8.1.
<p class="Pp">We are grateful to the Debian project for their input in this
    area. See &quot;Algorithmic Complexity Attacks&quot; in perlsec for the
    original rationale behind this change.</p>

Interpreter initialization is more complete when -DMULTIPLICITY is off. This
  should resolve problems with initializing and destroying the Perl interpreter
  more than once in a single process.

Dynamic linker flags have been tweaked for Solaris and OS X, which should solve

  Directions</a></h1>
Starting with 5.8.3 we intend to make more frequent maintenance releases, with a
  smaller number of changes in each. The intent is to propagate bug fixes out to
  stable releases more rapidly and make upgrading stable releases less of an
  upheaval. This should give end users more flexibility in their choice of
  upgrade timing, and allow them easier assessment of the impact of upgrades.
  The current plan is for code freezes as follows
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>5.8.3 23:59:59 GMT, Wednesday December 31st 2003</li>
  <li>5.8.4 23:59:59 GMT, Wednesday March 31st 2004</li>
  <li>5.8.5 23:59:59 GMT, Wednesday June 30th 2004</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">with the release following soon after, when testing is
  complete.</p>

  Bugs</a></h1>
If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
  posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
  http://bugs.perl.org/. There may also be information at http://www.perl.com/,
  the Perl Home Page.
<p class="Pp">If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the
    <b>perlbug</b> program included with your release. Be sure to trim your bug
    down to a tiny but sufficient test case. Your bug report, along with the
    output of <span class="Li">&quot;perl -V&quot;</span>, will be sent off to
    perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team. You can browse and
    search the Perl 5 bugs at http://bugs.perl.org/</p>
