This manual describes the convention used throughout Git CLI.
<p class="Pp">Many commands take revisions (most often &quot;commits&quot;, but
    sometimes &quot;tree-ish&quot;, depending on the context and command) and
    paths as their arguments. Here are the rules:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Revisions come first and then paths. E.g. in
  <b>git diff v1.0 v2.0 arch/x86 include/asm-x86</b>, <b>v1.0</b> and
  <b>v2.0</b> are revisions and <b>arch/x86</b> and <b>include/asm-x86</b> are
  paths.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;When an argument can be misunderstood as either a
  revision or a path, they can be disambiguated by placing <b>--</b> between
  them. E.g. <b>git diff -- HEAD</b> is, &quot;I have a file called HEAD in my
  work tree. Please show changes between the version I staged in the index and
  what I have in the work tree for that file&quot;, not &quot;show difference
  between the HEAD commit and the work tree as a whole&quot;. You can say <b>git
  diff HEAD --</b> to ask for the latter.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Without disambiguating <b>--</b>, Git makes a
  reasonable guess, but errors out and asking you to disambiguate when
  ambiguous. E.g. if you have a file called HEAD in your work tree, <b>git diff
  HEAD</b> is ambiguous, and you have to say either <b>git diff HEAD --</b> or
  <b>git diff -- HEAD</b> to disambiguate.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Because <b>--</b> disambiguates revisions and
  paths in some commands, it cannot be used for those commands to separate
  options and revisions. You can use <b>--end-of-options</b> for this (it also
  works for commands that do not distinguish between revisions in paths, in
  which case it is simply an alias for <b>--</b>).
<p class="Pp">When writing a script that is expected to handle random
    user-input, it is a good practice to make it explicit which arguments are
    which by placing disambiguating <b>--</b> at appropriate places.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Many commands allow wildcards in paths, but you
  need to protect them from getting globbed by the shell. These two mean
  different things:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ git restore *.c
$ git restore \*.c
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The former lets your shell expand the fileglob, and you are asking
    the dot-C files in your working tree to be overwritten with the version in
    the index. The latter passes the <b>*.c</b> to Git, and you are asking the
    paths in the index that match the pattern to be checked out to your working
    tree. After running <b>git add hello.c; rm hello.c</b>, you will <i>not</i>
    see <b>hello.c</b> in your working tree with the former, but with the latter
    you will.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Just as the filesystem <i>.</i> (period) refers
  to the current directory, using a <i>.</i> as a repository name in Git (a
  dot-repository) is a relative path and means your current repository.</div>
<p class="Pp">Here are the rules regarding the &quot;flags&quot; that you should
    follow when you are scripting Git:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;it&#x2019;s preferred to use the non-dashed form
  of Git commands, which means that you should prefer <b>git foo</b> to
  <b>git-foo</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;splitting short options to separate words (prefer
  <b>git foo -a -b</b> to <b>git foo -ab</b>, the latter may not even
  work).</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;when a command-line option takes an argument, use
  the <i>stuck</i> form. In other words, write <b>git foo -oArg</b> instead of
  <b>git foo -o Arg</b> for short options, and <b>git foo --long-opt=Arg</b>
  instead of <b>git foo --long-opt Arg</b> for long options. An option that
  takes optional option-argument must be written in the <i>stuck</i> form.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;when you give a revision parameter to a command,
  make sure the parameter is not ambiguous with a name of a file in the work
  tree. E.g. do not write <b>git log -1 HEAD</b> but write <b>git log -1 HEAD
  --</b>; the former will not work if you happen to have a file called
  <b>HEAD</b> in the work tree.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;many commands allow a long option <b>--option</b>
  to be abbreviated only to their unique prefix (e.g. if there is no other
  option whose name begins with <b>opt</b>, you may be able to spell
  <b>--opt</b> to invoke the <b>--option</b> flag), but you should fully spell
  them out when writing your scripts; later versions of Git may introduce a new
  option whose name shares the same prefix, e.g. <b>--optimize</b>, to make a
  short prefix that used to be unique no longer unique.</div>

<h1 class="Sh" id="ENHANCED_OPTION_PARSER"><a class="permalink" href="#ENHANCED_OPTION_PARSER">ENHANCED
  OPTION PARSER</a></h1>
From the Git 1.5.4 series and further, many Git commands (not all of them at the
  time of the writing though) come with an enhanced option parser.
<p class="Pp">Here is a list of the facilities provided by this option
  parser.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Magic_Options"><a class="permalink" href="#Magic_Options">Magic
  Options</a></h2>
Commands which have the enhanced option parser activated all understand a couple
  of magic command-line options:
<p class="Pp">-h</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">gives a pretty printed usage of the command.
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ git describe -h
usage: git describe [&lt;options&gt;] &lt;commit-ish&gt;*
   or: git describe [&lt;options&gt;] --dirty
    --contains            find the tag that comes after the commit
    --debug               debug search strategy on stderr
    --all                 use any ref
    --tags                use any tag, even unannotated
    --long                always use long format
    --abbrev[=&lt;n&gt;]        use &lt;n&gt; digits to display SHA-1s
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--help-all</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Some Git commands take options that are only used for
  plumbing or that are deprecated, and such options are hidden from the default
  usage. This option gives the full list of options.</div>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Negating_options"><a class="permalink" href="#Negating_options">Negating
  options</a></h2>
Options with long option names can be negated by prefixing <b>--no-</b>. For
  example, <b>git branch</b> has the option <b>--track</b> which is <i>on</i> by
  default. You can use <b>--no-track</b> to override that behaviour. The same
  goes for <b>--color</b> and <b>--no-color</b>.
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Aggregating_short_options"><a class="permalink" href="#Aggregating_short_options">Aggregating
  short options</a></h2>
Commands that support the enhanced option parser allow you to aggregate short
  options. This means that you can for example use <b>git rm -rf</b> or <b>git
  clean -fdx</b>.
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Abbreviating_long_options"><a class="permalink" href="#Abbreviating_long_options">Abbreviating
  long options</a></h2>
Commands that support the enhanced option parser accepts unique prefix of a long
  option as if it is fully spelled out, but use this with a caution. For
  example, <b>git commit --amen</b> behaves as if you typed <b>git commit
  --amend</b>, but that is true only until a later version of Git introduces
  another option that shares the same prefix, e.g. <b>git commit --amenity</b>
  option.
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Separating_argument_from_the_option"><a class="permalink" href="#Separating_argument_from_the_option">Separating
  argument from the option</a></h2>
You can write the mandatory option parameter to an option as a separate word on
  the command line. That means that all the following uses work:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ git foo --long-opt=Arg
$ git foo --long-opt Arg
$ git foo -oArg
$ git foo -o Arg
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">However, this is <b>NOT</b> allowed for switches with an optional
    value, where the <i>stuck</i> form must be used:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ git describe --abbrev HEAD     # correct
$ git describe --abbrev=10 HEAD  # correct
$ git describe --abbrev 10 HEAD  # NOT WHAT YOU MEANT
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="NOTES_ON_FREQUENTLY_CONFUSED_OPTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#NOTES_ON_FREQUENTLY_CONFUSED_OPTIONS">NOTES
  ON FREQUENTLY CONFUSED OPTIONS</a></h1>
Many commands that can work on files in the working tree and/or in the index can
  take <b>--cached</b> and/or <b>--index</b> options. Sometimes people
  incorrectly think that, because the index was originally called cache, these
  two are synonyms. They are <b>not</b> &#x2014; these two options mean very
  different things.
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;The <b>--cached</b> option is used to ask a
  command that usually works on files in the working tree to <b>only</b> work
  with the index. For example, <b>git grep</b>, when used without a commit to
  specify from which commit to look for strings in, usually works on files in
  the working tree, but with the <b>--cached</b> option, it looks for strings in
  the index.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;The <b>--index</b> option is used to ask a
  command that usually works on files in the working tree to <b>also</b> affect
  the index. For example, <b>git stash apply</b> usually merges changes recorded
  in a stash entry to the working tree, but with the <b>--index</b> option, it
  also merges changes to the index as well.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>git apply</b> command can be used with <b>--cached</b> and
    <b>--index</b> (but not at the same time). Usually the command only affects
    the files in the working tree, but with <b>--index</b>, it patches both the
    files and their index entries, and with <b>--cached</b>, it modifies only
    the index entries.</p>
<p class="Pp">See also <b>http://marc.info/?l=git&amp;m=116563135620359</b> and
    <b>http://marc.info/?l=git&amp;m=119150393620273</b> for further
    information.</p>
<p class="Pp">Some other commands that also work on files in the working tree
    and/or in the index can take <b>--staged</b> and/or <b>--worktree</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>--staged</b> is exactly like <b>--cached</b>,
  which is used to ask a command to only work on the index, not the working
  tree.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>--worktree</b> is the opposite, to ask a
  command to work on the working tree only, not the index.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;The two options can be specified together to ask
  a command to work on both the index and the working tree.</div>
