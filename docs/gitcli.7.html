<p class="Pp">This manual describes the convention used throughout Git CLI.</p>
<p class="Pp">Many commands take revisions (most often &quot;commits&quot;, but
    sometimes &quot;tree-ish&quot;, depending on the context and command) and
    paths as their arguments. Here are the rules:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Options come first and then args. A subcommand
  may take dashed options (which may take their own arguments, e.g.
  &quot;--max-parents 2&quot;) and arguments. You SHOULD give dashed options
  first and then arguments. Some commands may accept dashed options after you
  have already given non-option arguments (which may make the command
  ambiguous), but you should not rely on it (because eventually we may find a
  way to fix these ambiguities by enforcing the &quot;options then args&quot;
  rule).</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Revisions come first and then paths. E.g. in
  <b>git</b> <b>diff</b> <b>v1.0</b> <b>v2.0</b> <b>arch/x86</b>
  <b>include/asm-x86</b>, <b>v1.0</b> and <b>v2.0</b> are revisions and
  <b>arch/x86</b> and <b>include/asm-x86</b> are paths.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;When an argument can be misunderstood as either a
  revision or a path, they can be disambiguated by placing <b>--</b> between
  them. E.g. <b>git</b> <b>diff</b> <b>--</b> <b>HEAD</b> is, &quot;I have a
  file called HEAD in my work tree. Please show changes between the version I
  staged in the index and what I have in the work tree for that file&quot;, not
  &quot;show the difference between the HEAD commit and the work tree as a
  whole&quot;. You can say <b>git</b> <b>diff</b> <b>HEAD</b> <b>--</b> to ask
  for the latter.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Without disambiguating <b>--</b>, Git makes a
  reasonable guess, but errors out and asks you to disambiguate when ambiguous.
  E.g. if you have a file called HEAD in your work tree, <b>git</b> <b>diff</b>
  <b>HEAD</b> is ambiguous, and you have to say either <b>git</b> <b>diff</b>
  <b>HEAD</b> <b>--</b> or <b>git</b> <b>diff</b> <b>--</b> <b>HEAD</b> to
  disambiguate.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Because <b>--</b> disambiguates revisions and
  paths in some commands, it cannot be used for those commands to separate
  options and revisions. You can use <b>--end-of-options</b> for this (it also
  works for commands that do not distinguish between revisions in paths, in
  which case it is simply an alias for <b>--</b>).
<p class="Pp">When writing a script that is expected to handle random
    user-input, it is a good practice to make it explicit which arguments are
    which by placing disambiguating <b>--</b> at appropriate places.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Many commands allow wildcards in paths, but you
  need to protect them from getting globbed by the shell. These two mean
  different things:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ git restore *.c
$ git restore \*.c</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The former lets your shell expand the fileglob, and you are asking
    the dot-C files in your working tree to be overwritten with the version in
    the index. The latter passes the <b>*.c</b> to Git, and you are asking the
    paths in the index that match the pattern to be checked out to your working
    tree. After running <b>git</b> <b>add</b> <b>hello.c</b>; <b>rm</b>
    <b>hello.c</b>, you will <i>not</i> see <b>hello.c</b> in your working tree
    with the former, but with the latter you will.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Just as the filesystem <i>.</i> (period) refers
  to the current directory, using a <i>.</i> as a repository name in Git (a
  dot-repository) is a relative path and means your current repository.</div>
<p class="Pp">Here are the rules regarding the &quot;flags&quot; that you should
    follow when you are scripting Git:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Splitting short options to separate words (prefer
  <b>git</b> <b>foo</b> <b>-a</b> <b>-b</b> to <b>git</b> <b>foo</b> <b>-ab</b>,
  the latter may not even work).</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;When a command-line option takes an argument, use
  the <i>stuck</i> form. In other words, write <b>git</b> <b>foo</b>
  <b>-oArg</b> instead of <b>git</b> <b>foo</b> <b>-o</b> <b>Arg</b> for short
  options, and <b>git</b> <b>foo</b> <b>--long-opt=Arg</b> instead of <b>git</b>
  <b>foo</b> <b>--long-opt</b> <b>Arg</b> for long options. An option that takes
  optional option-argument must be written in the <i>stuck</i> form.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Despite the above suggestion, when Arg is a path
  relative to the home directory of a user, e.g. <b>~/directory/file</b> or
  <b>~u/d/f</b>, you may want to use the separate form, e.g. <b>git</b>
  <b>foo</b> <b>--file</b> <b>~/mine</b>, not <b>git</b> <b>foo</b>
  <b>--file=~/mine</b>. The shell will expand <b>~/</b> in the former to your
  home directory, but most shells keep the tilde in the latter. Some of our
  commands know how to tilde-expand the option value even when given in the
  stuck form, but not all of them do.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;When you give a revision parameter to a command,
  make sure the parameter is not ambiguous with a name of a file in the work
  tree. E.g. do not write <b>git</b> <b>log</b> <b>-1</b> <b>HEAD</b> but write
  <b>git</b> <b>log</b> <b>-1</b> <b>HEAD</b> <b>--</b>; the former will not
  work if you happen to have a file called <b>HEAD</b> in the work tree.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Many commands allow a long option <b>--option</b>
  to be abbreviated only to their unique prefix (e.g. if there is no other
  option whose name begins with <b>opt</b>, you may be able to spell
  <b>--opt</b> to invoke the <b>--option</b> flag), but you should fully spell
  them out when writing your scripts; later versions of Git may introduce a new
  option whose name shares the same prefix, e.g. <b>--optimize</b>, to make a
  short prefix that used to be unique no longer unique.</div>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="ENHANCED_OPTION_PARSER"><a class="permalink" href="#ENHANCED_OPTION_PARSER">ENHANCED
  OPTION PARSER</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">From the Git 1.5.4 series and further, many Git commands (not all
    of them at the time of the writing though) come with an enhanced option
    parser.</p>
<p class="Pp">Here is a list of the facilities provided by this option
  parser.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Magic_Options"><a class="permalink" href="#Magic_Options">Magic
  Options</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Commands which have the enhanced option parser activated all
    understand a couple of magic command-line options:</p>
<p class="Pp">-h</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">gives a pretty printed usage of the command.
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ git describe -h
usage: git describe [&lt;options&gt;] &lt;commit-ish&gt;*
<br/>
   or: git describe [&lt;options&gt;] --dirty
<br/>
    --contains            find the tag that comes after the commit
<br/>
    --debug               debug search strategy on stderr
<br/>
    --all                 use any ref
<br/>
    --tags                use any tag, even unannotated
<br/>
    --long                always use long format
<br/>
    --abbrev[=&lt;n&gt;]        use &lt;n&gt; digits to display SHA-1s</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Note that some subcommand (e.g. <b>git</b> <b>grep</b>) may behave
    differently when there are things on the command line other than <b>-h</b>,
    but <b>git</b> <b>subcmd</b> <b>-h</b> without anything else on the command
    line is meant to consistently give the usage.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--help-all</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Some Git commands take options that are only used for
  plumbing or that are deprecated, and such options are hidden from the default
  usage. This option gives the full list of options.</div>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Negating_options"><a class="permalink" href="#Negating_options">Negating
  options</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Options with long option names can be negated by prefixing
    <b>--no-</b>. For example, <b>git</b> <b>branch</b> has the option
    <b>--track</b> which is <i>on</i> by default. You can use <b>--no-track</b>
    to override that behaviour. The same goes for <b>--color</b> and
    <b>--no-color</b>.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Options_trump_configuration_and_environment"><a class="permalink" href="#Options_trump_configuration_and_environment">Options
  trump configuration and environment</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">When there is a configuration variable or an environment variable
    that tweak the behaviour of an aspect of a Git command, and also a command
    line option that tweaks the same, the command line option overrides what the
    configuration and/or environment variable say.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, the <b>user.name</b> configuration variable is used
    to specify the human-readable name used by the <b>git</b> <b>commit</b>
    command to record the author and the committer name in a newly created
    commit. The <b>GIT_AUTHOR_NAME</b> environment variable, if set, takes
    precedence when deciding what author name to record. The
    <b>--author=</b><i>&lt;author&gt;</i> command line option of the <b>git</b>
    <b>commit</b> command, when given, takes precedence over these two sources
    of information.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Aggregating_short_options"><a class="permalink" href="#Aggregating_short_options">Aggregating
  short options</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Commands that support the enhanced option parser allow you to
    aggregate short options. This means that you can for example use <b>git</b>
    <b>rm</b> <b>-rf</b> or <b>git</b> <b>clean</b> <b>-fdx</b>.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Abbreviating_long_options"><a class="permalink" href="#Abbreviating_long_options">Abbreviating
  long options</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Commands that support the enhanced option parser accepts unique
    prefix of a long option as if it is fully spelled out, but use this with a
    caution. For example, <b>git</b> <b>commit</b> <b>--amen</b> behaves as if
    you typed <b>git</b> <b>commit</b> <b>--amend</b>, but that is true only
    until a later version of Git introduces another option that shares the same
    prefix, e.g. <b>git</b> <b>commit</b> <b>--amenity</b> option.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Separating_argument_from_the_option"><a class="permalink" href="#Separating_argument_from_the_option">Separating
  argument from the option</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">You can write the mandatory option parameter to an option as a
    separate word on the command line. That means that all the following uses
    work:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ git foo --long-opt=Arg
$ git foo --long-opt Arg
$ git foo -oArg
$ git foo -o Arg</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">However, this is <b>NOT</b> allowed for switches with an optional
    value, where the <i>stuck</i> form must be used:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ git describe --abbrev HEAD     # correct
$ git describe --abbrev=10 HEAD  # correct
$ git describe --abbrev 10 HEAD  # NOT WHAT YOU MEANT</pre>
</div>

<h1 class="Sh" id="NOTES_ON_FREQUENTLY_CONFUSED_OPTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#NOTES_ON_FREQUENTLY_CONFUSED_OPTIONS">NOTES
  ON FREQUENTLY CONFUSED OPTIONS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Many commands that can work on files in the working tree and/or in
    the index can take <b>--cached</b> and/or <b>--index</b> options. Sometimes
    people incorrectly think that, because the index was originally called
    cache, these two are synonyms. They are <b>not</b> &#x2014; these two
    options mean very different things.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;The <b>--cached</b> option is used to ask a
  command that usually works on files in the working tree to <b>only</b> work
  with the index. For example, <b>git</b> <b>grep</b>, when used without a
  commit to specify from which commit to look for strings in, usually works on
  files in the working tree, but with the <b>--cached</b> option, it looks for
  strings in the index.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;The <b>--index</b> option is used to ask a
  command that usually works on files in the working tree to <b>also</b> affect
  the index. For example, <b>git</b> <b>stash</b> <b>apply</b> usually merges
  changes recorded in a stash entry to the working tree, but with the
  <b>--index</b> option, it also merges changes to the index as well.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>git</b> <b>apply</b> command can be used with <b>--cached</b>
    and <b>--index</b> (but not at the same time). Usually the command only
    affects the files in the working tree, but with <b>--index</b>, it patches
    both the files and their index entries, and with <b>--cached</b>, it
    modifies only the index entries.</p>
<p class="Pp">See also
    <b>https://lore.kernel.org/git/7v64clg5u9.fsf@assigned-by-dhcp.cox.net/</b>
    and
    <b>https://lore.kernel.org/git/7vy7ej9g38.fsf@gitster.siamese.dyndns.org/</b>
    for further information.</p>
<p class="Pp">Some other commands that also work on files in the working tree
    and/or in the index can take <b>--staged</b> and/or <b>--worktree</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>--staged</b> is exactly like <b>--cached</b>,
  which is used to ask a command to only work on the index, not the working
  tree.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>--worktree</b> is the opposite, to ask a
  command to work on the working tree only, not the index.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;The two options can be specified together to ask
  a command to work on both the index and the working tree.</div>
