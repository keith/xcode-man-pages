   double quote, and \*(R" will give a right double quote.  \*(C+ will
   give a nicer C++.  Capital omega is used to do unbreakable dashes and

Using a lookbehind assertion (like
  <span class="Li">&quot;(?&lt;=foo?)&quot;</span> or
  <span class="Li">&quot;(?&lt;!ba{1,9}r)&quot;</span> previously would generate
  an error and refuse to compile. Now it compiles (if the maximum lookbehind is
  at most 255 characters), but raises a warning in the new
  <span class="Li">&quot;experimental::vlb&quot;</span> warnings category. This
  is to caution you that the precise behavior is subject to change based on
  feedback from use in the field.

<h2 class="Ss" id="Unicode_12.1_is_supported"><a class="permalink" href="#Unicode_12.1_is_supported">Unicode
  12.1 is supported</a></h2>
Because of a change in Unicode release cycles, Perl jumps from Unicode 10.0 in
  Perl 5.28 to Unicode 12.1 in Perl 5.30.
<p class="Pp">For details on the Unicode changes, see
    &lt;https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode11.0.0/&gt; for 11.0;
    &lt;https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode12.0.0/&gt; for 12.0; and
    &lt;https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode12.1.0/&gt; for 12.1. (Unicode
    12.1 differs from 12.0 only in the addition of a single character, that for
    the new Japanese era name.)</p>
<p class="Pp">The Word_Break property, as in past Perl releases, remains
    tailored to behave more in line with expectations of Perl users. This means
    that sequential runs of horizontal white space characters are not broken
    apart, but kept as a single run. Unicode 11 changed from past versions to be
    more in line with Perl, but it left several white space characters as
    causing breaks: TAB, NO BREAK SPACE, and FIGURE SPACE (U+2007). We have
    decided to continue to use the previous Perl tailoring with regards to
    these.</p>

  in Unicode property value specifications are now partially supported</a></h2>
You can now do something like this in a regular expression pattern
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
 qr! \p{nv= /(?x) \A [0-5] \z / }!
</pre>
<p class="Pp">which matches all Unicode code points whose numeric value is
    between 0 and 5 inclusive. So, it could match the Thai or Bengali digits
    whose numeric values are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.</p>
<p class="Pp">This marks another step in implementing the regular expression
    features the Unicode Consortium suggests.</p>
<p class="Pp">Most properties are supported, with the remainder planned for
    5.32. Details are in &quot;Wildcards in Property Values&quot; in
    perlunicode.</p>

  UTF-8 locales are now seamlessly supported</a></h2>
Turkic languages have different casing rules than other languages for the
  characters <span class="Li">&quot;i&quot;</span> and
  <span class="Li">&quot;I&quot;</span>. The uppercase of
  <span class="Li">&quot;i&quot;</span> is LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I WITH DOT ABOVE
  (U+0130); and the lowercase of <span class="Li">&quot;I&quot;</span> is LATIN
  SMALL LETTER DOTLESS I (U+0131). Unicode furnishes alternate casing rules for
  use with Turkic languages. Previously, Perl ignored these, but now, it uses
  them when it detects that it is operating under a Turkic UTF-8 locale.

The following modules will be removed from the core distribution in a future
  release, and will at that time need to be installed from CPAN. Distributions
  on CPAN which require these modules will need to list them as prerequisites.
<p class="Pp">The core versions of these modules will now issue

<p class="Pp">Note that these are (with rare exceptions) fine modules that you
    are encouraged to continue to use. Their disinclusion from core primarily
    hinges on their necessity to bootstrapping a fully functional, CPAN-capable

  <li>Specifying <span class="Li">&quot;\o{}&quot;</span> without anything

  <li>Within the scope of the experimental feature <span class="Li">&quot;use re

      digits&quot;. This means the same wording is used for this kind of error
      as with similar constructs such as

  <li>Compilation under <span class="Li">&quot;-DPERL_MEM_LOG&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;-DNO_LOCALE&quot;</span> have been fixed.</li>
  <li>Perl 5.28 introduced an <span class="Li">&quot;index()&quot;</span>
      optimization when comparing to -1 (or indirectly, e.g. &gt;= 0). When this
      optimization was triggered inside a
      <span class="Li">&quot;when&quot;</span> clause it caused a warning
      (&quot;Argument <span class="Li">%s</span> isn't numeric in smart
      match&quot;). This has now been fixed. [perl #133368]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=133368&gt;</li>
  <li>The new in-place editing code no longer leaks directory handles. [perl
      #133314] &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=133314&gt;.</li>
  <li>Warnings produced from constant folding operations on overloaded values no
      longer produce spurious &quot;Use of uninitialized value&quot; warnings.
      [perl #132683]
    &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=132683&gt;.</li>
  <li>Fix for &quot;mutator not seen in (lex = ...) .= ...&quot; [perl #133441]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=133441&gt;.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;pack &quot;u&quot;, &quot;invalid
      uuencoding&quot;&quot;</span> now properly NUL terminates the zero-length
      SV produced. [perl #132655]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=132655&gt;.</li>
  <li>Improve the debugging output for <b>calloc()</b> calls with
      <span class="Li">&quot;-Dm&quot;</span>. [perl #133439]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=133439&gt;.</li>
  <li>Regexp script runs were failing to permit ASCII digits in some cases.
      [perl #133547]
    &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=133547&gt;.</li>
  <li>On Unix-like systems supporting a platform-specific technique for
      determining <span class="Li">$^X</span>, Perl failed to fall back to the
      generic technique when the platform-specific one fails (for example, a
      Linux system with /proc not mounted). This was a regression in Perl
      5.28.0. [perl #133573]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=133573&gt;.</li>
  <li>SDBM_File is now more robust with corrupt database files. The improvements
      do not make SDBM files suitable as an interchange format. [perl #132147]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=132147&gt;.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;binmode($fh);&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;binmode($fh, ':raw');&quot;</span> now properly
      removes the <span class="Li">&quot;:utf8&quot;</span> flag from the
      default <span class="Li">&quot;:crlf&quot;</span> I/O layer on Win32.
      [perl #133604]
    &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=133604&gt;.</li>
  <li>The experimental reference aliasing feature was misinterpreting array and
      hash slice assignment as being localised, e.g.
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    \(@a[3,5,7]) = \(....);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">was being interpreted as:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    local \(@a[3,5,7]) = \(....);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">[perl #133538]

  </li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;sort SUBNAME&quot;</span> within an
      <span class="Li">&quot;eval EXPR&quot;</span> when
      <span class="Li">&quot;EXPR&quot;</span> was UTF-8 upgraded could panic if
      the <span class="Li">&quot;SUBNAME&quot;</span> was non-ASCII. [perl
      #134061] &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=134061&gt;.</li>
  <li>Correctly handle <b>realloc()</b> modifying
      <span class="Li">&quot;errno&quot;</span> on success so that the
      modification isn't visible to the perl user, since <b>realloc()</b> is
      called implicitly by the interpreter. This modification is permitted by
      the C standard, but has only been observed on FreeBSD 13.0-CURRENT. [perl
      #133958] &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=133958&gt;.</li>
  <li>Perl now exposes POSIX <span class="Li">&quot;getcwd&quot;</span> as
      <span class="Li">&quot;Internals::getcwd()&quot;</span> if available. This
      is intended for use by <span class="Li">&quot;Cwd.pm&quot;</span> during
      bootstrapping and may be removed or changed without notice. This fixes
      some bootstrapping issues while building perl in a directory where some
      ancestor directory isn't readable. [perl #133951]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=133951&gt;.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;pack()&quot;</span> no longer can return malformed
      UTF-8. It croaks if it would otherwise return a UTF-8 string that contains
      malformed UTF-8. This protects against potential security threats. [perl
      #131642] &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=131642&gt;.</li>
  <li>See &quot;Any set of digits in the Common script are legal in a script run
      of another script&quot;.</li>
  <li>Regular expression matching no longer leaves stale UTF-8 length magic when
      updating <span class="Li">$^R</span>. This could result in
      <span class="Li">&quot;length($^R)&quot;</span> returning an incorrect
      value.</li>
  <li>Reduce recursion on ops [perl #108276]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=108276&gt;.
    <p class="Pp">This can prevent stack overflow when processing extremely deep
        op trees.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Avoid leak in multiconcat with overloading. [perl #133789]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=133789&gt;.</li>
  <li>The handling of user-defined <span class="Li">&quot;\p{}&quot;</span>
      properties (see &quot;User-Defined Character Properties&quot; in
      perlunicode) has been rewritten to be in C (instead of Perl). This speeds
      things up, but in the process several inconsistencies and bug fixes are
      made.</li>
</ul>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>1.</dt>
  <dd>A few error messages have minor wording changes. This is essentially
      because the new way is integrated into the regex error handling mechanism
      that marks the position in the input at which the error occurred. That was
      not possible previously. The messages now also contain additional
      back-trace-like information in case the error occurs deep in nested
    calls.</dd>
  <dt>2.</dt>
  <dd>A user-defined property is implemented as a perl subroutine with certain
      highly constrained naming conventions. It was documented previously that
      the sub would be in the current package if the package was unspecified.
      This turned out not to be true in all cases, but now it is.</dd>
  <dt>3.</dt>
  <dd>All recursive calls are treated as infinite recursion. Previously they
      would cause the interpreter to panic. Now, they cause the regex pattern to
      fail to compile.</dd>
  <dt>4.</dt>
  <dd>Similarly, any other error likely would lead to a panic; now to just the
      pattern failing to compile.</dd>
  <dt>5.</dt>
  <dd>The old mechanism did not detect illegal ranges in the definition of the
      property. Now, the range max must not be smaller than the range min.
      Otherwise, the pattern fails to compile.</dd>
  <dt>6.</dt>
  <dd>The intention was to have each sub called only once during the lifetime of
      the program, so that a property's definition is immutable. This was
      relaxed so that it could be called once for all /i compilations, and
      potentially a second time for non-/i (the sub is passed a parameter
      indicating which). However, in practice there were instances when this was
      broken, and multiple calls were possible. Those have been fixed. Now
      (besides the /i,non-/i cases) the only way a sub can be called multiple
      times is if some component of it has not been defined yet. For example,
      suppose we have sub <b>IsA()</b> whose definition is known at compile
      time, and it in turn calls <b>isB()</b> whose definition is not yet known.
      <b>isA()</b> will be called each time a pattern it appears in is compiled.
      If <b>isA()</b> also calls <b>isC()</b> and that definition is known,
      <b>isC()</b> will be called just once.</dd>
  <dt>7.</dt>
  <dd>There were some races and very long hangs should one thread be compiling
      the same property as another simultaneously. These have now been
    fixed.</dd>

</div>
<div class="Bd-indent"></div>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Fixed a failure to match properly.
    <p class="Pp">An EXACTFish regnode has a finite length it can hold for the
        string being matched. If that length is exceeded, a second node is used
        for the next segment of the string, for as many regnodes as are needed.
        Care has to be taken where to break the string, in order to deal
        multi-character folds in Unicode correctly. If we want to break a string
        at a place which could potentially be in the middle of a multi-character
        fold, we back off one (or more) characters, leaving a shorter EXACTFish
        regnode. This backing off mechanism contained an off-by-one error. [perl
        #133756] &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=133756&gt;.</p>
  </li>
  <li>A bare <span class="Li">&quot;eof&quot;</span> call with no previous file
      handle now returns true. [perl #133721]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=133721&gt;</li>
  <li>Failing to compile a format now aborts compilation. Like other errors in
      sub-parses this could leave the parser in a strange state, possibly
      crashing perl if compilation continued. [perl #132158]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=132158&gt;</li>
  <li>If an in-place edit is still in progress during global destruction and the
      process exit code (as stored in <span class="Li">$?</span>) is zero, perl
      will now treat the in-place edit as successful, replacing the input file
      with any output produced.
    <p class="Pp">This allows code like:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
  perl -i -ne 'print &quot;Foo&quot;; last'
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">to replace the input file, while code like:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
  perl -i -ne 'print &quot;Foo&quot;; die'
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">will not. Partly resolves [perl #133659]
        &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=133659&gt;.</p>
  </li>
  <li>A regression in 5.28 caused the following code to fail
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
 close(STDIN); open(CHILD, &quot;|wc -l&quot;)'
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">because the child's stdin would be closed on exec. This has
        now been fixed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Fixed an issue where compiling a regexp containing both compile-time and
      run-time code blocks could lead to trying to compile something which is
      invalid syntax.</li>
  <li>Fixed build failures with
      <span class="Li">&quot;-DNO_LOCALE_NUMERIC&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;-DNO_LOCALE_COLLATE&quot;</span>. [perl #133696]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=133696&gt;.</li>
  <li>Prevent the tests in <i>ext/B/t/strict.t</i> from being skipped. [perl
      #133713] &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=133713&gt;.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;/di&quot;</span> nodes ending or beginning in
      <i>s</i> are now <span class="Li">&quot;EXACTF&quot;</span>. We do not
      want two <span class="Li">&quot;EXACTFU&quot;</span> to be joined together
      during optimization, and to form a <span class="Li">&quot;ss&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;sS&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;Ss&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;SS&quot;</span> sequence; they are the only
      multi-character sequences which may match differently under
      <span class="Li">&quot;/ui&quot;</span> and
