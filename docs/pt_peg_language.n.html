   The definitions below are for supplemental macros used in Tcl/Tk
   manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget.  The
  	options follow on successive lines, in four columns separated
  	by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.

<p class="Pp">Welcome to the tutorial / introduction for the <b>PEG
    Specification Language</b>. If you are already familiar with the language we

<h2 class="Ss" id="BASIC_STRUCTURE"><a class="permalink" href="#BASIC_STRUCTURE">BASIC
  STRUCTURE</a></h2>
The general outline of a textual PEG is
<pre>
PEG &lt;&lt;name&gt;&gt; (&lt;&lt;start-expression&gt;&gt;)
   &lt;&lt;rules&gt;&gt;
END;
</pre>
<i>Note</i>: We are using text in double angle-brackets as place-holders for
  things not yet explained.
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="NAMES"><a class="permalink" href="#NAMES">NAMES</a></h2>
Names are mostly used to identify the nonterminal symbols of the grammar, i.e.
  that which occurs on the left-hand side of a &lt;rule&gt;. The exception to
  that is the name given after the keyword <b>PEG</b> (see previous section),
  which is the name of the whole grammar itself.
<p class="Pp">The structure of a name is simple:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>[1]</dt>
  <dd>It begins with a letter, underscore, or colon, followed by</dd>
  <dt>[2]</dt>
  <dd>zero or more letters, digits, underscores, or colons.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Or, in formal textual notation:</p>
<pre>
    ([_:] / &lt;alpha&gt;) ([_:] / &lt;alnum&gt;)*
</pre>
Examples of names:
<pre>
    Hello
    ::world
    _:submarine55_
</pre>
Examples of text which are <i>not</i> names:
<pre>
    12
    .bogus
    0wrong
    @location
</pre>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="RULES"><a class="permalink" href="#RULES">RULES</a></h2>
The main body of the text of a grammar specification is taken up by the rules.
  Each rule defines the sentence structure of one nonterminal symbol. Their
  basic structure is
<pre>
     &lt;&lt;name&gt;&gt;  &lt;-  &lt;&lt;expression&gt;&gt; ;
</pre>
The &lt;name&gt; specifies the nonterminal symbol to be defined, the
  &lt;expression&gt; after the arrow (&lt;-) then declares its structure.
<p class="Pp">Note that each rule ends in a single semicolon, even the last.
    I.e. the semicolon is a rule <i>terminator</i>, not a separator.</p>
<p class="Pp">We can have as many rules as we like, as long as we define each
    nonterminal symbol at most once, and have at least one rule for each
    nonterminal symbol which occured in an expression, i.e. in either the start
    expression of the grammar, or the right-hande side of a rule.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="EXPRESSIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#EXPRESSIONS">EXPRESSIONS</a></h2>
The <i>parsing</i> expressions are the meat of any specification. They declare
  the structure of the whole document (&lt;&lt;start-expression&gt;&gt;), and of
  all nonterminal symbols.
<p class="Pp">All expressions are made up out of <i>atomic expressions</i> and
    <i>operators</i> combining them. We have operators for choosing between
    alternatives, repetition of parts, and for look-ahead constraints. There is
    no explicit operator for the sequencing (also known as <i>concatenation</i>)
    of parts however. This is specified by simply placing the parts adjacent to
    each other.</p>
<p class="Pp">Here are the operators, from highest to lowest priority (i.e.
    strength of binding):</p>
<pre>
    # Binary operators.
    &lt;&lt;expression-1&gt;&gt;     &lt;&lt;expression-2&gt;&gt;  # sequence. parse 1, then 2.
    &lt;&lt;expression-1&gt;&gt;  /  &lt;&lt;expression-2&gt;&gt;  # alternative. try to parse 1, and parse 2 if 1 failed to parse.
    # Prefix operators. Lookahead constraints. Same priority.
    &amp; &lt;&lt;expression&gt;&gt;  # Parse expression, ok on successful parse.
    ! &lt;&lt;expression&gt;&gt;  # Ditto, except ok on failure to parse.
    # Suffix operators. Repetition. Same priority.
    &lt;&lt;expression&gt;&gt; ?  # Parse expression none, or once (repeat 0 or 1).
    &lt;&lt;expression&gt;&gt; *  # Parse expression zero or more times.
    &lt;&lt;expression&gt;&gt; +  # Parse expression one or more times.
    # Expression nesting
    ( &lt;&lt;expression&gt;&gt; ) # Put an expression in parens to change its priority.
</pre>
With this we can now deconstruct the formal expression for names given in
  section <b>Names</b>:
<pre>
    ([_:] / &lt;alpha&gt;) ([_:] / &lt;alnum&gt;)*
</pre>
It is a sequence of two parts,
<pre>
    [_:] / &lt;alpha&gt;
</pre>
and
<pre>
    ([_:] / &lt;alnum&gt;)*
</pre>
The parentheses around the parts kept their inner alternatives bound together
  against the normally higher priority of the sequence. Each of the two parts is
  an alternative, with the second part additionally repeated zero or more times,
  leaving us with the three atomic expressions
<pre>
    [_:]
    &lt;alpha&gt;
    &lt;alnum&gt;
</pre>
And <i>atomic expressions</i> are our next topic. They fall into three classes:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>[1]</dt>
  <dd>names, i.e. nonterminal symbols,</dd>
  <dt>[2]</dt>
  <dd>string literals, and</dd>
  <dt>[3]</dt>
  <dd>character classes.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Names we know about already, or see section <b>Names</b> for a
    refresher.</p>
<p class="Pp">String literals are simple. They are delimited by (i.e. start and
    end with) either a single or double-apostroph, and in between the delimiters
    we can have any character but the delimiter itself. They can be empty as
    well. Examples of strings are</p>
<pre>
    ''
    &quot;&quot;
    'hello'
    &quot;umbra&quot;
    &quot;'&quot;
    '&quot;'
</pre>
The last two examples show how to place any of the delimiters into a string.
<p class="Pp">For the last, but not least of our atomic expressions, character
    classes, we have a number of predefined classes, shown below, and the
    ability to construct or own. The predefined classes are:</p>
<pre>
    &lt;alnum&gt;    # Any unicode alphabet or digit character (string is alnum).
    &lt;alpha&gt;    # Any unicode alphabet character (string is alpha).
    &lt;ascii&gt;    # Any unicode character below codepoint 0x80 (string is ascii).
    &lt;control&gt;  # Any unicode control character (string is control).
    &lt;ddigit&gt;   # The digit characters [0-9].
    &lt;digit&gt;    # Any unicode digit character (string is digit).
    &lt;graph&gt;    # Any unicode printing character, except space (string is graph).
    &lt;lower&gt;    # Any unicode lower-case alphabet character (string is lower).
    &lt;print&gt;    # Any unicode printing character, incl. space (string is print).
    &lt;punct&gt;    # Any unicode punctuation character (string is punct).
    &lt;space&gt;    # Any unicode space character (string is space).
    &lt;upper&gt;    # Any unicode upper-case alphabet character (string is upper).
    &lt;wordchar&gt; # Any unicode word character (string is wordchar).
    &lt;xdigit&gt;   # The hexadecimal digit characters [0-9a-fA-F].
    .          # Any character, except end of input.
</pre>
And the syntax of custom-defined character classes is
<pre>
    [ &lt;&lt;range&gt;&gt;* ]
</pre>
where each range is either a single character, or of the form
<pre>
   &lt;&lt;character&gt;&gt; - &lt;character&gt;&gt;
</pre>
Examples for character classes we have seen already in the course of this
  introduction are
<pre>
    [_:]
    [0-9]
    [0-9a-fA-F]
</pre>
We are nearly done with expressions. The only piece left is to tell how the
  characters in character classes and string literals are specified.
<p class="Pp">Basically characters in the input stand for themselves, and in
    addition to that we several types of escape syntax to to repesent control
    characters, or characters outside of the encoding the text is in.</p>
<p class="Pp">All the escaped forms are started with a backslash character ('\',
    unicode codepoint 0x5C). This is then followed by a series of octal digits,
    or 'u' and hexedecimal digits, or a regular character from a fixed set for
    various control characters. Some examples:</p>
<pre>
    \n \r \t \' \&quot; \[ \] \\ #
    \000 up to \277         # octal escape, all ascii character, leading 0's can be removed.
    \u2CA7                  # hexadecimal escape, all unicode characters.
    #                       # Here 2ca7 &lt;=&gt; Koptic Small Letter Tau
</pre>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="WHITESPACE_AND_COMMENTS"><a class="permalink" href="#WHITESPACE_AND_COMMENTS">WHITESPACE
  AND COMMENTS</a></h2>
One issue not touched upon so far is whitespace and comments.
<p class="Pp">Whitespace is any unicode space character, i.e. anything in the
    character class &lt;space&gt;, and comments. The latter are sequences of
    characters starting with a '#' (hash, unicode codepoint 0x23) and ending at
    the next end-of-line.</p>
<p class="Pp">Whitespace can be freely used between all syntactical elements of
    a grammar specification. It cannot be used inside of syntactical elements,
    like names, string literals, predefined character classes, etc.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="NONTERMINAL_ATTRIBUTES"><a class="permalink" href="#NONTERMINAL_ATTRIBUTES">NONTERMINAL
  ATTRIBUTES</a></h2>
Lastly, a more advanced topic. In the section <b>Rules</b> we gave the structure
  of a rule as
<pre>
     &lt;&lt;name&gt;&gt;  &lt;-  &lt;&lt;expression&gt;&gt; ;
</pre>
This is not quite true. It is possible to associate a semantic mode with the
  nonterminal in the rule, by writing it before the name, separated from it by a
  colon, i.e. writing
<pre>
    &lt;&lt;mode&gt;&gt; : &lt;&lt;name&gt;&gt;  &lt;-  &lt;&lt;expression&gt;&gt; ;
</pre>
is also allowed. This mode is optional. The known modes and their meanings are:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>value</b></dt>
  <dd>The semantic value of the nonterminal symbol is an abstract syntax tree
      consisting of a single node node for the nonterminal itself, which has the
      ASTs of the symbol's right hand side as its children.</dd>
  <dt><b>leaf</b></dt>
  <dd>The semantic value of the nonterminal symbol is an abstract syntax tree
      consisting of a single node node for the nonterminal, without any
      children. Any ASTs generated by the symbol's right hand side are
      discarded.</dd>
  <dt><b>void</b></dt>
  <dd>The nonterminal has no semantic value. Any ASTs generated by the symbol's
      right hand side are discarded (as well).</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Of these three modes only <b>leaf</b> and <b>void</b> can be
    specified directly. <b>value</b> is implicitly specified by the absence of a
    mode before the nonterminal.</p>
<p class="Pp">Now, with all the above under our belt it should be possible to
    not only read, but understand the formal specification of the text
    representation shown in the next section, written in itself.</p>

PEG calculator (Expression)
    Digit      &lt;- '0'/'1'/'2'/'3'/'4'/'5'/'6'/'7'/'8'/'9'	;
    Sign       &lt;- '-' / '+'					;

<p class="Pp">Using higher-level features of the notation, i.e. the character
    classes (predefined and custom), this example can be rewritten as</p>
