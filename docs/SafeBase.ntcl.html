   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

Safe Tcl is a mechanism for executing untrusted Tcl scripts safely and for
  providing mediated access by such scripts to potentially dangerous
  functionality.
<p class="Pp">The Safe Base ensures that untrusted Tcl scripts cannot harm the
    hosting application. The Safe Base prevents integrity and privacy attacks.
    Untrusted Tcl scripts are prevented from corrupting the state of the hosting
    application or computer. Untrusted scripts are also prevented from
    disclosing information stored on the hosting computer or in the hosting
    application to any party.</p>
<p class="Pp">The Safe Base allows a master interpreter to create safe,
    restricted interpreters that contain a set of predefined aliases for the
    <b>source</b>, <b>load</b>, <b>file</b>, <b>encoding</b>, and <b>exit</b>
    commands and are able to use the auto-loading and package mechanisms.</p>
<p class="Pp">No knowledge of the file system structure is leaked to the safe
    interpreter, because it has access only to a virtualized path containing
    tokens. When the safe interpreter requests to source a file, it uses the
    token in the virtual path as part of the file name to source; the master
    interpreter transparently translates the token into a real directory name
    and executes the requested operation (see the section <b>SECURITY</b> below
    for details). Different levels of security can be selected by using the
    optional flags of the commands described below.</p>
<p class="Pp">All commands provided in the master interpreter by the Safe Base
    reside in the <b>safe</b> namespace.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="COMMANDS"><a class="permalink" href="#COMMANDS">COMMANDS</a></h1>
The following commands are provided in the master interpreter:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>::safe::interpCreate</b> ?<i>slave</i>? ?<i>options...</i>?</dt>
  <dd>Creates a safe interpreter, installs the aliases described in the section
      <b>ALIASES</b> and initializes the auto-loading and package mechanism as
      specified by the supplied <b>options</b>. See the <b>OPTIONS</b> section
      below for a description of the optional arguments. If the <i>slave</i>
      argument is omitted, a name will be generated. <b>::safe::interpCreate</b>
      always returns the interpreter name.</dd>
  <dt><b>::safe::interpInit</b> <i>slave</i> ?<i>options...</i>?</dt>
  <dd>This command is similar to <b>interpCreate</b> except it that does not
      create the safe interpreter. <i>slave</i> must have been created by some
      other means, like <b>interp create -safe</b>.</dd>
  <dt><b>::safe::interpConfigure</b> <i>slave</i> ?<i>options...</i>?</dt>
  <dd>If no <i>options</i> are given, returns the settings for all options for
      the named safe interpreter as a list of options and their current values
      for that <i>slave</i>. If a single additional argument is provided, it
      will return a list of 2 elements <i>name</i> and <i>value</i> where
      <i>name</i> is the full name of that option and <i>value</i> the current
      value for that option and the <i>slave</i>. If more than two additional
      arguments are provided, it will reconfigure the safe interpreter and
      change each and only the provided options. See the section on
      <b>OPTIONS</b> below for options description. Example of use:</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>::safe::interpDelete</b> <i>slave</i></dt>
  <dd>Deletes the safe interpreter and cleans up the corresponding master

      with the name of the interpreter as an additional argument.</dd>
  <dt><b>::safe::interpFindInAccessPath</b> <i>slave</i> <i>directory</i></dt>
  <dd>This command finds and returns the token for the real directory
      <i>directory</i> in the safe interpreter's current virtual access path. It

  <dd>This command adds <i>directory</i> to the virtual path maintained for the
      safe interpreter in the master, and returns the token that can be used in
      the safe interpreter to obtain access to files in that directory. If the
      directory is already in the virtual path, it only returns the token

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>::safe::setLogCmd</b> ?<i>cmd arg...</i>?</dt>
  <dd>This command installs a script that will be called when interesting life
      cycle events occur for a safe interpreter. When called with no arguments,
      it returns the currently installed script. When called with one argument,
      an empty string, the currently installed script is removed and logging is
      turned off. The script will be invoked with one additional argument, a
      string describing the event of interest. The main purpose is to help in
      debugging safe interpreters. Using this facility you can get complete
      error messages while the safe interpreter gets only generic error
      messages. This prevents a safe interpreter from seeing messages about
      failures and other events that might contain sensitive information such as
      real directory names.</dd>

The following options are common to <b>::safe::interpCreate</b>,
  <b>::safe::interpInit</b>, and <b>::safe::interpConfigure</b>. Any option name
  can be abbreviated to its minimal non-ambiguous name. Option names are not
  case sensitive.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>-accessPath</b> <i>directoryList</i></dt>
  <dd>This option sets the list of directories from which the safe interpreter
      can <b>source</b> and <b>load</b> files. If this option is not specified,
      or if it is given as the empty list, the safe interpreter will use the
      same directories as its master for auto-loading. See the section
      <b>SECURITY</b> below for more detail about virtual paths, tokens and
      access control.</dd>
  <dt><b>-statics</b> <i>boolean</i></dt>
  <dd>This option specifies if the safe interpreter will be allowed to load
      statically linked packages (like <b>load {} Tk</b>). The default value is
      <b>true</b> : safe interpreters are allowed to load statically linked
      packages.</dd>
  <dt><b>-noStatics</b></dt>
  <dd>This option is a convenience shortcut for <b>-statics false</b> and thus
      specifies that the safe interpreter will not be allowed to load statically
      linked packages.</dd>
  <dt><b>-nested</b> <i>boolean</i></dt>
  <dd>This option specifies if the safe interpreter will be allowed to load
      packages into its own sub-interpreters. The default value is <b>false</b>
      : safe interpreters are not allowed to load packages into their own
      sub-interpreters.</dd>
  <dt><b>-nestedLoadOk</b></dt>
  <dd>This option is a convenience shortcut for <b>-nested true</b> and thus
      specifies the safe interpreter will be allowed to load packages into its
      own sub-interpreters.</dd>
  <dt><b>-deleteHook</b> <i>script</i></dt>
  <dd>When this option is given a non-empty <i>script</i>, it will be evaluated
      in the master with the name of the safe interpreter as an additional
      argument just before actually deleting the safe interpreter. Giving an
      empty value removes any currently installed deletion hook script for that
      safe interpreter. The default value (<b>{}</b>) is not to have any

The following aliases are provided in a safe interpreter:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>source</b> <i>fileName</i></dt>
  <dd>The requested file, a Tcl source file, is sourced into the safe
      interpreter if it is found. The <b>source</b> alias can only source files
      from directories in the virtual path for the safe interpreter. The
      <b>source</b> alias requires the safe interpreter to use one of the token
      names in its virtual path to denote the directory in which the file to be
      sourced can be found. See the section on <b>SECURITY</b> for more
      discussion of restrictions on valid filenames.</dd>
  <dt><b>load</b> <i>fileName</i></dt>
  <dd>The requested file, a shared object file, is dynamically loaded into the
      safe interpreter if it is found. The filename must contain a token name
      mentioned in the virtual path for the safe interpreter for it to be found
      successfully. Additionally, the shared object file must contain a safe
      entry point; see the manual page for the <b>load</b> command for more
      details.</dd>
  <dt><b>file</b> ?<i>subCmd args...</i>?</dt>
  <dd>The <b>file</b> alias provides access to a safe subset of the subcommands
      of the <b>file</b> command; it allows only <b>dirname</b>, <b>join</b>,
      <b>extension</b>, <b>root</b>, <b>tail</b>, <b>pathname</b> and
      <b>split</b> subcommands. For more details on what these subcommands do
      see the manual page for the <b>file</b> command.</dd>
  <dt><b>encoding</b> ?<i>subCmd args...</i>?</dt>
  <dd>The <b>encoding</b> alias provides access to a safe subset of the
      subcommands of the <b>encoding</b> command; it disallows setting of the
      system encoding, but allows all other subcommands including <b>system</b>
      to check the current encoding.</dd>
  <dt><b>exit</b></dt>
  <dd>The calling interpreter is deleted and its computation is stopped, but the
      Tcl process in which this interpreter exists is not terminated.</dd>

<h1 class="Sh" id="SECURITY"><a class="permalink" href="#SECURITY">SECURITY</a></h1>
The Safe Base does not attempt to completely prevent annoyance and denial of
  service attacks. These forms of attack prevent the application or user from
  temporarily using the computer to perform useful work, for example by
  consuming all available CPU time or all available screen real estate. These
  attacks, while aggravating, are deemed to be of lesser importance in general
  than integrity and privacy attacks that the Safe Base is to prevent.
<p class="Pp">The commands available in a safe interpreter, in addition to the
    safe set as defined in <b>interp</b> manual page, are mediated aliases for
    <b>source</b>, <b>load</b>, <b>exit</b>, and safe subsets of <b>file</b> and
    <b>encoding</b>. The safe interpreter can also auto-load code and it can
    request that packages be loaded.</p>
<p class="Pp">Because some of these commands access the local file system, there
    is a potential for information leakage about its directory structure. To
    prevent this, commands that take file names as arguments in a safe
    interpreter use tokens instead of the real directory names. These tokens are
    translated to the real directory name while a request to, e.g., source a
    file is mediated by the master interpreter. This virtual path system is
    maintained in the master interpreter for each safe interpreter created by
    <b>::safe::interpCreate</b> or initialized by <b>::safe::interpInit</b> and
    the path maps tokens accessible in the safe interpreter into real path names
    on the local file system thus preventing safe interpreters from gaining
    knowledge about the structure of the file system of the host on which the
    interpreter is executing. The only valid file names arguments for the
    <b>source</b> and <b>load</b> aliases provided to the slave are path in the
    form of <b>[file join </b><i>token filename</i><b>]</b> (i.e. when using the
    native file path formats: <i>token</i><b>/</b><i>filename</i> on Unix and
    <i>token</i><b>\</b><i>filename</i> on Windows), where <i>token</i> is
    representing one of the directories of the <i>accessPath</i> list and
    <i>filename</i> is one file in that directory (no sub directories access are
    allowed).</p>
<p class="Pp">When a token is used in a safe interpreter in a request to source
    or load a file, the token is checked and translated to a real path name and
    the file to be sourced or loaded is located on the file system. The safe
    interpreter never gains knowledge of the actual path name under which the
    file is stored on the file system.</p>
<p class="Pp">To further prevent potential information leakage from sensitive
    files that are accidentally included in the set of files that can be sourced
    by a safe interpreter, the <b>source</b> alias restricts access to files
    meeting the following constraints: the file name must fourteen characters or
    shorter, must not contain more than one dot (&#x201C;<b>.</b>&#x201D;), must
    end up with the extension (&#x201C;<b>.tcl</b>&#x201D;) or be called
    (&#x201C;<b>tclIndex</b>&#x201D;.)</p>
<p class="Pp">Each element of the initial access path list will be assigned a
    token that will be set in the slave <b>auto_path</b> and the first element
    of that list will be set as the <b>tcl_library</b> for that slave.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the access path argument is not given or is the empty list, the
    default behavior is to let the slave access the same packages as the master
    has access to (Or to be more precise: only packages written in Tcl (which by
    definition cannot be dangerous as they run in the slave interpreter) and C
    extensions that provides a _SafeInit entry point). For that purpose, the
    master's <b>auto_path</b> will be used to construct the slave access path.
    In order that the slave successfully loads the Tcl library files (which
    includes the auto-loading mechanism itself) the <b>tcl_library</b> will be
    added or moved to the first position if necessary, in the slave access path,
    so the slave <b>tcl_library</b> will be the same as the master's (its real
    path will still be invisible to the slave though). In order that
    auto-loading works the same for the slave and the master in this by default
    case, the first-level sub directories of each directory in the master
    <b>auto_path</b> will also be added (if not already included) to the slave
    access path. You can always specify a more restrictive path for which sub
    directories will never be searched by explicitly specifying your directory
    list with the <b>-accessPath</b> flag instead of relying on this default
    mechanism.</p>
<p class="Pp">When the <i>accessPath</i> is changed after the first creation or
    initialization (i.e. through <b>interpConfigure -accessPath
    </b><i>list</i>), an <b>auto_reset</b> is automatically evaluated in the
    safe interpreter to synchronize its <b>auto_index</b> with the new token
    list.</p>
