   Set up some character translations and predefined strings.  \*(-- will
   give an unbreakable dash, \*(PI will give pi, \*(L" will give a left
   double quote, and \*(R" will give a right double quote.  \*(C+ will
   give a nicer C++.  Capital omega is used to do unbreakable dashes and
   therefore won't be available.  \*(C` and \*(C' expand to `' in nroff,
   nothing in troff, for use with C<>.

perl5224delta - what is new for perl v5.22.4

This document describes differences between the 5.22.3 release and the 5.22.4
  release.
<p class="Pp">If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.22.2, first
    read perl5223delta, which describes differences between 5.22.2 and
  5.22.3.</p>

  handling of '.' in @INC in base.pm</a></h2>
The handling of (the removal of) <span class="Li">'.'</span> in
  <span class="Li">@INC</span> in base has been improved. This resolves some
  problematic behaviour in the approach taken in Perl 5.22.3, which is probably
  best described in the following two threads on the Perl 5 Porters mailing
  list:
  &lt;http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2016/08/msg238991.html&gt;,

  colons and relative paths in PATH</a></h2>
On Unix systems, Perl treats any relative paths in the PATH environment variable
  as tainted when starting a new process. Previously, it was allowing a
  backslash to escape a colon (unlike the OS), consequently allowing relative
  paths to be considered safe if the PATH was set to something like
  <span class="Li">&quot;/\:.&quot;</span>. The check has been fixed to treat
  <span class="Li">&quot;.&quot;</span> as tainted in that example.

Perl 5.22.4 represents approximately 6 months of development since Perl 5.22.3
  and contains approximately 2,200 lines of changes across 52 files from 16
  authors.
<p class="Pp">Excluding auto-generated files, documentation and release tools,
    there were approximately 970 lines of changes to 18 .pm, .t, .c and .h
    files.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl continues to flourish into its third decade thanks to a
    vibrant community of users and developers. The following people are known to
    have contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.22.4:</p>
<p class="Pp">Aaron Crane, Abigail, Aristotle Pagaltzis, Chris 'BinGOs'
    Williams, David Mitchell, Eric Herman, Father Chrysostomos, James E Keenan,
    Karl Williamson, Lukas Mai, Renee Baecker, Ricardo Signes, Sawyer X, Stevan
    Little, Steve Hay, Tony Cook.</p>
<p class="Pp">The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is
    automatically generated from version control history. In particular, it does
    not include the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who
    reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.</p>
<p class="Pp">Many of the changes included in this version originated in the
    CPAN modules included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire CPAN
    community for helping Perl to flourish.</p>
<p class="Pp">For a more complete list of all of Perl's historical contributors,
    please see the <i>AUTHORS</i> file in the Perl source distribution.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="Reporting_Bugs"><a class="permalink" href="#Reporting_Bugs">Reporting
  Bugs</a></h1>
If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
  posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
  https://rt.perl.org/ . There may also be information at http://www.perl.org/ ,
  the Perl Home Page.
<p class="Pp">If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug
    program included with your release. Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny
    but sufficient test case. Your bug report, along with the output of
    <span class="Li">&quot;perl -V&quot;</span>, will be sent off to
    perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make
    it inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please
    send it to perl5-security-report@perl.org. This points to a closed
    subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core
    committers, who will be able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out
    a resolution, and help co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix
    the problem across all platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use
    this address for security issues in the Perl core, not for modules
    independently distributed on CPAN.</p>
