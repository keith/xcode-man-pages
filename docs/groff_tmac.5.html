The <b>roff</b>(7) type-setting system provides a set of macro packages suitable
  for special kinds of documents. Each macro package stores its macros and
  definitions in a file called the package's <b>tmac file</b>. The name is
  deduced from `<b>T</b><i>roff</i><b>MAC</b><i>ros</i>'.
<p class="Pp">The tmac files are normal roff source documents, except that they
    usually contain only definitions and setup commands, but no text. All tmac
    files are kept in a single or a small number of directories, the <b>tmac</b>
    directories.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="NAMING"><a class="permalink" href="#NAMING">NAMING</a></h1>
In classical roff systems, there was a funny naming scheme for macro packages,
  due to a simplistic design in option parsing. Macro packages were always
  included by option <b>-m;</b> when this option was directly followed by its
  argument without an intervening space, this looked like a long option preceded
  by a single minus &#x2014; a sensation in the computer stone age. To make this
  optically working for macro package names, all classical macro packages choose
  a name that started with the letter `<span class="Li">m</span>', which was
  omitted in the naming of the macro file.
<p class="Pp">For example, the macro package for the man pages was called
    <i>man</i>, while its macro file <i>tmac.an</i>. So it could be activated by
    the argument <i>an</i> to option <b>-m</b>, or <b>-man</b> for short.</p>
<p class="Pp">For similar reasons, macro packages that did not start with an
    `<span class="Li">m</span>' had a leading `<span class="Li">m</span>' added
    in the documentation and in talking; for example, the package corresponding
    to <i>tmac.doc</i> was called <i>mdoc</i> in the documentation, although a
    more suitable name would be <i>doc</i>. For, when omitting the space between
    the option and its argument, the command line option for activating this
    package reads <b>-mdoc</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">To cope with all situations, actual versions of <b>groff</b>(1)
    are smart about both naming schemes by providing two macro files for the
    inflicted macro packages; one with a leading `<span class="Li">m</span>',
    the other one without it. So in <i>groff</i>, the <i>man</i> macro package
    may be specified as on of the following four methods:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd><span class="Li"></span>
    <br/>
    <pre>

    </pre>
    <br/>
    ].groffer:Shell_cmd.prompt_text <span class="Li">&quot; &quot;</span>
      <span class="Li"></span>
    <br/>
    <pre>

    </pre>
    <br/>
    ].groffer:Shell_cmd.prompt_text <span class="Li">&quot; &quot;</span>
      <span class="Li"></span>
    <br/>
    <pre>

    </pre>
    <br/>
    ].groffer:Shell_cmd.prompt_text <span class="Li">&quot; &quot;</span>
      <span class="Li"></span>
    <br/>
    <pre>

    </pre>
    <br/>
    ].groffer:Shell_cmd.prompt_text <span class="Li">&quot; &quot;</span></dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Recent packages that do not start with `<span class="Li">m</span>'
    do not use an additional `<span class="Li">m</span>' in the documentation.
    For example, the <i>www</i> macro package may be specified only as one of
    the two methods:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd><span class="Li"></span>
    <br/>
    <pre>

    </pre>
    <br/>
    ].groffer:Shell_cmd.prompt_text <span class="Li">&quot; &quot;</span>
      <span class="Li"></span>
    <br/>
    <pre>

    </pre>
    <br/>
    ].groffer:Shell_cmd.prompt_text <span class="Li">&quot; &quot;</span></dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Obviously, variants like <i>-mmwww</i> would not make much
  sense.</p>
<p class="Pp">A second strange feature of classical troff was to name macro
    files according to <b>tmac.</b><i>name</i>. In modern operating systems, the
    type of a file is specified as postfix, the file name extension. Again,
    groff copes with this situation by searching both
    <i>anything</i><b>.tmac</b> and <b>tmac.</b><i>anything</i> if only
    <i>anything</i> is specified.</p>
<p class="Pp">The easiest way to find out which macro packages are available on
    a system is to check the man&#x00A0;page <b>groff</b>(1), or the contents of
    the <i>tmac</i> directories.</p>
<p class="Pp">In <i>groff</i>, most macro packages are described in&#x00A0;man
    pages called <b>groff_<i>name</i></b>(7), with a leading
    `<span class="Li">m</span>' for the classical packages.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="INCLUSION"><a class="permalink" href="#INCLUSION">INCLUSION</a></h1>
There are several ways to use a macro package in a document. The classical way
  is to specify the troff/groff option <b>-m</b> <i>name</i> at run-time; this
  makes the contents of the macro package <i>name</i> available. In groff, the
  file <i>name</i><b>.tmac</b> is searched within the tmac path; if not found,
  <b>tmac.</b><i>name</i> will be searched for instead.
<p class="Pp">Alternatively, it is also possible to include a macro file by
    adding the request .<b>so</b> <i>filename</i> into the document; the
    argument must be the full file name of an existing file, possibly with the
    directory where it is kept. In groff, this was improved by the similar
    request .<b>mso</b> <i>package</i>, which added searching in the tmac path,
    just like option <b>-m</b> does.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that in order to resolve the .<b>so</b> and .<b>mso</b>
    requests, the roff preprocessor <b>soelim</b>(1) must be called if the files
    to be included need preprocessing. This can be done either directly by a
    pipeline on the command line or by using the troff/groff option <b>-s</b>.
    <i>man</i> calls soelim automatically.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, suppose a macro file is stored as
    <i>/usr/share/groff/1.19.2/tmac/macros.tmac</i> and is used in some document
    called <i>docu.roff</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">At run-time, the formatter call for this is</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="WRITING_MACROS"><a class="permalink" href="#WRITING_MACROS">WRITING
  MACROS</a></h1>
A <b>roff</b>(7) document is a text file that is enriched by predefined
  formatting constructs, such as requests, escape sequences, strings, numeric
  registers, and macros from a macro package. These elements are described in
  <b>roff</b>(7).
<p class="Pp">To give a document a personal style, it is most useful to extend
    the existing elements by defining some macros for repeating tasks; the best
    place for this is near the beginning of the document or in a separate
  file.</p>
<p class="Pp">Macros without arguments are just like strings. But the full power
    of macros reveals when arguments are passed with a macro call. Within the
    macro definition, the arguments are available as the escape sequences
    <b>$1</b>, ..., <b>$9</b>, <b>$[</b>...<b>]</b>, <b>$*</b>, and <b>$@</b>,
    the name under which the macro was called is in <b>$0</b>, and the number of
    arguments is in register <b>2</b>; see <b>groff</b>(7).</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Copy-in_Mode"><a class="permalink" href="#Copy-in_Mode">Copy-in
  Mode</a></h2>
The phase when groff reads a macro is called <i>copy-in mode</i> in roff-talk.
  This is comparable to the C&#x00A0;preprocessing phase during the development
  of a program written in the C&#x00A0;language.
<p class="Pp">In this phase, groff interprets all backslashes; that means that
    all escape sequences in the macro body are interpreted and replaced by their
    value. For constant expression, this is wanted, but strings and registers
    that might change between calls of the macro must be protected from being
    evaluated. This is most easily done by doubling the backslash that
    introduces the escape sequence. This doubling is most important for the
    positional parameters. For example, to print information on the arguments
    that were passed to the macro to the terminal, define a macro named
    `.print_args', say.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<span class="Li"></span><span class="Li">.ds midpart was called with</span>
<span class="Li">.de print_args</span>

<span class="Li">arg1 arg2</span>
</pre>
</div>
<pre>
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Let's analyze each backslash in the macro definition. As the
    positional parameters and the number of arguments will change with each call
    of the macro their leading backslash must be doubled, which results in
    <i>\\$*</i> and <i>\\[.$]</i>. The same applies to the macro name because it
    could be called with an alias name, so <i>\\$0</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">On the other hand, <i>midpart</i> is a constant string, it will
    not change, so no doubling for <i>\*[midpart]</i>. The <i>\f</i> escape
    sequences are predefined groff elements for setting the font within the
    text. Of course, this behavior will not change, so no doubling with
    <i>\f[I]</i> and <i>\f[]</i>.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Draft_Mode"><a class="permalink" href="#Draft_Mode">Draft
  Mode</a></h2>
Writing groff macros is easy when the escaping mechanism is temporarily
  disabled. In groff, this is done by enclosing the macro definition(s) into a
  pair of <b>.eo</b> and <b>.ec</b> requests. Then the body in the macro
  definition is just like a normal part of the document &#x2014; text enhanced
  by calls of requests, macros, strings, registers, etc. For example, the code
  above can be written in a simpler way by
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<span class="Li"></span><span class="Li">.eo</span>
<span class="Li">.ds midpart was called with</span>
<span class="Li">.de print_args</span>
<span class="Li">.&#x00A0;&#x00A0;tm&#x00A0;\f[I]\$0\f[]&#x00A0;\*[midpart]&#x00A0;\n[.$]&#x00A0;arguments:</span>
<span class="Li">.&#x00A0;&#x00A0;tm&#x00A0;\$*</span>
<span class="Li">..</span>
<span class="Li">.ec</span>
</pre>
</div>
<pre>
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Unfortunately, draft mode cannot be used universally. Although it
    is good enough for defining normal macros, draft mode will fail with
    advanced applications, such as indirectly defined strings, registers, etc.
    An optimal way is to define and test all macros in draft mode and then do
    the backslash doubling as a final step; do not forget to remove the
    <i>.eo</i> request.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Diversions"><a class="permalink" href="#Diversions">Diversions</a></h2>
Diversions can be used to realize quite advanced programming constructs. They
  are comparable to pointers to large data structures in the
  C&#x00A0;programming language, but their usage is quite different.
<p class="Pp">In their simplest form, diversions are multi-line strings, but
    they get their power when diversions are used dynamically within macros. The
    information stored in a diversion can be retrieved by calling the diversion
    just like a macro.</p>
<p class="Pp">Most of the problems arising with diversions can be avoided if you
    are conscious about the fact that diversions always deal with complete
    lines. If diversions are used when the line buffer has not been flashed,
    strange results are produced; not knowing this, many people get desperate
    about diversions. To ensure that a diversion works, line breaks should be
    added at the right places. To be on the secure side, enclose everything that
    has to do with diversions into a pair of line breaks; for example, by amply
    using <b>.br</b> requests. This rule should be applied to diversion
    definition, both inside and outside, and to all calls of diversions. This is
    a bit of overkill, but it works nicely.</p>
<p class="Pp">[If you really need diversions which should ignore the current
    partial line, use environments to save the current partial line and/or use
    the <b>.box</b> request.]</p>
<p class="Pp">The most powerful feature using diversions is to start a diversion
    within a macro definition and end it within another macro. Then everything
    between each call of this macro pair is stored within the diversion and can
    be manipulated from within the macros.</p>

All macro names must be named <i>name</i><b>.tmac</b> to fully use the tmac
  mechanism. <b>tmac.</b><i>name</i> as with classical packages is possible as
  well, but deprecated.
<p class="Pp">The macro files are kept in the <i>tmac directories</i>; a colon
    separated list of these constitutes the <i>tmac path</i>.</p>
