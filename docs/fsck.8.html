<p class="Pp">The first form of <code class="Nm">fsck</code> preens a standard
    set of filesystems or the specified filesystems. It is normally used in the
    script <span class="Pa">/etc/rc</span> during automatic reboot. Here
    <code class="Nm">fsck</code> reads the filesystem descriptor table (using
    <a class="Xr">getfsent(3)</a>) to determine which filesystems to check. Only
    partitions that have ``rw,'' ``rq'' or ``ro'' as options, and that have
    non-zero pass number are checked. Filesystems with pass number 1 (normally
    just the root filesystem) are checked one at a time. When pass 1 completes,
    all remaining filesystems are checked, running one process per disk drive.
    The disk drive containing each filesystem is inferred from the shortest
    prefix of the device name that ends in one or more digits; the remaining
    characters are assumed to be the partition designator. In preening mode,
    filesystems that are marked clean are skipped. Filesystems are marked clean
    when they are unmounted, when they have been mounted read-only, or when
    <code class="Nm">fsck</code> runs on them successfully.</p>
<p class="Pp">It should be noted that <code class="Nm">fsck</code> is now
    essentially a wrapper that invokes other <span class="Pa">fsck_XXX</span>
    utilities as needed. Currently, <code class="Nm">fsck</code> can invoke
    <span class="Pa">fsck_hfs</span>, <span class="Pa">fsck_apfs</span>,
    <span class="Pa">fsck_msdos</span>, <span class="Pa">fsck_exfat</span>, and
    <span class="Pa">fsck_udf</span>. If this underlying process that
    <code class="Nm">fsck</code> invokes encounters serious inconsistencies or
    the filesystem type is not one of the above, it exits with an abnormal
    return status and an automatic reboot will then fail. For each corrected
    inconsistency one or more lines will be printed identifying the filesystem
    on which the correction will take place, and the nature of the
  correction.</p>
<p class="Pp">If sent a <code class="Dv">QUIT</code> signal,
    <code class="Nm">fsck</code> will finish the filesystem checks, then exit
    with an abnormal return status that causes an automatic reboot to fail. This
    is useful when you want to finish the filesystem checks during an automatic
    reboot, but do not want the machine to come up multiuser after the checks
    complete.</p>
<p class="Pp">Without the <code class="Fl">-p</code> option,
    <code class="Nm">fsck</code> audits and interactively repairs inconsistent
    conditions for filesystems. It should be noted that some of the corrective
    actions which are not correctable under the <code class="Fl">-p</code>
    option will result in some loss of data. The amount and severity of data
    lost may be determined from the diagnostic output. If the operator does not
    have write permission on the filesystem <code class="Nm">fsck</code> will
    default to a <code class="Fl">-n</code> action.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following flags are interpreted by
    <code class="Nm">fsck</code> and passed along to the underlying tool that it
    spawns.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="f"><a class="permalink" href="#f"><code class="Fl">-f</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Force fsck to check `clean' filesystems when preening.</dd>
  <dt id="l"><a class="permalink" href="#l"><code class="Fl">-l</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Limit the number of parallel checks to the number specified in the
      following argument. By default, the limit is the number of disks, running
      one process per disk. If a smaller limit is given, the disks are checked
      round-robin, one filesystem at a time.</dd>
  <dt id="R"><a class="permalink" href="#R"><code class="Fl">-R</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Specify a particular passno number for which fsck is to check. You may
      only specify 1 or 2. Only those filesystems matching that particular
      passno entry (if using fstab) will be checked. For more information on the
      passno field, see <a class="Xr">fstab(5)</a>.</dd>
  <dt id="p"><a class="permalink" href="#p"><code class="Fl">-p</code></a></dt>
  <dd>&quot;Preen&quot; mode, described above.</dd>
  <dt id="q"><a class="permalink" href="#q"><code class="Fl">-q</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Do a quick check to determine if the filesystem was unmounted
    cleanly.</dd>
  <dt id="y"><a class="permalink" href="#y"><code class="Fl">-y</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Assume a yes response to all questions asked by
      <code class="Nm">fsck</code>; this should be used with great caution as
      this is a free license to continue after essentially unlimited trouble has
      been encountered.</dd>
  <dt id="n"><a class="permalink" href="#n"><code class="Fl">-n</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Assume a no response to all questions asked by
      <code class="Nm">fsck</code> except for
      &#x2018;<code class="Li">CONTINUE?</code>&#x2019;, which is assumed to be
      affirmative; do not open the filesystem for writing.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">If no filesystems are given to <code class="Nm">fsck</code> then a
    default list of filesystems is read using <a class="Xr">getfsent(3)</a>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Because of inconsistencies between the block device and the buffer
    cache, the raw device should always be used.</p>
