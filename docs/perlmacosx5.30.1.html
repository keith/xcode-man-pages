This document briefly describes Perl under Mac OS X.

<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
The latest Perl release (5.30.2 as of this writing) builds without changes under
  all versions of Mac OS X from 10.3 &quot;Panther&quot; onwards.
<p class="Pp">In order to build your own version of Perl you will need 'make',
    which is part of Apple's developer tools - also known as Xcode. From Mac OS
    X 10.7 &quot;Lion&quot; onwards, it can be downloaded separately as the
    'Command Line Tools' bundle directly from
    &lt;https://developer.apple.com/downloads/&gt; (you will need a free account
    to log in), or as a part of the Xcode suite, freely available at the App
    Store. Xcode is a pretty big app, so unless you already have it or really
    want it, you are advised to get the 'Command Line Tools' bundle separately
    from the link above. If you want to do it from within Xcode, go to Xcode
    -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Downloads and select the 'Command Line Tools'
    option.</p>
<p class="Pp">Between Mac OS X 10.3 &quot;Panther&quot; and 10.6 &quot;Snow
    Leopard&quot;, the 'Command Line Tools' bundle was called 'unix tools', and
    was usually supplied with Mac OS install DVDs.</p>
<p class="Pp">Earlier Mac OS X releases (10.2 &quot;Jaguar&quot; and older) did
    not include a completely thread-safe libc, so threading is not fully
    supported. Also, earlier releases included a buggy libdb, so some of the
    DB_File tests are known to fail on those releases.</p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="Customizations_in_Apple's_Perl"><a class="permalink" href="#Customizations_in_Apple's_Perl">Customizations
  in Apple's Perl</a></h1>
Several custom features have been added to the version of perl in Mac OS X.
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Module_Search_Path_(@INC)"><a class="permalink" href="#Module_Search_Path_(@INC)">Module
  Search Path (@INC)</a></h2>
Since 10.4 &quot;Tiger&quot;, system administrators can easily add paths to
  perl's module search path. The file '/Library/Perl/${version}/PrependToPath'
  contains paths (one per line) that will be added to the beginning of the
  search path, while the file '/Library/Perl/${version}/AppendToPath' contains
  paths that will be added to the end of the search path.
<p class="Pp">By default, Mac OS X does not come with a PrependToPath file, but
    does come with an AppendToPath file. This file contains the path
    '/System/Library/Perl/Extras/${version}', where third-party perl modules
    that Apple ships on Mac OS X, are installed. In addition, it contains the
    paths to previous versions of '/Library/Perl/${version}' (where ${version}
    are the previous versions of perl that shipped in Mac OS X), to maintain
    backwards compatibility.</p>
<p class="Pp">In 10.5 &quot;Leopard&quot; and beyond, the environment variable
    NO_PERL_PREPENDTOPATH (set to anything) will cause perl to not load any
    PrependToPath file. Likewise, the NO_PERL_APPENDTOPATH environment variable
    will case perl to not load any AppendToPath file.</p>
<p class="Pp">In 10.5.7 for versions of perl before 5.30.2, there is a new path,
    '/Library/Perl/Updates/${version}' that comes before the system perl
    directory. When 'INSTALLDIRS=perl' is specified to Makefile.PL, modules that
    previous overwrite those in '/System/Library/Perl/${version}', will now be
    install in '/Library/Perl/Updates/${version}'. This allows Apple to update
    modules in the system perl, but users will get the versions they installed
    in '/Library/Perl/Updates/${version}'.</p>
<p class="Pp">In addition, the Config parameters &quot;installprivlib&quot; and
    &quot;installarchlib&quot; now corresponds to this new directory. There are
    also the new parameters &quot;installupdateslib&quot;,
    &quot;installupdatesarch&quot;, &quot;updateslib&quot; and
    &quot;updatesarch&quot;, which also correspond to this new directory, and
    are provided for completeness.</p>
<p class="Pp">However, for perl 5.30.2 in Mac OS X 10.7, the order of the
    include paths was changed so that '/Library/Perl/5.30.2' came before
    '/System/Library/Perl/5.30.2', so '/Library/Perl/Updates' is no longer
    needed. The Config parameters &quot;installprivlib&quot; and
    &quot;installarchlib&quot; have returned to their original values, and
    &quot;installupdateslib&quot;, &quot;installupdatesarch&quot;,
    &quot;updateslib&quot; and &quot;updatesarch&quot; have been removed.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Dtrace_Support"><a class="permalink" href="#Dtrace_Support">Dtrace
  Support</a></h2>
Dtrace support has been added to perl to allow tracing of perl subroutine calls,
  both entry and return. Here is a quick example:
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    % cat test.pl
    #!/usr/bin/perl

    sub a {
        print &quot;Ah! death. Welcome to thee brother\n&quot;;
    }

    sub b {
        print &quot;Where art thou a()?\n&quot;;
        a();

<h2 class="Ss" id="64_-bit_Support"><a class="permalink" href="#64_-bit_Support">64-bit
  Support</a></h2>
Since 10.5 &quot;Leopard&quot;, Mac OS X provided both 32 and 64-bit support for
  libraries and frameworks, allowing both 32 and 64-bit applications to be
  written. While running perl (and all other command-line programs) remained
  32-bit, the 'libperl.dylib' library is 32/64 bits. This allows programs with
  embedded perl support to run in both 32 and 64-bit mode as needed.
<p class="Pp">To support this, changes to the Config module were made to return
    the correct values for the internal sizes of perl types. For example,
    &quot;longsize&quot; return 4 in 32-bits, while it returns 8 in 64-bits.</p>
<p class="Pp">Related to this support is the new environment variable ARCHFLAGS,
    which provides a way to build extensions for different machine and 32/64-bit
    architectures. The default architecture to build extensions before 10.5 was
    the (single) architecture of the building machine. In 10.5, this became
    building both 32-bit PowerPC and Intel. In 10.6 and beyond, the default
    architectures were changed to building 32-bit for both PowerPC and Intel,
    and 64-bit only for Intel. With ARCHFLAGS, this can be changed to whatever
    architectures the user wants to build. For example:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    % env ARCHFLAGS='-arch i386 -arch x86_64' perl Makefile.PL
    % make
    % make install
</pre>
<p class="Pp">will build only 2-way universal.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Multiple_Version_Support"><a class="permalink" href="#Multiple_Version_Support">Multiple
  Version Support</a></h2>
Since 10.6 &quot;SnowLeopard&quot;, more than one version of perl are supported.
  So out of the box, the default version of perl is 5.30. However, to provide
  backwards compatibility with previous versions of perl, especially for systems
  that have installed (version-specific) perl modules, or to provide newer
  versions of perl that we aren't ready to make the default, '/usr/bin/perl' can
  be switched to use an alternate version, on a per-user or system-wide basis.
  The alternate version of perl that is provided is .
<p class="Pp">Users can select the alternate version by simply running the
    following command:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    % defaults write com.apple.versioner.perl Version
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Subsequent invocations of '/usr/bin/perl' will then use the
    version.</p>
<p class="Pp">To set defaults systemwide, use the above command, but replace the
    third argument with '/Library/Preferences/com.apple.versioner.perl' (admin
    privileges will be required).</p>
<p class="Pp">The environment variable VERSIONER_PERL_VERSION (set to one of the
    supported versions) can also be set, and it overrides the settings in any
    preference files.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note: this may changes in future versions of Mac OS X, which may
    use an improved scheme for making such settings.</p>

The default installation location for this release uses the traditional UNIX
  directory layout under /usr/local. This is the recommended location for most
  users, and will leave the Apple-supplied Perl and its modules undisturbed.
<p class="Pp">Using an installation prefix of '/usr' will result in a directory
    layout that mirrors that of Apple's default Perl, with core modules stored
    in '/System/Library/Perl/${version}', CPAN modules stored in
    '/Library/Perl/${version}', and the addition of
    '/Network/Library/Perl/${version}' to <span class="Li">@INC</span> for

<h2 class="Ss" id="_s-1SDK_s0_support"><a class="permalink" href="#_s-1SDK_s0_support">SDK

First, export the path to the SDK into the build environment:
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
 export SDK=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.8.sdk
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Please make sure the SDK version (i.e. the numbers right before
    '.sdk') matches your system's (in this case, Mac OS X 10.8 &quot;Mountain
    Lion&quot;), as it is possible to have more than one SDK installed. Also
    make sure the path exists in your system, and if it doesn't please make sure
    the SDK is properly installed, as it should come with the 'Command Line
    Tools' bundle mentioned above. Finally, if you have an older Mac OS X (10.6
    &quot;Snow Leopard&quot; and below) running Xcode 4.2 or lower, the SDK path
    might be something like
    <span class="Li">'/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.3.9.sdk'</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can use the SDK by exporting some additions to Perl's
    'ccflags' and '..flags' config variables:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    ./Configure -Accflags=&quot;-nostdinc -B$SDK/usr/include/gcc \
                           -B$SDK/usr/lib/gcc -isystem$SDK/usr/include \
                           -F$SDK/System/Library/Frameworks&quot; \

<h2 class="Ss" id="Universal_Binary_support"><a class="permalink" href="#Universal_Binary_support">Universal
  Binary support</a></h2>
Note: From Mac OS X 10.6 &quot;Snow Leopard&quot; onwards, Apple only supports
  Intel-based hardware. This means you can safely skip this section unless you
  have an older Apple computer running on ppc or wish to create a perl binary
  with backwards compatibility.
<p class="Pp">You can compile perl as a universal binary (built for both ppc and
    intel). In Mac OS X 10.4 &quot;Tiger&quot;, you must export the 'u' variant
    of the SDK:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    export SDK=/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Mac OS X 10.5 &quot;Leopard&quot; and above do not require the 'u'
    variant.</p>
<p class="Pp">In addition to the compiler flags used to select the SDK, also add
    the flags for creating a universal binary:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
 ./Configure -Accflags=&quot;-arch i686 -arch ppc -nostdinc               \
                         -B$SDK/usr/include/gcc                      \
                        -B$SDK/usr/lib/gcc -isystem$SDK/usr/include  \
                        -F$SDK/System/Library/Frameworks&quot;            \
             -Aldflags=&quot;-arch i686 -arch ppc -Wl,-syslibroot,$SDK&quot;   \
             -de
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Keep in mind that these compiler and linker settings will also be
    used when building CPAN modules. For XS modules to be compiled as a
    universal binary, any libraries it links to must also be universal binaries.
    The system libraries that Apple includes with the 10.4u SDK are all
    universal, but user-installed libraries may need to be re-installed as
    universal binaries.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="64_-bit_Support_2"><a class="permalink" href="#64_-bit_Support_2">64-bit
  Support</a></h2>
Follow the instructions in <i>INSTALL</i> to build perl with support for 64-bit
  integers (<span class="Li">&quot;use64bitint&quot;</span>) or both 64-bit
  integers and 64-bit addressing
  (<span class="Li">&quot;use64bitall&quot;</span>). In the latter case, the
  resulting binary will run only on G5-based hosts.
<p class="Pp">Support for 64-bit addressing is experimental: some aspects of
    Perl may be omitted or buggy. Note the messages output by <i>Configure</i>
    for further information. Please use
    &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues&gt; to submit a problem report in
    the event that you encounter difficulties.</p>
<p class="Pp">When building 64-bit modules, it is your responsibility to ensure
    that linked external libraries and frameworks provide 64-bit support: if
    they do not, module building may appear to succeed, but attempts to use the
    module will result in run-time dynamic linking errors, and subsequent test
    failures. You can use <span class="Li">&quot;file&quot;</span> to discover
    the architectures supported by a library:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    $ file libgdbm.3.0.0.dylib 
    libgdbm.3.0.0.dylib: Mach-O fat file with 2 architectures
    libgdbm.3.0.0.dylib (for architecture ppc):      Mach-O dynamically linked shared library ppc
    libgdbm.3.0.0.dylib (for architecture ppc64):    Mach-O 64-bit dynamically linked shared library ppc64
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Note that this issue precludes the building of many
    Macintosh-specific CPAN modules
    (<span class="Li">&quot;Mac::*&quot;</span>), as the required Apple
    frameworks do not provide 64-bit support. Similarly, downloads from Fink or
    Darwinports are unlikely to provide 64-bit support; the libraries must be
    rebuilt from source with the appropriate compiler and linker flags. For
    further information, see Apple's <i>64-Bit Transition Guide</i> at
    &lt;http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Darwin/Conceptual/64bitPorting/index.html&gt;.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="libperl_and_Prebinding"><a class="permalink" href="#libperl_and_Prebinding">libperl
  and Prebinding</a></h2>
Mac OS X ships with a dynamically-loaded libperl, but the default for this
  release is to compile a static libperl. The reason for this is pre-binding.
  Dynamic libraries can be pre-bound to a specific address in memory in order to
  decrease load time. To do this, one needs to be aware of the location and size
  of all previously-loaded libraries. Apple collects this information as part of
  their overall OS build process, and thus has easy access to it when building
  Perl, but ordinary users would need to go to a great deal of effort to obtain
  the information needed for pre-binding.
<p class="Pp">You can override the default and build a shared libperl if you
    wish (Configure&#x00A0;...&#x00A0;-Duseshrplib).</p>
<p class="Pp">With Mac OS X 10.4 &quot;Tiger&quot; and newer, there is almost no
    performance penalty for non-prebound libraries. Earlier releases will suffer
    a greater load time than either the static library, or Apple's pre-bound
    dynamic library.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Updating_Apple's_Perl"><a class="permalink" href="#Updating_Apple's_Perl">Updating
  Apple's Perl</a></h2>
In a word - don't, at least not without a *very* good reason. Your scripts can
  just as easily begin with &quot;#!/usr/local/bin/perl&quot; as with
  &quot;#!/usr/bin/perl&quot;. Scripts supplied by Apple and other third parties
  as part of installation packages and such have generally only been tested with
  the /usr/bin/perl that's installed by Apple.
<p class="Pp">If you find that you do need to update the system Perl, one issue
    worth keeping in mind is the question of static vs. dynamic libraries. If
    you upgrade using the default static libperl, you will find that the dynamic
    libperl supplied by Apple will not be deleted. If both libraries are present
    when an application that links against libperl is built, ld will link
    against the dynamic library by default. So, if you need to replace Apple's
    dynamic libperl with a static libperl, you need to be sure to delete the
    older dynamic library after you've installed the update.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Known_problems"><a class="permalink" href="#Known_problems">Known
  problems</a></h2>
If you have installed extra libraries such as GDBM through Fink (in other words,
  you have libraries under <i>/sw/lib</i>), or libdlcompat to
  <i>/usr/local/lib</i>, you may need to be extra careful when running Configure
  to not to confuse Configure and Perl about which libraries to use. Being
  confused will show up for example as &quot;dyld&quot; errors about symbol
  problems, for example during &quot;make test&quot;. The safest bet is to run
  Configure as
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    Configure ... -Uloclibpth -Dlibpth=/usr/lib
</pre>
<p class="Pp">to make Configure look only into the system libraries. If you have
    some extra library directories that you really want to use (such as newer
    Berkeley DB libraries in pre-Panther systems), add those to the libpth:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    Configure ... -Uloclibpth -Dlibpth='/usr/lib /opt/lib'
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The default of building Perl statically may cause problems with
    complex applications like Tk: in that case consider building shared Perl</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    Configure ... -Duseshrplib
</pre>
<p class="Pp">but remember that there's a startup cost to pay in that case (see
    above &quot;libperl and Prebinding&quot;).</p>
<p class="Pp">Starting with Tiger (Mac OS X 10.4), Apple shipped broken locale
    files for the eu_ES locale (Basque-Spain). In previous releases of Perl,
    this resulted in failures in the <i>lib/locale</i> test. These failures have
    been suppressed in the current release of Perl by making the test ignore the
    broken locale. If you need to use the eu_ES locale, you should contact Apple
    support.</p>

There are two ways to use Cocoa from Perl. Apple's PerlObjCBridge module,

    both Foundation and AppKit classes and objects, so that full GUI

<p class="Pp">After this you can either copy Perl from your operating system
    media (you will need at least the /System/Library/Perl and /usr/bin/perl),
    or rebuild Perl from the source code with <span class="Li">&quot;Configure
    -Dprefix=/usr</span> <span class="Li">-Duseshrplib&quot;</span> NOTE: the
    <span class="Li">&quot;-Dprefix=/usr&quot;</span> to replace the system Perl
    works much better with Perl 5.8.1 and later, in Perl 5.8.0 the settings were
    not quite right.</p>
<p class="Pp">&quot;Pacifist&quot; from CharlesSoft
    (&lt;http://www.charlessoft.com/&gt;) is a nice way to extract the Perl
    binaries from the OS media, without having to reinstall the entire OS.</p>
