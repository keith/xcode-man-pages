<i>Lsof</i> revision 4.91 lists on its standard output file information about
  files opened by processes for the following UNIX dialects:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
	Apple Darwin 9 and Mac OS X 10.[567]
	FreeBSD 8.[234], 9.0 and 1[012].0 for AMD64-based systems
	Linux 2.1.72 and above for x86-based systems
	Solaris 9, 10 and 11
</pre>
<p class="Pp">(See the <b>DISTRIBUTION</b> section of this manual page for
    information on how to obtain the latest <i>lsof</i> revision.)</p>
<p class="Pp">An open file may be a regular file, a directory, a block special
    file, a character special file, an executing text reference, a library, a
    stream or a network file (Internet socket, NFS file or UNIX domain socket.)
    A specific file or all the files in a file system may be selected by
  path.</p>
<p class="Pp">Instead of a formatted display, <i>lsof</i> will produce output
    that can be parsed by other programs. See the <b>-F</b>, option description,
    and the <b>OUTPUT FOR OTHER PROGRAMS</b> section for more information.</p>
<p class="Pp">In addition to producing a single output list, <i>lsof</i> will
    run in repeat mode. In repeat mode it will produce output, delay, then
    repeat the output operation until stopped with an interrupt or quit signal.
    See the <b>+|-r</b><i> [t[m&lt;fmt&gt;]]</i> option description for more
    information.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
In the absence of any options, <i>lsof</i> lists all open files belonging to all
  active processes.
<p class="Pp">If any list request option is specified, other list requests must
    be specifically requested - e.g., if <b>-U</b> is specified for the listing
    of UNIX socket files, NFS files won't be listed unless <b>-N</b> is also
    specified; or if a user list is specified with the <b>-u</b> option, UNIX
    domain socket files, belonging to users not in the list, won't be listed
    unless the <b>-U</b> option is also specified.</p>
<p class="Pp">Normally list options that are specifically stated are ORed -
    i.e., specifying the <b>-i</b> option without an address and the
    <b>-u</b>foo option produces a listing of all network files OR files
    belonging to processes owned by user ``foo''. The exceptions are:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>1)</dt>
  <dd>the `^' (negated) login name or user ID (UID), specified with the
      <b>-u</b> option;</dd>
  <dt>2)</dt>
  <dd>the `^' (negated) process ID (PID), specified with the <b>-p</b>
    option;</dd>
  <dt>3)</dt>
  <dd>the `^' (negated) process group ID (PGID), specified with the <b>-g</b>
      option;</dd>
  <dt>4)</dt>
  <dd>the `^' (negated) command, specified with the <b>-c</b> option;</dd>
  <dt>5)</dt>
  <dd>the (`^') negated TCP or UDP protocol state names, specified with the
      <b>-s</b><i> [p:s]</i> option.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Since they represent exclusions, they are applied without ORing or
    ANDing and take effect before any other selection criteria are applied.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>-a</b> option may be used to AND the selections. For
    example, specifying <b>-a</b>, <b>-U</b>, and <b>-u</b>foo produces a
    listing of only UNIX socket files that belong to processes owned by user
    ``foo''.</p>
<p class="Pp">Caution: the <b>-a</b> option causes all list selection options to
    be ANDed; it can't be used to cause ANDing of selected pairs of selection
    options by placing it between them, even though its placement there is
    acceptable. Wherever <b>-a</b> is placed, it causes the ANDing of all
    selection options.</p>
<p class="Pp">Items of the same selection set - command names, file descriptors,
    network addresses, process identifiers, user identifiers, zone names,
    security contexts - are joined in a single ORed set and applied before the
    result participates in ANDing. Thus, for example, specifying
    <b>-i</b>@aaa.bbb, <b>-i</b>@ccc.ddd, <b>-a</b>, and <b>-u</b>fff,ggg will
    select the listing of files that belong to either login ``fff'' OR ``ggg''
    AND have network connections to either host aaa.bbb OR ccc.ddd.</p>
<p class="Pp">Options may be grouped together following a single prefix -- e.g.,
    the option set ``<b>-a -b -C</b>'' may be stated as <b>-abC</b>. However,
    since values are optional following <b>+|-f</b>, <b>-F</b>, <b>-g</b>,
    <b>-i</b>, <b>+|-L</b>, <b>-o</b>, <b>+|-r</b>, <b>-s</b>, <b>-S</b>,
    <b>-T</b>, <b>-x</b> and <b>-z</b>. when you have no values for them be
    careful that the following character isn't ambiguous. For example,
    <b>-Fn</b> might represent the <b>-F</b> and <b>-n</b> options, or it might
    represent the <b>n</b> field identifier character following the <b>-F</b>
    option. When ambiguity is possible, start a new option with a `-' character
    - e.g., ``<b>-F -n</b>''. If the next option is a file name, follow the
    possibly ambiguous option with ``--'' - e.g., ``<b>-F --
  </b><i>name</i>''.</p>
<p class="Pp">Either the `+' or the `-' prefix may be applied to a group of
    options. Options that don't take on separate meanings for each prefix -
    e.g., <b>-i</b> - may be grouped under either prefix. Thus, for example,
    ``+M -i'' may be stated as ``+Mi'' and the group means the same as the
    separate options. Be careful of prefix grouping when one or more options in
    the group does take on separate meanings under different prefixes - e.g.,
    <b>+|-M</b>; ``-iM'' is not the same request as ``-i +M''. When in doubt,
    use separate options with appropriate prefixes.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>-? -h</b></dt>
  <dd>These two equivalent options select a usage (help) output list.
      <i>Lsof</i> displays a shortened form of this output when it detects an

  <dt><b>-A</b><i> A</i></dt>
  <dd>is available on systems configured for AFS whose AFS kernel code is

  <dt></dt>
  <dd>If <i>c</i> begins and ends with a slash ('/'), the characters between the
      slashes are interpreted as a regular expression. Shell meta-characters in
      the regular expression must be quoted to prevent their interpretation by
      the shell. The closing slash may be followed by these modifiers:</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>
    <pre>
	b	the regular expression is a basic one.

  <dt></dt>
  <dd>The simple command specification is tested first. If that test fails, the
      command regular expression is applied. If the simple command test
      succeeds, the command regular expression test isn't made. This may result
      in ``no command found for regex:'' messages when lsof's <b>-V</b> option
      is specified.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Note that many UNIX dialects do not supply all command name characters to
      <i>lsof</i> in the files and structures from which <i>lsof</i> obtains
      command name. Often dialects limit the number of characters supplied in
      those sources. For example, Linux 2.4.27 and Solaris 9 both limit command
      name length to 16 characters.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>If <i>w</i> is zero ('0'), all command characters supplied to <i>lsof</i>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>-d</b><i> s</i></dt>
  <dd>specifies a list of file descriptors (FDs) to exclude from or include in
      the output listing. The file descriptors are specified in the
      comma-separated set <i>s</i> - e.g., ``cwd,1,3'', ``^6,^2''. (There should

      and all the files and directories it contains to its complete depth.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Processing of the <b>+D</b> option does not follow symbolic links within

  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Note: the authority of the user of this option limits it to searching for
      files that the user has permission to examine with the system
      <i>stat</i>(2) function.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Further note: <i>lsof</i> may process this option slowly and require a
      large amount of dynamic memory to do it. This is because it must descend
      the entire directory tree, rooted at <i>D</i>, calling <i>stat</i>(2) for
      each file and directory, building a list of all the files it finds, and
      searching that list for a match with every open file. When directory
      <i>D</i> is large, these steps can take a long time, so use this option
      prudently.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>-D</b><i> D</i></dt>
  <dd>directs <i>lsof's</i> use of the device cache file. The use of this option
      is sometimes restricted. See the <b>DEVICE CACHE FILE</b> section and the
      sections that follow it for more information on this option.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd><b>-D</b> must be followed by a function letter; the function letter may
      optionally be followed by a path name. <i>Lsof</i> recognizes these
      function letters:</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>
    <pre>
	<b>?</b> - report device cache file paths
	<b>b</b> - build the device cache file
	<b>i</b> - ignore the device cache file
	<b>r</b> - read the device cache file
	<b>u</b> - read and update the device cache file
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>The <b>b</b>, <b>r</b>, and <b>u</b> functions, accompanied by a path
      name, are sometimes restricted. When these functions are restricted, they
      will not appear in the description of the <b>-D</b> option that
      accompanies <b>-h</b> or <b>-?</b> option output. See the <b>DEVICE CACHE
      FILE</b> section and the sections that follow it for more information on
      these functions and when they're restricted.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>The <b>?</b> function reports the read-only and write paths that lsof can
      use for the device cache file, the names of any environment variables
      whose values <i>lsof</i> will examine when forming the device cache file
      path, and the format for the personal device cache file path. (Escape the
      `?' character as your shell requires.)</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>When available, the <b>b</b>, <b>r</b>, and <b>u</b> functions may be
      followed by the device cache file's path. The standard default is
      <i>.lsof_hostname</i> in the home directory of the real user ID that
      executes <i>lsof</i>, but this could have been changed when <i>lsof</i>
      was configured and compiled. (The output of the <b>-h</b> and <b>-?</b>
      options show the current default prefix - e.g., ``.lsof''.) The suffix,
      <i>hostname</i>, is the first component of the host's name returned by
      <i>gethostname</i>(2).</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>When available, the <b>b</b> function directs <i>lsof</i> to build a new
      device cache file at the default or specified path.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>The <b>i</b> function directs <i>lsof</i> to ignore the default device
      cache file and obtain its information about devices via direct calls to
      the kernel.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>The <b>r</b> function directs <i>lsof</i> to read the device cache at the
      default or specified path, but prevents it from creating a new device
      cache file when none exists or the existing one is improperly structured.
      The <b>r</b> function, when specified without a path name, prevents
      <i>lsof</i> from updating an incorrect or outdated device cache file, or
      creating a new one in its place. The <b>r</b> function is always available
      when it is specified without a path name argument; it may be restricted by
      the permissions of the <i>lsof</i> process.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>When available, the <b>u</b> function directs <i>lsof</i> to read the
      device cache file at the default or specified path, if possible, and to
      rebuild it, if necessary. This is the default device cache file function
      when no <b>-D</b> option has been specified.</dd>

      <i>stat</i>(2), <i>lstat</i>(2) and most <i>readlink</i>(2) kernel
      function calls. The <b>-e</b> option exempts only <i>stat(2)</i> and
      <i>lstat</i>(2) kernel function calls. Multiple file systems may be

  <dd>This option is currently implemented only for Linux.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd><b>CAUTION:</b> this option can easily be mis-applied to other than the
      file system of interest, because it uses path name rather than the more
      reliable device and inode numbers. (Device and inode numbers are acquired
      via the potentially blocking <i>stat</i>(2) kernel call and are thus not
      available, but see the <b>+|-m</b><i> m</i> option as a possible
      alternative way to supply device numbers.) <b>Use this option with great

  <dd>When <b>-f</b> is specified by itself, all path name arguments will be

      all open files in the `/' (root) file system.</dd>

      that filter at the process level - e.g., <b>-c</b>, <b>-g</b>, <b>-p</b>,

  <dt></dt>
  <dd>When the optional form is available, the <b>s</b> may be followed by a
      protocol name (<i>p</i>), either TCP or UDP, a colon (`:') and a

      UDP files to be excluded if their state name(s) are in the list (<i>s</i>)
      preceded by a `^'; or included if their name(s) are not preceded by a

  <dt></dt>
  <dd>When an inclusion list is defined, only network files with state names in
      the list will be present in the <i>lsof</i> output. Thus, specifying one
      state name means that only network files with that lone state name will be
      listed.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Case is unimportant in the protocol or state names, but there may be no
      spaces and the colon (`:') separating the protocol name (<i>p</i>) and the
      state name list (<i>s</i>) is required.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>If only TCP and UDP files are to be listed, as controlled by the specified
      exclusions and inclusions, the <b>-i</b> option must be specified, too. If
      only a single protocol's files are to be listed, add its name as an
      argument to the <b>-i</b> option.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>For example, to list only network files with TCP state LISTEN, use:</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>
    <pre>
	-iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN
    </pre>
  </dd>

  <dd>
    <pre>
	-iUDP -sUDP:Idle
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>State names vary with UNIX dialects, so it's not possible to provide a
      complete list. Some common TCP state names are: CLOSED, IDLE, BOUND,
      LISTEN, ESTABLISHED, SYN_SENT, SYN_RCDV, ESTABLISHED, CLOSE_WAIT,
      FIN_WAIT1, CLOSING, LAST_ACK, FIN_WAIT_2, and TIME_WAIT. Two common UDP

      completely that it can neither be killed nor stopped. I have never seen
      this happen or had a report of its happening, but I think there is a
      remote possibility it could happen.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>By default use of readx() is disabled. On AIX 5L and above <i>lsof</i> may
      need setuid-root permission to perform the actions this option
    requests.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>The <i>lsof</i> builder may specify that the <b>-X</b> option be
      restricted to processes whose real UID is root. If that has been done, the
      <b>-X</b> option will not appear in the <b>-h</b> or <b>-?</b> help output
      unless the real UID of the <i>lsof</i> process is root. The default
      <i>lsof</i> distribution allows any UID to specify <b>-X,</b> so by
      default it will appear in the help output.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>When AIX readx() use is disabled, <i>lsof</i> may not be able to report
      information for all text and loader file references, but it may also avoid
      exacerbating an AIX kernel directory search kernel error, known as the
      Stale Segment ID bug.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>The readx() function, used by <i>lsof</i> or any other program to access
      some sections of kernel virtual memory, can trigger the Stale Segment ID
      bug. It can cause the kernel's dir_search() function to believe
      erroneously that part of an in-memory copy of a file system directory has
      been zeroed. Another application process, distinct from <i>lsof</i>,
      asking the kernel to search the directory - e.g., by using <i>open</i>(2)
      - can cause dir_search() to loop forever, thus hanging the application
      process.</dd>

      obtain the device and node numbers of both the absolute path in
      <i>/proc/net/unix</i> and <i>name</i> via successful <i>stat</i>(2) system
      calls. When those conditions are met, <i>lsof</i> will be able to search
      for the UNIX domain socket when some path to it is is specified in

<i>Lsof</i> supports the recognition of AFS files for these dialects (and AFS
  versions):
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
	AIX 4.1.4 (AFS 3.4a)
	HP-UX 9.0.5 (AFS 3.4a)
	Linux 1.2.13 (AFS 3.3)
	Solaris 2.[56] (AFS 3.4a)
</pre>
<p class="Pp">It may recognize AFS files on other versions of these dialects,
    but has not been tested there. Depending on how AFS is implemented,
    <i>lsof</i> may recognize AFS files in other dialects, or may have
    difficulties recognizing AFS files in the supported dialects.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Lsof</i> may have trouble identifying all aspects of AFS files
    in supported dialects when AFS kernel support is implemented via dynamic
    modules whose addresses do not appear in the kernel's variable name list. In
    that case, <i>lsof</i> may have to guess at the identity of AFS files, and
    might not be able to obtain volume information from the kernel that is
    needed for calculating AFS volume node numbers. When <i>lsof</i> can't
    compute volume node numbers, it reports blank in the NODE column.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>-A</b><i> A</i> option is available in some dialect
    implementations of <i>lsof</i> for specifying the name list file where
    dynamic module kernel addresses may be found. When this option is available,
    it will be listed in the <i>lsof</i> help output, presented in response to
    the <b>-h</b> or <b>-?</b></p>
<p class="Pp">See the <i>lsof</i> FAQ (The <b>FAQ</b> section gives its
    location.) for more information about dynamic modules, their symbols, and
    how they affect <i>lsof</i> options.</p>
<p class="Pp">Because AFS path lookups don't seem to participate in the kernel's
    name cache operations, <i>lsof</i> can't identify path name components for
    AFS files.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="SECURITY"><a class="permalink" href="#SECURITY">SECURITY</a></h1>
<i>Lsof</i> has three features that may cause security concerns. First, its
  default compilation mode allows anyone to list all open files with it. Second,
  by default it creates a user-readable and user-writable device cache file in
  the home directory of the real user ID that executes <i>lsof</i>. (The
  list-all-open-files and device cache features may be disabled when <i>lsof</i>
  is compiled.) Third, its <b>-k</b> and <b>-m</b> options name alternate kernel
  name list or memory files.
<p class="Pp">Restricting the listing of all open files is controlled by the
    compile-time HASSECURITY and HASNOSOCKSECURITY options. When HASSECURITY is
    defined, <i>lsof</i> will allow only the root user to list all open files.
    The non-root user may list only open files of processes with the same user
    IDentification number as the real user ID number of the <i>lsof</i> process
    (the one that its user logged on with).</p>
<p class="Pp">However, if HASSECURITY and HASNOSOCKSECURITY are both defined,
    anyone may list open socket files, provided they are selected with the
    <b>-i</b> option.</p>
<p class="Pp">When HASSECURITY is not defined, anyone may list all open
  files.</p>
<p class="Pp">Help output, presented in response to the <b>-h</b> or <b>-?</b>
    option, gives the status of the HASSECURITY and HASNOSOCKSECURITY
    definitions.</p>
<p class="Pp">See the <b>Security</b> section of the <i>00README</i> file of the
    <i>lsof</i> distribution for information on building <i>lsof</i> with the
    HASSECURITY and HASNOSOCKSECURITY options enabled.</p>
<p class="Pp">Creation and use of a user-readable and user-writable device cache
    file is controlled by the compile-time HASDCACHE option. See the <b>DEVICE
    CACHE FILE</b> section and the sections that follow it for details on how
    its path is formed. For security considerations it is important to note that
    in the default <i>lsof</i> distribution, if the real user ID under which
    <i>lsof</i> is executed is root, the device cache file will be written in
    root's home directory - e.g., <i>/</i> or <i>/root</i>. When HASDCACHE is
    not defined, <i>lsof</i> does not write or attempt to read a device cache
    file.</p>
<p class="Pp">When HASDCACHE is defined, the <i>lsof</i> help output, presented
    in response to the <b>-h</b>, <b>-D?</b>, or <b>-?</b> options, will provide
    device cache file handling information. When HASDCACHE is not defined, the
    <b>-h</b> or <b>-?</b> output will have no <b>-D</b> option description.</p>
<p class="Pp">Before you decide to disable the device cache file feature -
    enabling it improves the performance of <i>lsof</i> by reducing the startup
    overhead of examining all the nodes in <i>/dev</i> (or <i>/devices</i>) -
    read the discussion of it in the <i>00DCACHE</i> file of the <i>lsof</i>
    distribution and the <i>lsof</i> FAQ (The <b>FAQ</b> section gives its
    location.)</p>
<p class="Pp">WHEN IN DOUBT, YOU CAN TEMPORARILY DISABLE THE USE OF THE DEVICE
    CACHE FILE WITH THE <b>-Di</b> OPTION.</p>
<p class="Pp">When <i>lsof</i> user declares alternate kernel name list or
    memory files with the <b>-k</b> and <b>-m</b> options, <i>lsof</i> checks
    the user's authority to read them with <i>access</i>(2). This is intended to
    prevent whatever special power <i>lsof's</i> modes might confer on it from
    letting it read files not normally accessible via the authority of the real
    user ID.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="OUTPUT"><a class="permalink" href="#OUTPUT">OUTPUT</a></h1>
This section describes the information <i>lsof</i> lists for each open file. See
  the <b>OUTPUT FOR OTHER PROGRAMS</b> section for additional information on
  output that can be processed by another program.
<p class="Pp"><i>Lsof</i> only outputs printable (declared so by
    <i>isprint</i>(3)) 8 bit characters. Non-printable characters are printed in
    one of three forms: the C ``\[bfrnt]'' form; the control character `^' form
    (e.g., ``^@''); or hexadecimal leading ``\x'' form (e.g., ``\xab''). Space
    is non-printable in the COMMAND column (``\x20'') and printable
  elsewhere.</p>
<p class="Pp">For some dialects - if HASSETLOCALE is defined in the dialect's
    machine.h header file - <i>lsof</i> will print the extended 8 bit characters
    of a language locale. The <i>lsof</i> process must be supplied a language
    locale environment variable (e.g., LANG) whose value represents a known
    language locale in which the extended characters are considered printable by
    <i>isprint</i>(3). Otherwise <i>lsof</i> considers the extended characters
    non-printable and prints them according to its rules for non-printable
    characters, stated above. Consult your dialect's <i>setlocale</i>(3) man
    page for the names of other environment variables that may be used in place
    of LANG - e.g., LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, etc.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Lsof's</i> language locale support for a dialect also covers
    wide characters - e.g., UTF-8 - when HASSETLOCALE and HASWIDECHAR are
    defined in the dialect's machine.h header file, and when a suitable language
    locale has been defined in the appropriate environment variable for the
    <i>lsof</i> process. Wide characters are printable under those conditions if
    <i>iswprint</i>(3) reports them to be. If HASSETLOCALE, HASWIDECHAR and a
    suitable language locale aren't defined, or if <i>iswprint</i>(3) reports
    wide characters that aren't printable, <i>lsof</i> considers the wide
    characters non-printable and prints each of their 8 bits according to its
    rules for non-printable characters, stated above.</p>
<p class="Pp">Consult the answers to the &quot;Language locale support&quot;
    questions in the lsof FAQ (The <b>FAQ</b> section gives its location.) for
    more information.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Lsof</i> dynamically sizes the output columns each time it
    runs, guaranteeing that each column is a minimum size. It also guarantees
    that each column is separated from its predecessor by at least one
  space.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">

      characters of the name of the UNIX command associated with the process up
      to the limit of characters supplied to <i>lsof</i> by the UNIX dialect.

      value reported by <i>ps</i>(1), but may differ when the process has

  <dd>On some UNIX dialects <i>lsof</i> can't obtain accurate or consistent file

      particular kinds of files (e.g., socket files.) In other cases, files
      don't have true sizes - e.g., sockets, FIFOs, pipes - so <i>lsof</i>
      displays for their sizes the content amounts it finds in their kernel

      sizes.) Consult the <i>lsof</i> FAQ (The <b>FAQ</b> section gives its

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="LOCKS"><a class="permalink" href="#LOCKS">LOCKS</a></h1>
<i>Lsof</i> can't adequately report the wide variety of UNIX dialect file locks
  in a single character. What it reports in a single character is a compromise
  between the information it finds in the kernel and the limitations of the
  reporting format.
<p class="Pp">Moreover, when a process holds several byte level locks on a file,
    <i>lsof</i> only reports the status of the first lock it encounters. If it
    is a byte level lock, then the lock character will be reported in lower case
    - i.e., `r', `w', or `x' - rather than the upper case equivalent reported
    for a full file lock.</p>
<p class="Pp">Generally <i>lsof</i> can only report on locks held by local
    processes on local files. When a local process sets a lock on a remotely
    mounted (e.g., NFS) file, the remote server host usually records the lock
    state. One exception is Solaris - at some patch levels of 2.3, and in all
    versions above 2.4, the Solaris kernel records information on remote locks
    in local structures.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Lsof</i> has trouble reporting locks for some UNIX dialects.
    Consult the <b>BUGS</b> section of this manual page or the <i>lsof</i> FAQ
    (The <b>FAQ</b> section gives its location.) for more information.</p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="OUTPUT_FOR_OTHER_PROGRAMS"><a class="permalink" href="#OUTPUT_FOR_OTHER_PROGRAMS">OUTPUT
  FOR OTHER PROGRAMS</a></h1>
When the <b>-F</b> option is specified, <i>lsof</i> produces output that is
  suitable for processing by another program - e.g, an <i>awk</i> or <i>Perl</i>
  script, or a C program.
<p class="Pp">Each unit of information is output in a field that is identified
    with a leading character and terminated by a NL (012) (or a NUL (000) if the
    0 (zero) field identifier character is specified.) The data of the field
    follows immediately after the field identification character and extends to
    the field terminator.</p>
<p class="Pp">It is possible to think of field output as process and file sets.
    A process set begins with a field whose identifier is `p' (for process
    IDentifier (PID)). It extends to the beginning of the next PID field or the
    beginning of the first file set of the process, whichever comes first.
    Included in the process set are fields that identify the command, the
    process group IDentification (PGID) number, the task (thread) ID (TID), and
    the user ID (UID) number or login name.</p>
<p class="Pp">A file set begins with a field whose identifier is `f' (for file
    descriptor). It is followed by lines that describe the file's access mode,
    lock state, type, device, size, offset, inode, protocol, name and stream
    module names. It extends to the beginning of the next file or process set,
    whichever comes first.</p>
<p class="Pp">When the NUL (000) field terminator has been selected with the 0
    (zero) field identifier character, <i>lsof</i> ends each process and file
    set with a NL (012) character.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Lsof</i> always produces one field, the PID (`p') field. All
    other fields may be declared optionally in the field identifier character
    list that follows the <b>-F</b> option. When a field selection character
    identifies an item <i>lsof</i> does not normally list - e.g., PPID, selected
    with <b>-R</b> - specification of the field character - e.g., ``<b>-FR</b>''
    - also selects the listing of the item.</p>
<p class="Pp">It is entirely possible to select a set of fields that cannot
    easily be parsed - e.g., if the field descriptor field is not selected, it
    may be difficult to identify file sets. To help you avoid this difficulty,
    <i>lsof</i> supports the <b>-F</b> option; it selects the output of all
    fields with NL terminators (the <b>-F0</b> option pair selects the output of
    all fields with NUL terminators). For compatibility reasons neither
    <b>-F</b> nor <b>-F0</b> select the raw device field.</p>
<p class="Pp">These are the fields that <i>lsof</i> will produce. The single
    character listed first is the field identifier.</p>

<p class="Pp">You can get on-line help information on these characters and their
    descriptions by specifying the <b>-F?</b> option pair. (Escape the `?'
    character as your shell requires.) Additional information on field content
    can be found in the <b>OUTPUT</b> section.</p>
<p class="Pp">As an example, ``<b>-F pcfn</b>'' will select the process ID
    (`p'), command name (`c'), file descriptor (`f') and file name (`n') fields
    with an NL field terminator character; ``<b>-F pcfn0</b>'' selects the same
    output with a NUL (000) field terminator character.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Lsof</i> doesn't produce all fields for every process or file
    set, only those that are available. Some fields are mutually exclusive: file
    device characters and file major/minor device numbers; file inode number and
    protocol name; file name and stream identification; file size and offset.
    One or the other member of these mutually exclusive sets will appear in
    field output, but not both.</p>
<p class="Pp">Normally <i>lsof</i> ends each field with a NL (012) character.
    The 0 (zero) field identifier character may be specified to change the field
    terminator character to a NUL (000). A NUL terminator may be easier to
    process with <i>xargs (1),</i> for example, or with programs whose quoting
    mechanisms may not easily cope with the range of characters in the field
    output. When the NUL field terminator is in use, <i>lsof</i> ends each
    process and file set with a NL (012).</p>
<p class="Pp">Three aids to producing programs that can process <i>lsof</i>
    field output are included in the <i>lsof</i> distribution. The first is a C
    header file, <i>lsof_fields.h</i>, that contains symbols for the field
    identification characters, indexes for storing them in a table, and
    explanation strings that may be compiled into programs. <i>Lsof</i> uses
    this header file.</p>
<p class="Pp">The second aid is a set of sample scripts that process field
    output, written in <i>awk</i>, <i>Perl</i> 4, and <i>Perl</i> 5. They're
    located in the <i>scripts</i> subdirectory of the <i>lsof</i>
  distribution.</p>
<p class="Pp">The third aid is the C library used for the <i>lsof</i> test
    suite. The test suite is written in C and uses field output to validate the
    correct operation of <i>lsof</i>. The library can be found in the
    <i>tests/LTlib.c</i> file of the <i>lsof</i> distribution. The library uses
    the first aid, the <i>lsof_fields.h</i> header file.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="BLOCKS_AND_TIMEOUTS"><a class="permalink" href="#BLOCKS_AND_TIMEOUTS">BLOCKS
  AND TIMEOUTS</a></h1>
<i>Lsof</i> can be blocked by some kernel functions that it uses -
  <i>lstat</i>(2), <i>readlink</i>(2), and <i>stat</i>(2). These functions are
  stalled in the kernel, for example, when the hosts where mounted NFS file
  systems reside become inaccessible.
<p class="Pp"><i>Lsof</i> attempts to break these blocks with timers and child
    processes, but the techniques are not wholly reliable. When <i>lsof</i> does
    manage to break a block, it will report the break with an error message. The
    messages may be suppressed with the <b>-t</b> and <b>-w</b> options.</p>
<p class="Pp">The default timeout value may be displayed with the <b>-h</b> or
    <b>-?</b> option, and it may be changed with the <b>-S</b><i> [t]</i>
    option. The minimum for <i>t</i> is two seconds, but you should avoid small
    values, since slow system responsiveness can cause short timeouts to expire
    unexpectedly and perhaps stop <i>lsof</i> before it can produce any
  output.</p>
<p class="Pp">When <i>lsof</i> has to break a block during its access of mounted
    file system information, it normally continues, although with less
    information available to display about open files.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Lsof</i> can also be directed to avoid the protection of timers
    and child processes when using the kernel functions that might block by
    specifying the <b>-O</b> option. While this will allow <i>lsof</i> to start
    up with less overhead, it exposes <i>lsof</i> completely to the kernel
    situations that might block it. Use this option cautiously.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="AVOIDING_KERNEL_BLOCKS"><a class="permalink" href="#AVOIDING_KERNEL_BLOCKS">AVOIDING
  KERNEL BLOCKS</a></h1>
You can use the <b>-b</b> option to tell <i>lsof</i> to avoid using kernel
  functions that would block. Some cautions apply.
<p class="Pp">First, using this option usually requires that your system supply
    alternate device numbers in place of the device numbers that <i>lsof</i>
    would normally obtain with the <i>lstat</i>(2) and <i>stat</i>(2) kernel
    functions. See the <b>ALTERNATE DEVICE NUMBERS</b> section for more
    information on alternate device numbers.</p>
<p class="Pp">Second, you can't specify <i>names</i> for <i>lsof</i> to locate
    unless they're file system names. This is because <i>lsof</i> needs to know
    the device and inode numbers of files listed with <i>names</i> in the
    <i>lsof</i> options, and the <b>-b</b> option prevents <i>lsof</i> from
    obtaining them. Moreover, since <i>lsof</i> only has device numbers for the
    file systems that have alternates, its ability to locate files on file
    systems depends completely on the availability and accuracy of the
    alternates. If no alternates are available, or if they're incorrect,
    <i>lsof</i> won't be able to locate files on the named file systems.</p>
<p class="Pp">Third, if the names of your file system directories that
    <i>lsof</i> obtains from your system's mount table are symbolic links,
    <i>lsof</i> won't be able to resolve the links. This is because the
    <b>-b</b> option causes <i>lsof</i> to avoid the kernel <i>readlink</i>(2)
    function it uses to resolve symbolic links.</p>
<p class="Pp">Finally, using the <b>-b</b> option causes <i>lsof</i> to issue
    warning messages when it needs to use the kernel functions that the
    <b>-b</b> option directs it to avoid. You can suppress these messages by
    specifying the <b>-w</b> option, but if you do, you won't see the alternate
    device numbers reported in the warning messages.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="ALTERNATE_DEVICE_NUMBERS"><a class="permalink" href="#ALTERNATE_DEVICE_NUMBERS">ALTERNATE
  DEVICE NUMBERS</a></h1>
On some dialects, when <i>lsof</i> has to break a block because it can't get
  information about a mounted file system via the <i>lstat</i>(2) and
  <i>stat</i>(2) kernel functions, or because you specified the <b>-b</b>
  option, <i>lsof</i> can obtain some of the information it needs - the device
  number and possibly the file system type - from the system mount table. When
  that is possible, <i>lsof</i> will report the device number it obtained. (You
  can suppress the report by specifying the <b>-w</b> option.)
<p class="Pp">You can assist this process if your mount table is supported with
    an <i>/etc/mtab</i> or <i>/etc/mnttab</i> file that contains an options
    field by adding a ``dev=xxxx'' field for mount points that do not have one
    in their options strings. Note: you must be able to edit the file - i.e.,
    some mount tables like recent Solaris /etc/mnttab or Linux /proc/mounts are
    read-only and can't be modified.</p>
<p class="Pp">You may also be able to supply device numbers using the <b>+m</b>
    and <b>+m</b><i> m</i> options, provided they are supported by your dialect.
    Check the output of <i>lsof's</i> <b>-h</b> or <b>-?</b> options to see if
    the <b>+m</b> and <b>+m</b><i> m</i> options are available.</p>
<p class="Pp">The ``xxxx'' portion of the field is the hexadecimal value of the
    file system's device number. (Consult the <i>st_dev</i> field of the output
    of the <i>lstat</i>(2) and <i>stat</i>(2) functions for the appropriate
    values for your file systems.) Here's an example from a Sun Solaris 2.6
    <i>/etc/mnttab</i> for a file system remotely mounted via NFS:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
	nfs  ignore,noquota,dev=2a40001
</pre>
<p class="Pp">There's an advantage to having ``dev=xxxx'' entries in your mount
    table file, especially for file systems that are mounted from remote NFS
    servers. When a remote server crashes and you want to identify its users by
    running <i>lsof</i> on one of its clients, <i>lsof</i> probably won't be
    able to get output from the <i>lstat</i>(2) and <i>stat</i>(2) functions for
    the file system. If it can obtain the file system's device number from the
    mount table, it will be able to display the files open on the crashed NFS
    server.</p>
<p class="Pp">Some dialects that do not use an ASCII <i>/etc/mtab</i> or
    <i>/etc/mnttab</i> file for the mount table may still provide an alternative
    device number in their internal mount tables. This includes AIX, Apple
    Darwin, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, and Tru64 UNIX. <i>Lsof</i> knows how to
    obtain the alternative device number for these dialects and uses it when its
    attempt to <i>lstat</i>(2) or <i>stat</i>(2) the file system is blocked.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you're not sure your dialect supplies alternate device numbers
    for file systems from its mount table, use this <i>lsof</i> incantation to
    see if it reports any alternate device numbers:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>lsof -b</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Look for standard error file warning messages that begin
    ``assuming &quot;dev=xxxx&quot; from ...''.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="KERNEL_NAME_CACHE"><a class="permalink" href="#KERNEL_NAME_CACHE">KERNEL
  NAME CACHE</a></h1>
<i>Lsof</i> is able to examine the kernel's name cache or use other kernel
  facilities (e.g., the ADVFS 4.x tag_to_path() function under Tru64 UNIX) on
  some dialects for most file system types, excluding AFS, and extract recently
  used path name components from it. (AFS file system path lookups don't use the
  kernel's name cache; some Solaris VxFS file system operations apparently don't
  use it, either.)
<p class="Pp"><i>Lsof</i> reports the complete paths it finds in the NAME
    column. If <i>lsof</i> can't report all components in a path, it reports in
    the NAME column the file system name, followed by a space, two `-'
    characters, another space, and the name components it has located, separated
    by the `/' character.</p>
<p class="Pp">When <i>lsof</i> is run in repeat mode - i.e., with the <b>-r</b>
    option specified - the extent to which it can report path name components
    for the same file may vary from cycle to cycle. That's because other running
    processes can cause the kernel to remove entries from its name cache and
    replace them with others.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Lsof's</i> use of the kernel name cache to identify the paths
    of files can lead it to report incorrect components under some
    circumstances. This can happen when the kernel name cache uses device and
    node number as a key (e.g., SCO OpenServer) and a key on a rapidly changing
    file system is reused. If the UNIX dialect's kernel doesn't purge the name
    cache entry for a file when it is unlinked, <i>lsof</i> may find a reference
    to the wrong entry in the cache. The <i>lsof</i> FAQ (The <b>FAQ</b> section
    gives its location.) has more information on this situation.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Lsof</i> can report path name components for these

<h1 class="Sh" id="DEVICE_CACHE_FILE"><a class="permalink" href="#DEVICE_CACHE_FILE">DEVICE
  CACHE FILE</a></h1>
Examining all members of the <i>/dev</i> (or <i>/devices</i>) node tree with
  <i>stat</i>(2) functions can be time consuming. What's more, the information
  that <i>lsof</i> needs - device number, inode number, and path - rarely
  changes.
<p class="Pp">Consequently, <i>lsof</i> normally maintains an ASCII text file of
    cached <i>/dev</i> (or <i>/devices</i>) information (exception: the
    /proc-based Linux <i>lsof</i> where it's not needed.) The local system
    administrator who builds <i>lsof</i> can control the way the device cache
    file path is formed, selecting from these options:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
	Path from the <b>-D</b> option;
	Path from an environment variable;
	System-wide path;
	Personal path (the default);
	Personal path, modified by an environment variable.
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Consult the output of the <b>-h</b>, <b>-D? ,</b> or <b>-?</b>
    help options for the current state of device cache support. The help output
    lists the default read-mode device cache file path that is in effect for the
    current invocation of <i>lsof</i>. The <b>-D?</b> option output lists the
    read-only and write device cache file paths, the names of any applicable
    environment variables, and the personal device cache path format.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Lsof</i> can detect that the current device cache file has been
    accidentally or maliciously modified by integrity checks, including the
    computation and verification of a sixteen bit Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)
    sum on the file's contents. When <i>lsof</i> senses something wrong with the
    file, it issues a warning and attempts to remove the current cache file and
    create a new copy, but only to a path that the process can legitimately
    write.</p>
<p class="Pp">The path from which a <i>lsof</i> process may attempt to read a
    device cache file may not be the same as the path to which it can
    legitimately write. Thus when <i>lsof</i> senses that it needs to update the
    device cache file, it may choose a different path for writing it from the
    path from which it read an incorrect or outdated version.</p>
<p class="Pp">If available, the <b>-Dr</b> option will inhibit the writing of a
    new device cache file. (It's always available when specified without a path
    name argument.)</p>
<p class="Pp">When a new device is added to the system, the device cache file
    may need to be recreated. Since <i>lsof</i> compares the mtime of the device
    cache file with the mtime and ctime of the <i>/dev</i> (or <i>/devices</i>)
    directory, it usually detects that a new device has been added; in that case
    <i>lsof</i> issues a warning message and attempts to rebuild the device
    cache file.</p>
<p class="Pp">Whenever <i>lsof</i> writes a device cache file, it sets its
    ownership to the real UID of the executing process, and its permission modes
    to 0600, this restricting its reading and writing to the file's owner.</p>

  PERMISSIONS THAT AFFECT DEVICE CACHE FILE ACCESS</a></h1>
Two permissions of the <i>lsof</i> executable affect its ability to access
  device cache files. The permissions are set by the local system administrator
  when <i>lsof</i> is installed.
<p class="Pp">The first and rarer permission is setuid-root. It comes into
    effect when <i>lsof</i> is executed; its effective UID is then root, while
    its real (i.e., that of the logged-on user) UID is not. The <i>lsof</i>
    distribution recommends that versions for these dialects run
  setuid-root.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
	HP-UX 11.11 and 11.23
	Linux
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The second and more common permission is setgid. It comes into
    effect when the effective group IDentification number (GID) of the
    <i>lsof</i> process is set to one that can access kernel memory devices -
    e.g., ``kmem'', ``sys'', or ``system''.</p>
<p class="Pp">An <i>lsof</i> process that has setgid permission usually
    surrenders the permission after it has accessed the kernel memory devices.
    When it does that, <i>lsof</i> can allow more liberal device cache path
    formations. The <i>lsof</i> distribution recommends that versions for these
    dialects run setgid and be allowed to surrender setgid permission.</p>

The <b>-D</b> option provides limited means for specifying the device cache file
  path. Its <b>?</b> function will report the read-only and write device cache
  file paths that <i>lsof</i> will use.
<p class="Pp">When the <b>-D</b> <b>b</b>, <b>r</b>, and <b>u</b> functions are
    available, you can use them to request that the cache file be built in a
    specific location (<b>b</b>[<i>path</i>]); read but not rebuilt
    (<b>r</b>[<i>path</i>]); or read and rebuilt (<b>u</b>[<i>path</i>]). The
    <b>b</b>, <b>r</b>, and <b>u</b> functions are restricted under some
    conditions. They are restricted when the <i>lsof</i> process is setuid-root.
    The path specified with the <b>r</b> function is always read-only, even when
    it is available.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>b</b>, <b>r</b>, and <b>u</b> functions are also restricted
    when the <i>lsof</i> process runs setgid and <i>lsof</i> doesn't surrender
    the setgid permission. (See the <b>LSOF PERMISSIONS THAT AFFECT DEVICE CACHE
    FILE ACCESS</b> section for a list of implementations that normally don't
    surrender their setgid permission.)</p>
<p class="Pp">A further <b>-D</b> function, <b>i</b> (for ignore), is always
    available.</p>
<p class="Pp">When available, the <b>b</b> function tells <i>lsof</i> to read
    device information from the kernel with the <i>stat</i>(2) function and
    build a device cache file at the indicated path.</p>
<p class="Pp">When available, the <b>r</b> function tells <i>lsof</i> to read
    the device cache file, but not update it. When a path argument accompanies
    <b>-Dr</b>, it names the device cache file path. The <b>r</b> function is
    always available when it is specified without a path name argument. If
    <i>lsof</i> is not running setuid-root and surrenders its setgid permission,
    a path name argument may accompany the <b>r</b> function.</p>
<p class="Pp">When available, the <b>u</b> function tells <i>lsof</i> to attempt
    to read and use the device cache file. If it can't read the file, or if it
    finds the contents of the file incorrect or outdated, it will read
    information from the kernel, and attempt to write an updated version of the

<i>Lsof's</i> second choice for the device cache file is the contents of the
  LSOFDEVCACHE environment variable. It avoids this choice if the <i>lsof</i>
  process is setuid-root, or the real UID of the process is root.
<p class="Pp">A further restriction applies to a device cache file path taken

<h1 class="Sh" id="SYSTEM-WIDE_DEVICE_CACHE_PATH"><a class="permalink" href="#SYSTEM-WIDE_DEVICE_CACHE_PATH">SYSTEM-WIDE
  DEVICE CACHE PATH</a></h1>
The local system administrator may choose to have a system-wide device cache
  file when building <i>lsof</i>. That file will generally be constructed by a
  special system administration procedure when the system is booted or when the
  contents of <i>/dev</i> or <i>/devices</i>) changes. If defined, it is
  <i>lsof's</i> third device cache file path choice.
<p class="Pp">You can tell that a system-wide device cache file is in effect for
    your local installation by examining the <i>lsof</i> help option output -
    i.e., the output from the <b>-h</b> or <b>-?</b> option.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Lsof</i> will never write to the system-wide device cache file
    path by default. It must be explicitly named with a <b>-D</b> function in a
    root-owned procedure. Once the file has been written, the procedure must
    change its permission modes to 0644 (owner-read and owner-write, group-read,

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="PERSONAL_DEVICE_CACHE_PATH_(DEFAULT)"><a class="permalink" href="#PERSONAL_DEVICE_CACHE_PATH_(DEFAULT)">PERSONAL
  DEVICE CACHE PATH (DEFAULT)</a></h1>
The default device cache file path of the <i>lsof</i> distribution is one
  recorded in the home directory of the real UID that executes <i>lsof</i>.
  Added to the home directory is a second path component of the form
  <i>.lsof_hostname</i>.
<p class="Pp">This is <i>lsof's</i> fourth device cache file path choice, and is
    usually the default. If a system-wide device cache file path was defined
    when <i>lsof</i> was built, this fourth choice will be applied when
    <i>lsof</i> can't find the system-wide device cache file. This is the
    <b>only</b> time <i>lsof</i> uses two paths when reading the device cache
    file.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>hostname</i> part of the second component is the base name
    of the executing host, as returned by <i>gethostname</i>(2). The base name
    is defined to be the characters preceding the first `.' in the
    <i>gethostname</i>(2) output, or all the <i>gethostname</i>(2) output if it
    contains no `.'.</p>
<p class="Pp">The device cache file belongs to the user ID and is readable and
    writable by the user ID alone - i.e., its modes are 0600. Each distinct real
    user ID on a given host that executes <i>lsof</i> has a distinct device
    cache file. The <i>hostname</i> part of the path distinguishes device cache
    files in an NFS-mounted home directory into which device cache files are
    written from several different hosts.</p>
<p class="Pp">The personal device cache file path formed by this method
    represents a device cache file that <i>lsof</i> will attempt to read, and
    will attempt to write should it not exist or should its contents be
    incorrect or outdated.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>-Dr</b> option without a path name argument will inhibit
    the writing of a new device cache file.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>-D?</b> option will list the format specification for
    constructing the personal device cache file. The conversions used in the
    format specification are described in the <i>00DCACHE</i> file of the
    <i>lsof</i> distribution.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="MODIFIED_PERSONAL_DEVICE_CACHE_PATH"><a class="permalink" href="#MODIFIED_PERSONAL_DEVICE_CACHE_PATH">MODIFIED
  PERSONAL DEVICE CACHE PATH</a></h1>
If this option is defined by the local system administrator when <i>lsof</i> is
  built, the LSOFPERSDCPATH environment variable contents may be used to add a
  component of the personal device cache file path.
<p class="Pp">The LSOFPERSDCPATH variable contents are inserted in the path at
    the place marked by the local system administrator with the ``%p''
    conversion in the HASPERSDC format specification of the dialect's
    <i>machine.h</i> header file. (It's placed right after the home directory in
    the default <i>lsof</i> distribution.)</p>
<p class="Pp">Thus, for example, if LSOFPERSDCPATH contains ``LSOF'', the home
    directory is ``/Homes/abe'', the host name is ``lsof.itap.purdue.edu'', and
    the HASPERSDC format is the default (``%h/%p.lsof_%L''), the modified
    personal device cache file path is:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
	/Homes/abe/LSOF/.lsof_vic
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The LSOFPERSDCPATH environment variable is ignored when the
    <i>lsof</i> process is setuid-root or when the real UID of the process is
    root.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Lsof</i> will not write to a modified personal device cache
    file path if the <i>lsof</i> process doesn't surrender setgid permission.
    (See the <b>LSOF PERMISSIONS THAT AFFECT DEVICE CACHE FILE ACCESS</b>
    section for a list of implementations that normally don't surrender their
    setgid permission.)</p>
<p class="Pp">If, for example, you want to create a sub-directory of personal
    device cache file paths by using the LSOFPERSDCPATH environment variable to
    name it, and <i>lsof</i> doesn't surrender its setgid permission, you will
    have to allow <i>lsof</i> to create device cache files at the standard
    personal path and move them to your subdirectory with shell commands.</p>
<p class="Pp">The local system administrator may: disable this option when
    <i>lsof</i> is built; change the name of the environment variable from
    LSOFPERSDCPATH to something else; change the HASPERSDC format to include the
    personal path component in another place; or exclude the personal path
    component entirely. Consult the output of the <b>-D?</b> option for the

<p class="Pp">It returns a zero (0) if no errors were detected and if it was

<p class="Pp">When <i>lsof</i> cannot open access to <i>/dev</i> (or
    <i>/devices</i>) or one of its subdirectories, or get information on a file
    in them with <i>stat</i>(2), it issues a warning message and continues. That
    <i>lsof</i> will issue warning messages about inaccessible files in
    <i>/dev</i> (or <i>/devices</i>) is indicated in its help output - requested

<h1 class="Sh" id="BUGS"><a class="permalink" href="#BUGS">BUGS</a></h1>
Since <i>lsof</i> reads kernel memory in its search for open files, rapid
  changes in kernel memory may produce unpredictable results.
<p class="Pp">When a file has multiple record locks, the lock status character
    (following the file descriptor) is derived from a test of the first lock
    structure, not from any combination of the individual record locks that
    might be described by multiple lock structures.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Lsof</i> can't search for files with restrictive access
    permissions by <i>name</i> unless it is installed with root set-UID
    permission. Otherwise it is limited to searching for files to which its user
    or its set-GID group (if any) has access permission.</p>
<p class="Pp">The display of the destination address of a raw socket (e.g., for
    <i>ping</i>) depends on the UNIX operating system. Some dialects store the
    destination address in the raw socket's protocol control block, some do
  not.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Lsof</i> can't always represent Solaris device numbers in the
    same way that <i>ls</i>(1) does. For example, the major and minor device
    numbers that the <i>lstat</i>(2) and <i>stat</i>(2) functions report for the
    directory on which CD-ROM files are mounted (typically <i>/cdrom</i>) are
    not the same as the ones that it reports for the device on which CD-ROM
    files are mounted (typically <i>/dev/sr0</i>). (<i>Lsof</i> reports the
    directory numbers.)</p>
<p class="Pp">The support for <i>/proc</i> file systems is available only for
    BSD and Tru64 UNIX dialects, Linux, and dialects derived from SYSV R4 -
    e.g., FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris, UnixWare.</p>
<p class="Pp">Some <i>/proc</i> file items - device number, inode number, and
    file size - are unavailable in some dialects. Searching for files in a
    <i>/proc</i> file system may require that the full path name be
  specified.</p>
<p class="Pp">No text (<b>txt</b>) file descriptors are displayed for Linux
    processes. All entries for files other than the current working directory,
    the root directory, and numerical file descriptors are labeled <b>mem</b>
    descriptors.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Lsof</i> can't search for Tru64 UNIX named pipes by name,
    because their kernel implementation of lstat(2) returns an improper device
    number for a named pipe.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Lsof</i> can't report fully or correctly on HP-UX 9.01, 10.20,
    and 11.00 locks because of insufficient access to kernel data or errors in
    the kernel data. See the <i>lsof</i> FAQ (The <b>FAQ</b> section gives its
    location.) for details.</p>
<p class="Pp">The AIX SMT file type is a fabrication. It's made up for file
    structures whose type (15) isn't defined in the AIX
    <i>/usr/include/sys/file.h</i> header file. One way to create such file
    structures is to run X clients with the DISPLAY variable set to
  ``:0.0''.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>+|-f</b><i>[cfgGn]</i> option is not supported under
    /proc-based Linux <i>lsof</i>, because it doesn't read kernel structures
    from kernel memory.</p>

The latest distribution of <i>lsof</i> is available via anonymous ftp from the
  host <i>lsof.itap.purdue.edu</i>. You'll find the <i>lsof</i> distribution in
  the <i>pub/tools/unix/lsof</i> directory.
<p class="Pp">You can also use this URL:</p>

<p class="Pp"><i>Lsof</i> is also mirrored elsewhere. When you access
    <i>lsof.itap.purdue.edu</i> and change to its <i>pub/tools/unix/lsof</i>
    directory, you'll be given a list of some mirror sites. The
    <i>pub/tools/unix/lsof</i> directory also contains a more complete list in
    its <i>mirrors</i> file. Use mirrors with caution - not all mirrors always
    have the latest <i>lsof</i> revision.</p>
<p class="Pp">Some pre-compiled <i>Lsof</i> executables are available on
    <i>lsof.itap.purdue.edu</i>, but their use is discouraged - it's better that
    you build your own from the sources. If you feel you must use a pre-compiled
    executable, please read the cautions that appear in the README files of the
    <i>pub/tools/unix/lsof/binaries</i> subdirectories and in the 00* files of
    the distribution.</p>
<p class="Pp">More information on the <i>lsof</i> distribution can be found in
    its <i>README.lsof_&lt;version&gt;</i> file. If you intend to get the
    <i>lsof</i> distribution and build it, please read
    <i>README.lsof_&lt;version&gt;</i> and the other 00* files of the
