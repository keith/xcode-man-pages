    Perl DBD's</p>
<p class="Pp">Jens Rehsack - May 2010</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="permalink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">This document gives a high level overview of the future of the
    DBD::File DBI driver and groundwork for pure Perl DBI drivers.</p>
<p class="Pp">The planned enhancements cover features, testing, performance,
    reliability, extensibility and more.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="CHANGES_AND_ENHANCEMENTS"><a class="permalink" href="#CHANGES_AND_ENHANCEMENTS">CHANGES
  AND ENHANCEMENTS</a></h1>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Features"><a class="permalink" href="#Features">Features</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">There are some features missing we would like to add, but there is
    no time plan:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="LOCK"><a class="permalink" href="#LOCK">LOCK TABLE</a></dt>
  <dd>The newly implemented internal common table meta storage area would allow
      us to implement LOCK TABLE support based on file system
      <span class="Li">&quot;flock ()&quot;</span> support.</dd>
  <dt id="Transaction"><a class="permalink" href="#Transaction">Transaction
    support</a></dt>
  <dd>While DBD::AnyData recommends explicitly committing by importing and
      exporting tables, DBD::File might be enhanced in a future version to allow
      transparent transactions using the temporary tables of SQL::Statement as
      shadow (dirty) tables.
    <p class="Pp">Transaction support will heavily rely on lock table
      support.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="Data"><a class="permalink" href="#Data">Data Dictionary
    Persistence</a></dt>
  <dd>SQL::Statement provides dictionary information when a &quot;CREATE TABLE
      ...&quot; statement is executed. This dictionary is preserved for some
      statement handle attribute fetches (as
      <span class="Li">&quot;NULLABLE&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;PRECISION&quot;</span>).
    <p class="Pp">It is planned to extend DBD::File to support data dictionaries
        to work on the tables in it. It is not planned to support one table in
        different dictionaries, but you can have several dictionaries in one
        directory.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="SQL"><a class="permalink" href="#SQL">SQL Engine selecting on
    connect</a></dt>
  <dd>Currently the SQL engine selected is chosen during the loading of the
      module DBI::SQL::Nano. Ideally end users should be able to select the
      engine used in <span class="Li">&quot;DBI-&gt;connect ()&quot;</span> with
      a special DBD::File attribute.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Other points of view to the planned features (and more features
    for the SQL::Statement engine) are shown in SQL::Statement::Roadmap.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Testing"><a class="permalink" href="#Testing">Testing</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">DBD::File and the dependent DBD::DBM requires a lot more automated
    tests covering API stability and compatibility with optional modules like
    SQL::Statement.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Performance"><a class="permalink" href="#Performance">Performance</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Several arguments for support of features like indexes on columns
    and cursors are made for DBD::CSV (which is a DBD::File based driver, too).
    Similar arguments could be made for DBD::DBM, DBD::AnyData, DBD::RAM or
    DBD::PO etc.</p>
<p class="Pp">To improve the performance of the underlying SQL engines, a clean
    re-implementation seems to be required. Currently both engines are
    prematurely optimized and therefore it is not trivial to provide further
    optimization without the risk of breaking existing features.</p>
<p class="Pp">Join the DBI developers IRC channel at
    &lt;irc://irc.perl.org/dbi&gt; to participate or post to the DBI Developers
    Mailing List.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Reliability"><a class="permalink" href="#Reliability">Reliability</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">DBD::File currently lacks the following points:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="duplicate"><a class="permalink" href="#duplicate">duplicate table
    names</a></dt>
  <dd>It is currently possible to access a table quoted with a relative path (a)
      and additionally using an absolute path (b). If (a) and (b) are the same
      file that is not recognized (except for flock protection handled by the
      Operating System) and two independent tables are handled.</dd>
  <dt id="invalid"><a class="permalink" href="#invalid">invalid table
    names</a></dt>
  <dd>The current implementation does not prevent someone choosing a directory
      name as a physical file name for the table to open.</dd>
</dl>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Extensibility"><a class="permalink" href="#Extensibility">Extensibility</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">I (Jens Rehsack) have some (partially for example only) DBD's in
    mind:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="DBD::Sys"><a class="permalink" href="#DBD::Sys">DBD::Sys</a></dt>
  <dd>Derive DBD::Sys from a common code base shared with DBD::File which
      handles all the emulation DBI needs (as getinfo, SQL engine handling,
    ...)</dd>
  <dt id="DBD::Dir"><a class="permalink" href="#DBD::Dir">DBD::Dir</a></dt>
  <dd>Provide a DBD::File derived to work with fixed table definitions through
      the file system to demonstrate how DBI / Pure Perl DBDs could handle
      databases with hierarchical structures.</dd>
  <dt id="DBD::Join"><a class="permalink" href="#DBD::Join">DBD::Join</a></dt>
  <dd>Provide a DBI driver which is able to manage multiple connections to other
      Databases (as DBD::Multiplex), but allow them to point to different data
      sources and allow joins between the tables of them:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>  # Example
  # Let table 'lsof' being a table in DBD::Sys giving a list of open files using lsof utility
  # Let table 'dir' being a atable from DBD::Dir
  $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare( &quot;select * from dir,lsof where path='/documents' and dir.entry = lsof.filename&quot; )
  $sth-&gt;execute(); # gives all open files in '/documents'
  ...
  # Let table 'filesys' a DBD::Sys table of known file systems on current host
  # Let table 'applications' a table of your Configuration Management Database
  #  where current applications (relocatable, with mountpoints for filesystems)
  #  are stored
  $sth = dbh-&gt;prepare( &quot;select * from applications,filesys where &quot; .
                       &quot;application.mountpoint = filesys.mountpoint and &quot;.
                       &quot;filesys.mounted is true&quot; );
  $sth-&gt;execute(); # gives all currently mounted applications on this host
    </pre>
  </dd>
</dl>
</section>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="PRIORITIES"><a class="permalink" href="#PRIORITIES">PRIORITIES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Our priorities are focused on current issues. Initially many new
    test cases for DBD::File and DBD::DBM should be added to the DBI test suite.
    After that some additional documentation on how to use the DBD::File API
    will be provided.</p>
<p class="Pp">Any additional priorities will come later and can be modified by
    (paying) users.</p>
