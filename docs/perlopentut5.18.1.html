Perl has two simple, built-in ways to open files: the shell way for convenience,
  and the C way for precision. The shell way also has 2- and 3-argument forms,
  which have different semantics for handling the filename. The choice is yours.

<h1 class="Sh" id="Open_a_&amp;_la_shell"><a class="permalink" href="#Open_a_&amp;_la_shell">Open
  a la shell</a></h1>
Perl's <span class="Li">&quot;open&quot;</span> function was designed to mimic
  the way command-line redirection in the shell works. Here are some basic
  examples from the shell:
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    $ myprogram file1 file2 file3
    $ myprogram    &lt;  inputfile
    $ myprogram    &gt;  outputfile
    $ myprogram    &gt;&gt; outputfile
    $ myprogram    |  otherprogram 
    $ otherprogram |  myprogram
</pre>
<p class="Pp">And here are some more advanced examples:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    $ otherprogram      | myprogram f1 - f2
    $ otherprogram 2&gt;&amp;1 | myprogram -
    $ myprogram     &lt;&amp;3
    $ myprogram     &gt;&amp;4
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Programmers accustomed to constructs like those above can take
    comfort in learning that Perl directly supports these familiar constructs
    using virtually the same syntax as the shell.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Simple_Opens"><a class="permalink" href="#Simple_Opens">Simple
  Opens</a></h2>
The <span class="Li">&quot;open&quot;</span> function takes two arguments: the
  first is a filehandle, and the second is a single string comprising both what
  to open and how to open it. <span class="Li">&quot;open&quot;</span> returns
  true when it works, and when it fails, returns a false value and sets the
  special variable <span class="Li">$!</span> to reflect the system error. If
  the filehandle was previously opened, it will be implicitly closed first.
<p class="Pp">For example:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    open(INFO,      &quot;datafile&quot;) || die(&quot;can't open datafile: $!&quot;);
    open(INFO,   &quot;&lt;  datafile&quot;) || die(&quot;can't open datafile: $!&quot;);
    open(RESULTS,&quot;&gt;  runstats&quot;) || die(&quot;can't open runstats: $!&quot;);
    open(LOG,    &quot;&gt;&gt; logfile &quot;) || die(&quot;can't open logfile:  $!&quot;);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If you prefer the low-punctuation version, you could write that
    this way:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    open INFO,   &quot;&lt;  datafile&quot;  or die &quot;can't open datafile: $!&quot;;
    open RESULTS,&quot;&gt;  runstats&quot;  or die &quot;can't open runstats: $!&quot;;
    open LOG,    &quot;&gt;&gt; logfile &quot;  or die &quot;can't open logfile:  $!&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">A few things to notice. First, the leading
    <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;&quot;</span> is optional. If omitted, Perl
    assumes that you want to open the file for reading.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note also that the first example uses the
    <span class="Li">&quot;||&quot;</span> logical operator, and the second uses
    <span class="Li">&quot;or&quot;</span>, which has lower precedence. Using
    <span class="Li">&quot;||&quot;</span> in the latter examples would
    effectively mean</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    open INFO, ( &quot;&lt;  datafile&quot;  || die &quot;can't open datafile: $!&quot; );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">which is definitely not what you want.</p>
<p class="Pp">The other important thing to notice is that, just as in the shell,
    any whitespace before or after the filename is ignored. This is good,
    because you wouldn't want these to do different things:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    open INFO,   &quot;&lt;datafile&quot;   
    open INFO,   &quot;&lt; datafile&quot; 
    open INFO,   &quot;&lt;  datafile&quot;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Ignoring surrounding whitespace also helps for when you read a
    filename in from a different file, and forget to trim it before opening:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    $filename = &lt;INFO&gt;;         # oops, \n still there
    open(EXTRA, &quot;&lt; $filename&quot;) || die &quot;can't open $filename: $!&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This is not a bug, but a feature. Because
    <span class="Li">&quot;open&quot;</span> mimics the shell in its style of
    using redirection arrows to specify how to open the file, it also does so
    with respect to extra whitespace around the filename itself as well. For
    accessing files with naughty names, see &quot;Dispelling the
  Dweomer&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">There is also a 3-argument version of
    <span class="Li">&quot;open&quot;</span>, which lets you put the special
    redirection characters into their own argument:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    open( INFO, &quot;&gt;&quot;, $datafile ) || die &quot;Can't create $datafile: $!&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">In this case, the filename to open is the actual string in
    <span class="Li">$datafile</span>, so you don't have to worry about
    <span class="Li">$datafile</span> containing characters that might influence
    the open mode, or whitespace at the beginning of the filename that would be
    absorbed in the 2-argument version. Also, any reduction of unnecessary
    string interpolation is a good thing.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Indirect_Filehandles"><a class="permalink" href="#Indirect_Filehandles">Indirect
  Filehandles</a></h2>
<span class="Li">&quot;open&quot;</span>'s first argument can be a reference to
  a filehandle. As of perl 5.6.0, if the argument is uninitialized, Perl will
  automatically create a filehandle and put a reference to it in the first
  argument, like so:
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    open( my $in, $infile )   or die &quot;Couldn't read $infile: $!&quot;;
    while ( &lt;$in&gt; ) {
        # do something with $_
    }
    close $in;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Indirect filehandles make namespace management easier. Since
    filehandles are global to the current package, two subroutines trying to
    open <span class="Li">&quot;INFILE&quot;</span> will clash. With two
    functions opening indirect filehandles like <span class="Li">&quot;my
    $infile&quot;</span>, there's no clash and no need to worry about future
    conflicts.</p>
<p class="Pp">Another convenient behavior is that an indirect filehandle
    automatically closes when there are no more references to it:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    sub firstline {
        open( my $in, shift ) &amp;&amp; return scalar &lt;$in&gt;;
        # no close() required
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Indirect filehandles also make it easy to pass filehandles to and
    return filehandles from subroutines:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    for my $file ( qw(this.conf that.conf) ) {
        my $fin = open_or_throw('&lt;', $file);
        process_conf( $fin );
        # no close() needed
    }

    use Carp;
    sub open_or_throw {
        my ($mode, $filename) = @_;
        open my $h, $mode, $filename
            or croak &quot;Could not open '$filename': $!&quot;;
        return $h;
    }
</pre>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Pipe_Opens"><a class="permalink" href="#Pipe_Opens">Pipe
  Opens</a></h2>
In C, when you want to open a file using the standard I/O library, you use the
  <span class="Li">&quot;fopen&quot;</span> function, but when opening a pipe,
  you use the <span class="Li">&quot;popen&quot;</span> function. But in the
  shell, you just use a different redirection character. That's also the case
  for Perl. The <span class="Li">&quot;open&quot;</span> call remains the
  same--just its argument differs.
<p class="Pp">If the leading character is a pipe symbol,
    <span class="Li">&quot;open&quot;</span> starts up a new command and opens a
    write-only filehandle leading into that command. This lets you write into
    that handle and have what you write show up on that command's standard
    input. For example:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    open(PRINTER, &quot;| lpr -Plp1&quot;)    || die &quot;can't run lpr: $!&quot;;
    print PRINTER &quot;stuff\n&quot;;
    close(PRINTER)                  || die &quot;can't close lpr: $!&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If the trailing character is a pipe, you start up a new command
    and open a read-only filehandle leading out of that command. This lets
    whatever that command writes to its standard output show up on your handle
    for reading. For example:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    open(NET, &quot;netstat -i -n |&quot;)    || die &quot;can't fork netstat: $!&quot;;
    while (&lt;NET&gt;) { }               # do something with input
    close(NET)                      || die &quot;can't close netstat: $!&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">What happens if you try to open a pipe to or from a non-existent
    command? If possible, Perl will detect the failure and set
    <span class="Li">$!</span> as usual. But if the command contains special
    shell characters, such as <span class="Li">&quot;&gt;&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;*&quot;</span>, called 'metacharacters', Perl does
    not execute the command directly. Instead, Perl runs the shell, which then
    tries to run the command. This means that it's the shell that gets the error
    indication. In such a case, the <span class="Li">&quot;open&quot;</span>
    call will only indicate failure if Perl can't even run the shell. See
    &quot;How can I capture STDERR from an external command?&quot; in perlfaq8
    to see how to cope with this. There's also an explanation in perlipc.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you would like to open a bidirectional pipe, the IPC::Open2
    library will handle this for you. Check out &quot;Bidirectional
    Communication with Another Process&quot; in perlipc</p>
<p class="Pp">perl-5.6.x introduced a version of piped open that executes a
    process based on its command line arguments without relying on the shell.
    (Similar to the <span class="Li">&quot;system(@LIST)&quot;</span> notation.)
    This is safer and faster than executing a single argument pipe-command, but
    does not allow special shell constructs. (It is also not supported on
    Microsoft Windows, Mac OS Classic or RISC OS.)</p>
<p class="Pp">Here's an example of <span class="Li">&quot;open
    '-|'&quot;</span>, which prints a random Unix fortune cookie as
  uppercase:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    my $collection = shift(@ARGV);
    open my $fortune, '-|', 'fortune', $collection
        or die &quot;Could not find fortune - $!&quot;;
    while (&lt;$fortune&gt;)
    {
        print uc($_);
    }
    close($fortune);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">And this <span class="Li">&quot;open '|-'&quot;</span> pipes into
    lpr:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    open my $printer, '|-', 'lpr', '-Plp1'
        or die &quot;can't run lpr: $!&quot;;
    print {$printer} &quot;stuff\n&quot;;
    close($printer)
        or die &quot;can't close lpr: $!&quot;;
</pre>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="The_Minus_File"><a class="permalink" href="#The_Minus_File">The
  Minus File</a></h2>
Again following the lead of the standard shell utilities, Perl's
  <span class="Li">&quot;open&quot;</span> function treats a file whose name is
  a single minus, &quot;-&quot;, in a special way. If you open minus for
  reading, it really means to access the standard input. If you open minus for
  writing, it really means to access the standard output.
<p class="Pp">If minus can be used as the default input or default output, what
    happens if you open a pipe into or out of minus? What's the default command
    it would run? The same script as you're currently running! This is actually
    a stealth <span class="Li">&quot;fork&quot;</span> hidden inside an
    <span class="Li">&quot;open&quot;</span> call. See &quot;Safe Pipe
    Opens&quot; in perlipc for details.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Mixing_Reads_and_Writes"><a class="permalink" href="#Mixing_Reads_and_Writes">Mixing
  Reads and Writes</a></h2>
It is possible to specify both read and write access. All you do is add a
  &quot;+&quot; symbol in front of the redirection. But as in the shell, using a
  less-than on a file never creates a new file; it only opens an existing one.
  On the other hand, using a greater-than always clobbers (truncates to zero
  length) an existing file, or creates a brand-new one if there isn't an old
  one. Adding a &quot;+&quot; for read-write doesn't affect whether it only
  works on existing files or always clobbers existing ones.
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    open(WTMP, &quot;+&lt; /usr/adm/wtmp&quot;) 
        || die &quot;can't open /usr/adm/wtmp: $!&quot;;

    open(SCREEN, &quot;+&gt; lkscreen&quot;)
        || die &quot;can't open lkscreen: $!&quot;;

    open(LOGFILE, &quot;+&gt;&gt; /var/log/applog&quot;)
        || die &quot;can't open /var/log/applog: $!&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The first one won't create a new file, and the second one will
    always clobber an old one. The third one will create a new file if necessary
    and not clobber an old one, and it will allow you to read at any point in
    the file, but all writes will always go to the end. In short, the first case
    is substantially more common than the second and third cases, which are
    almost always wrong. (If you know C, the plus in Perl's
    <span class="Li">&quot;open&quot;</span> is historically derived from the
    one in C's fopen(3S), which it ultimately calls.)</p>
<p class="Pp">In fact, when it comes to updating a file, unless you're working
    on a binary file as in the WTMP case above, you probably don't want to use
    this approach for updating. Instead, Perl's <b>-i</b> flag comes to the
    rescue. The following command takes all the C, C++, or yacc source or header
    files and changes all their foo's to bar's, leaving the old version in the
    original filename with a &quot;.orig&quot; tacked on the end:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    $ perl -i.orig -pe 's/\bfoo\b/bar/g' *.[Cchy]
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This is a short cut for some renaming games that are really the
    best way to update textfiles. See the second question in perlfaq5 for more
    details.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Filters"><a class="permalink" href="#Filters">Filters</a></h2>
One of the most common uses for <span class="Li">&quot;open&quot;</span> is one
  you never even notice. When you process the ARGV filehandle using
  <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;ARGV&gt;&quot;</span>, Perl actually does an
  implicit open on each file in <span class="Li">@ARGV</span>. Thus a program
  called like this:
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    $ myprogram file1 file2 file3
</pre>
<p class="Pp">can have all its files opened and processed one at a time using a
    construct no more complex than:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    while (&lt;&gt;) {
        # do something with $_
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If <span class="Li">@ARGV</span> is empty when the loop first
    begins, Perl pretends you've opened up minus, that is, the standard input.
    In fact, <span class="Li">$ARGV</span>, the currently open file during
    <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;ARGV&gt;&quot;</span> processing, is even set to
    &quot;-&quot; in these circumstances.</p>
<p class="Pp">You are welcome to pre-process your <span class="Li">@ARGV</span>
    before starting the loop to make sure it's to your liking. One reason to do
    this might be to remove command options beginning with a minus. While you
    can always roll the simple ones by hand, the Getopts modules are good for
    this:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    use Getopt::Std;

    # -v, -D, -o ARG, sets $opt_v, $opt_D, $opt_o
    getopts(&quot;vDo:&quot;);            

    # -v, -D, -o ARG, sets $args{v}, $args{D}, $args{o}
    getopts(&quot;vDo:&quot;, \%args);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Or the standard Getopt::Long module to permit named arguments:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    use Getopt::Long;
    GetOptions( &quot;verbose&quot;  =&gt; \$verbose,        # --verbose
                &quot;Debug&quot;    =&gt; \$debug,          # --Debug
                &quot;output=s&quot; =&gt; \$output );       
            # --output=somestring or --output somestring
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Another reason for preprocessing arguments is to make an empty
    argument list default to all files:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    @ARGV = glob(&quot;*&quot;) unless @ARGV;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">You could even filter out all but plain, text files. This is a bit
    silent, of course, and you might prefer to mention them on the way.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    @ARGV = grep { -f &amp;&amp; -T } @ARGV;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If you're using the <b>-n</b> or <b>-p</b> command-line options,
    you should put changes to <span class="Li">@ARGV</span> in a
    <span class="Li">&quot;BEGIN{}&quot;</span> block.</p>
<p class="Pp">Remember that a normal <span class="Li">&quot;open&quot;</span>
    has special properties, in that it might call fopen(3S) or it might called
    popen(3S), depending on what its argument looks like; that's why it's
    sometimes called &quot;magic open&quot;. Here's an example:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    $pwdinfo = `domainname` =~ /^(\(none\))?$/
                    ? '&lt; /etc/passwd'
                    : 'ypcat passwd |';

    open(PWD, $pwdinfo)                 
                or die &quot;can't open $pwdinfo: $!&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This sort of thing also comes into play in filter processing.
    Because <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;ARGV&gt;&quot;</span> processing employs
    the normal, shell-style Perl <span class="Li">&quot;open&quot;</span>, it
    respects all the special things we've already seen:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    $ myprogram f1 &quot;cmd1|&quot; - f2 &quot;cmd2|&quot; f3 &lt; tmpfile
</pre>
<p class="Pp">That program will read from the file <i>f1</i>, the process
    <i>cmd1</i>, standard input (<i>tmpfile</i> in this case), the <i>f2</i>
    file, the <i>cmd2</i> command, and finally the <i>f3</i> file.</p>
<p class="Pp">Yes, this also means that if you have files named &quot;-&quot;
    (and so on) in your directory, they won't be processed as literal files by
    <span class="Li">&quot;open&quot;</span>. You'll need to pass them as
    &quot;./-&quot;, much as you would for the <i>rm</i> program, or you could
    use <span class="Li">&quot;sysopen&quot;</span> as described below.</p>
<p class="Pp">One of the more interesting applications is to change files of a
    certain name into pipes. For example, to autoprocess gzipped or compressed
    files by decompressing them with <i>gzip</i>:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    @ARGV = map { /\.(gz|Z)$/ ? &quot;gzip -dc $_ |&quot; : $_  } @ARGV;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Or, if you have the <i>GET</i> program installed from LWP, you can
    fetch URLs before processing them:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    @ARGV = map { m#^\w+://# ? &quot;GET $_ |&quot; : $_ } @ARGV;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">It's not for nothing that this is called magic
    <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;ARGV&gt;&quot;</span>. Pretty nifty, eh?</p>

If you want the convenience of the shell, then Perl's
  <span class="Li">&quot;open&quot;</span> is definitely the way to go. On the
  other hand, if you want finer precision than C's simplistic fopen(3S) provides
  you should look to Perl's <span class="Li">&quot;sysopen&quot;</span>, which
  is a direct hook into the <i>open</i>(2) system call. That does mean it's a
  bit more involved, but that's the price of precision.
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;sysopen&quot;</span> takes 3 (or 4)
    arguments.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    sysopen HANDLE, PATH, FLAGS, [MASK]
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The HANDLE argument is a filehandle just as with
    <span class="Li">&quot;open&quot;</span>. The PATH is a literal path, one
    that doesn't pay attention to any greater-thans or less-thans or pipes or
    minuses, nor ignore whitespace. If it's there, it's part of the path. The
    FLAGS argument contains one or more values derived from the Fcntl module
    that have been or'd together using the bitwise &quot;|&quot; operator. The
    final argument, the MASK, is optional; if present, it is combined with the
    user's current umask for the creation mode of the file. You should usually
    omit this.</p>
<p class="Pp">Although the traditional values of read-only, write-only, and
    read-write are 0, 1, and 2 respectively, this is known not to hold true on
    some systems. Instead, it's best to load in the appropriate constants first
    from the Fcntl module, which supplies the following standard flags:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    O_RDONLY            Read only
    O_WRONLY            Write only
    O_RDWR              Read and write
    O_CREAT             Create the file if it doesn't exist
    O_EXCL              Fail if the file already exists
    O_APPEND            Append to the file
    O_TRUNC             Truncate the file
    O_NONBLOCK          Non-blocking access
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Less common flags that are sometimes available on some operating
    systems include <span class="Li">&quot;O_BINARY&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;O_TEXT&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;O_SHLOCK&quot;</span>,

    <span class="Li">&quot;O_LARGEFILE&quot;</span>. Consult your <i>open</i>(2)
    manpage or its local equivalent for details. (Note: starting from Perl
    release 5.6 the <span class="Li">&quot;O_LARGEFILE&quot;</span> flag, if
    available, is automatically added to the <i>sysopen()</i> flags because
    large files are the default.)</p>
<p class="Pp">Here's how to use <span class="Li">&quot;sysopen&quot;</span> to
    emulate the simple <span class="Li">&quot;open&quot;</span> calls we had
    before. We'll omit the <span class="Li">&quot;|| die $!&quot;</span> checks
    for clarity, but make sure you always check the return values in real code.
    These aren't quite the same, since <span class="Li">&quot;open&quot;</span>
    will trim leading and trailing whitespace, but you'll get the idea.</p>

If you omit the MASK argument to <span class="Li">&quot;sysopen&quot;</span>,
  Perl uses the octal value 0666. The normal MASK to use for executables and
  directories should be 0777, and for anything else, 0666.
<p class="Pp">Why so permissive? Well, it isn't really. The MASK will be
    modified by your process's current
    <span class="Li">&quot;umask&quot;</span>. A umask is a number representing
    <i>disabled</i> permissions bits; that is, bits that will not be turned on
    in the created file's permissions field.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, if your <span class="Li">&quot;umask&quot;</span>
    were 027, then the 020 part would disable the group from writing, and the
    007 part would disable others from reading, writing, or executing. Under
    these conditions, passing <span class="Li">&quot;sysopen&quot;</span> 0666
    would create a file with mode 0640, since <span class="Li">&quot;0666 &amp;
    ~027&quot;</span> is 0640.</p>
<p class="Pp">You should seldom use the MASK argument to
    <span class="Li">&quot;sysopen()&quot;</span>. That takes away the user's
    freedom to choose what permission new files will have. Denying choice is
    almost always a bad thing. One exception would be for cases where sensitive
    or private data is being stored, such as with mail folders, cookie files,
    and internal temporary files.</p>

  Files (dups)</a></h2>
Sometimes you already have a filehandle open, and want to make another handle
  that's a duplicate of the first one. In the shell, we place an ampersand in
  front of a file descriptor number when doing redirections. For example,
  <span class="Li">&quot;2&gt;&amp;1&quot;</span> makes descriptor 2 (that's
  STDERR in Perl) be redirected into descriptor 1 (which is usually Perl's
  STDOUT). The same is essentially true in Perl: a filename that begins with an
  ampersand is treated instead as a file descriptor if a number, or as a
  filehandle if a string.
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    open(SAVEOUT, &quot;&gt;&amp;SAVEERR&quot;) || die &quot;couldn't dup SAVEERR: $!&quot;;
    open(MHCONTEXT, &quot;&lt;&amp;4&quot;)     || die &quot;couldn't dup fd4: $!&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">That means that if a function is expecting a filename, but you
    don't want to give it a filename because you already have the file open, you
    can just pass the filehandle with a leading ampersand. It's best to use a
    fully qualified handle though, just in case the function happens to be in a
    different package:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    somefunction(&quot;&amp;main::LOGFILE&quot;);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This way if <i>somefunction()</i> is planning on opening its
    argument, it can just use the already opened handle. This differs from
    passing a handle, because with a handle, you don't open the file. Here you
    have something you can pass to open.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you have one of those tricky, newfangled I/O objects that the
    C++ folks are raving about, then this doesn't work because those aren't a
    proper filehandle in the native Perl sense. You'll have to use
    <i>fileno()</i> to pull out the proper descriptor number, assuming you
  can:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    use IO::Socket;
    $handle = IO::Socket::INET-&gt;new(&quot;www.perl.com:80&quot;);
    $fd = $handle-&gt;fileno;
    somefunction(&quot;&amp;$fd&quot;);  # not an indirect function call
</pre>
<p class="Pp">It can be easier (and certainly will be faster) just to use real
    filehandles though:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    use IO::Socket;
    local *REMOTE = IO::Socket::INET-&gt;new(&quot;www.perl.com:80&quot;);
    die &quot;can't connect&quot; unless defined(fileno(REMOTE));
    somefunction(&quot;&amp;main::REMOTE&quot;);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If the filehandle or descriptor number is preceded not just with a
    simple &quot;&amp;&quot; but rather with a &quot;&amp;=&quot; combination,
    then Perl will not create a completely new descriptor opened to the same
    place using the <i>dup</i>(2) system call. Instead, it will just make
    something of an alias to the existing one using the fdopen(3S) library call.
    This is slightly more parsimonious of systems resources, although this is
    less a concern these days. Here's an example of that:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    $fd = $ENV{&quot;MHCONTEXTFD&quot;};
    open(MHCONTEXT, &quot;&lt;&amp;=$fd&quot;)   or die &quot;couldn't fdopen $fd: $!&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If you're using magic
    <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;ARGV&gt;&quot;</span>, you could even pass in as
    a command line argument in <span class="Li">@ARGV</span> something like
    <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;&amp;=$MHCONTEXTFD&quot;</span>, but we've never

<h2 class="Ss" id="Dispelling_the_Dweomer"><a class="permalink" href="#Dispelling_the_Dweomer">Dispelling
  the Dweomer</a></h2>
Perl is more of a DWIMmer language than something like Java--where DWIM is an
  acronym for &quot;do what I mean&quot;. But this principle sometimes leads to
  more hidden magic than one knows what to do with. In this way, Perl is also
  filled with <i>dweomer</i>, an obscure word meaning an enchantment. Sometimes,
  Perl's DWIMmer is just too much like dweomer for comfort.
<p class="Pp">If magic <span class="Li">&quot;open&quot;</span> is a bit too
    magical for you, you don't have to turn to
    <span class="Li">&quot;sysopen&quot;</span>. To open a file with arbitrary
    weird characters in it, it's necessary to protect any leading and trailing
    whitespace. Leading whitespace is protected by inserting a
    <span class="Li">&quot;./&quot;</span> in front of a filename that starts
    with whitespace. Trailing whitespace is protected by appending an ASCII NUL
    byte (<span class="Li">&quot;\0&quot;</span>) at the end of the string.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    $file =~ s#^(\s)#./$1#;
    open(FH, &quot;&lt; $file\0&quot;)   || die &quot;can't open $file: $!&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This assumes, of course, that your system considers dot the
    current working directory, slash the directory separator, and disallows
    ASCII NULs within a valid filename. Most systems follow these conventions,
    including all POSIX systems as well as proprietary Microsoft systems. The
    only vaguely popular system that doesn't work this way is the
    &quot;Classic&quot; Macintosh system, which uses a colon where the rest of
    us use a slash. Maybe <span class="Li">&quot;sysopen&quot;</span> isn't such
    a bad idea after all.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you want to use
    <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;ARGV&gt;&quot;</span> processing in a totally
    boring and non-magical way, you could do this first:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    #   &quot;Sam sat on the ground and put his head in his hands.  
    #   'I wish I had never come here, and I don't want to see 
    #   no more magic,' he said, and fell silent.&quot;
    for (@ARGV) { 
        s#^([^./])#./$1#;
        $_ .= &quot;\0&quot;;
    } 
    while (&lt;&gt;) {  
        # now process $_

One clever move with STDOUT is to explicitly close it when you're done with the
  program.
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    END { close(STDOUT) || die &quot;can't close stdout: $!&quot; }

<p class="Pp">If you don't do this, and your program fills up the disk partition
    due to a command line redirection, it won't report the error exit with a
    failure status.</p>
<p class="Pp">You don't have to accept the STDIN and STDOUT you were given. You
    are welcome to reopen them if you'd like.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    open(STDIN, &quot;&lt; datafile&quot;)
        || die &quot;can't open datafile: $!&quot;;

    open(STDOUT, &quot;&gt; output&quot;)
        || die &quot;can't open output: $!&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">And then these can be accessed directly or passed on to
    subprocesses. This makes it look as though the program were initially
    invoked with those redirections from the command line.</p>
<p class="Pp">It's probably more interesting to connect these to pipes. For
    example:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    $pager = $ENV{PAGER} || &quot;(less || more)&quot;;
    open(STDOUT, &quot;| $pager&quot;)
        || die &quot;can't fork a pager: $!&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This makes it appear as though your program were called with its
    stdout already piped into your pager. You can also use this kind of thing in
    conjunction with an implicit fork to yourself. You might do this if you
    would rather handle the post processing in your own program, just in a
    different process:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    head(100);
    while (&lt;&gt;) {
        print;
    } 

    sub head {
        my $lines = shift || 20;
        return if $pid = open(STDOUT, &quot;|-&quot;);       # return if parent

    Directories, symbolic links, named pipes, Unix-domain sockets, and block and
    character devices. Those are all files, too--just not <i>plain</i> files.
    This isn't the same issue as being a text file. Not all text files are plain
    files. Not all plain files are text files. That's why there are separate
    <span class="Li">&quot;-f&quot;</span> and

    <span class="Li">&quot;ioctl&quot;</span>s, all dissimilar, if you're going
    to manipulate ttys, it's best to make calls out to the <i>stty</i>(1)
    program if you have it, or else use the portable POSIX interface. To figure
    this all out, you'll need to read the <i>termios</i>(3) manpage, which
    describes the POSIX interface to tty devices, and then POSIX, which
    describes Perl's interface to POSIX. There are also some high-level modules
    on CPAN that can help you with these games. Check out Term::ReadKey and
    Term::ReadLine.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Opening_Sockets"><a class="permalink" href="#Opening_Sockets">Opening
  Sockets</a></h2>
What else can you open? To open a connection using sockets, you won't use one of
  Perl's two open functions. See &quot;Sockets: Client/Server
  Communication&quot; in perlipc for that. Here's an example. Once you have it,
  you can use FH as a bidirectional filehandle.
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    use IO::Socket;
    local *FH = IO::Socket::INET-&gt;new(&quot;www.perl.com:80&quot;);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">For opening up a URL, the LWP modules from CPAN are just what the
    doctor ordered. There's no filehandle interface, but it's still easy to get
    the contents of a document:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    use LWP::Simple;
    $doc = get('http://www.cpan.org/');

<h2 class="Ss" id="Binary_Files"><a class="permalink" href="#Binary_Files">Binary
  Files</a></h2>
On certain legacy systems with what could charitably be called terminally
  convoluted (some would say broken) I/O models, a file isn't a file--at least,
  not with respect to the C standard I/O library. On these old systems whose
  libraries (but not kernels) distinguish between text and binary streams, to
  get files to behave properly you'll have to bend over backwards to avoid nasty
  problems. On such infelicitous systems, sockets and pipes are already opened
  in binary mode, and there is currently no way to turn that off. With files,
  you have more options.
<p class="Pp">Another option is to use the
    <span class="Li">&quot;binmode&quot;</span> function on the appropriate
    handles before doing regular I/O on them:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    binmode(STDIN);
    binmode(STDOUT);
    while (&lt;STDIN&gt;) { print }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Passing <span class="Li">&quot;sysopen&quot;</span> a non-standard
    flag option will also open the file in binary mode on those systems that
    support it. This is the equivalent of opening the file normally, then
    calling <span class="Li">&quot;binmode&quot;</span> on the handle.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    sysopen(BINDAT, &quot;records.data&quot;, O_RDWR | O_BINARY)
        || die &quot;can't open records.data: $!&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Now you can use <span class="Li">&quot;read&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;print&quot;</span> on that handle without worrying
    about the non-standard system I/O library breaking your data. It's not a
    pretty picture, but then, legacy systems seldom are. CP/M will be with us
    until the end of days, and after.</p>
<p class="Pp">On systems with exotic I/O systems, it turns out that,
    astonishingly enough, even unbuffered I/O using
    <span class="Li">&quot;sysread&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;syswrite&quot;</span> might do sneaky data mutilation
    behind your back.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    while (sysread(WHENCE, $buf, 1024)) {
        syswrite(WHITHER, $buf, length($buf));
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Depending on the vicissitudes of your runtime system, even these
    calls may need <span class="Li">&quot;binmode&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;O_BINARY&quot;</span> first. Systems known to be free
    of such difficulties include Unix, the Mac OS, Plan 9, and Inferno.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="File_Locking"><a class="permalink" href="#File_Locking">File
  Locking</a></h2>
In a multitasking environment, you may need to be careful not to collide with
  other processes who want to do I/O on the same files as you are working on.
  You'll often need shared or exclusive locks on files for reading and writing
  respectively. You might just pretend that only exclusive locks exist.
<p class="Pp">Never use the existence of a file <span class="Li">&quot;-e
    $file&quot;</span> as a locking indication, because there is a race
    condition between the test for the existence of the file and its creation.
    It's possible for another process to create a file in the slice of time
    between your existence check and your attempt to create the file. Atomicity
    is critical.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl's most portable locking interface is via the
    <span class="Li">&quot;flock&quot;</span> function, whose simplicity is
    emulated on systems that don't directly support it such as SysV or Windows.
    The underlying semantics may affect how it all works, so you should learn
    how <span class="Li">&quot;flock&quot;</span> is implemented on your
    system's port of Perl.</p>
<p class="Pp">File locking <i>does not</i> lock out another process that would
    like to do I/O. A file lock only locks out others trying to get a lock, not
    processes trying to do I/O. Because locks are advisory, if one process uses
    locking and another doesn't, all bets are off.</p>
<p class="Pp">By default, the <span class="Li">&quot;flock&quot;</span> call
    will block until a lock is granted. A request for a shared lock will be
    granted as soon as there is no exclusive locker. A request for an exclusive
    lock will be granted as soon as there is no locker of any kind. Locks are on
    file descriptors, not file names. You can't lock a file until you open it,
    and you can't hold on to a lock once the file has been closed.</p>
<p class="Pp">Here's how to get a blocking shared lock on a file, typically used
    for reading:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    use 5.004;
    use Fcntl qw(:DEFAULT :flock);
    open(FH, &quot;&lt; filename&quot;)  or die &quot;can't open filename: $!&quot;;
    flock(FH, LOCK_SH)      or die &quot;can't lock filename: $!&quot;;
    # now read from FH
</pre>
<p class="Pp">You can get a non-blocking lock by using
    <span class="Li">&quot;LOCK_NB&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    flock(FH, LOCK_SH | LOCK_NB)
        or die &quot;can't lock filename: $!&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This can be useful for producing more user-friendly behaviour by
    warning if you're going to be blocking:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    use 5.004;
    use Fcntl qw(:DEFAULT :flock);
    open(FH, &quot;&lt; filename&quot;)  or die &quot;can't open filename: $!&quot;;
    unless (flock(FH, LOCK_SH | LOCK_NB)) {
        $| = 1;
        print &quot;Waiting for lock...&quot;;
        flock(FH, LOCK_SH)  or die &quot;can't lock filename: $!&quot;;
        print &quot;got it.\n&quot;
    } 
    # now read from FH
</pre>
<p class="Pp">To get an exclusive lock, typically used for writing, you have to
    be careful. We <span class="Li">&quot;sysopen&quot;</span> the file so it
    can be locked before it gets emptied. You can get a nonblocking version
    using <span class="Li">&quot;LOCK_EX | LOCK_NB&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    use 5.004;
    use Fcntl qw(:DEFAULT :flock);
    sysopen(FH, &quot;filename&quot;, O_WRONLY | O_CREAT)
        or die &quot;can't open filename: $!&quot;;
    flock(FH, LOCK_EX)
        or die &quot;can't lock filename: $!&quot;;
    truncate(FH, 0)
        or die &quot;can't truncate filename: $!&quot;;
    # now write to FH
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Finally, due to the uncounted millions who cannot be dissuaded
    from wasting cycles on useless vanity devices called hit counters, here's
    how to increment a number in a file safely:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    use Fcntl qw(:DEFAULT :flock);

    sysopen(FH, &quot;numfile&quot;, O_RDWR | O_CREAT)
        or die &quot;can't open numfile: $!&quot;;
    # autoflush FH
    $ofh = select(FH); $| = 1; select ($ofh);
    flock(FH, LOCK_EX)
        or die &quot;can't write-lock numfile: $!&quot;;

    $num = &lt;FH&gt; || 0;
    seek(FH, 0, 0)
        or die &quot;can't rewind numfile : $!&quot;;
    print FH $num+1, &quot;\n&quot;
        or die &quot;can't write numfile: $!&quot;;

    truncate(FH, tell(FH))
        or die &quot;can't truncate numfile: $!&quot;;
    close(FH)
        or die &quot;can't close numfile: $!&quot;;

<h2 class="Ss" id="_s-1IO_s0_Layers"><a class="permalink" href="#_s-1IO_s0_Layers">IO
  Layers</a></h2>
In Perl 5.8.0 a new I/O framework called &quot;PerlIO&quot; was introduced. This
  is a new &quot;plumbing&quot; for all the I/O happening in Perl; for the most
  part everything will work just as it did, but PerlIO also brought in some new
  features such as the ability to think of I/O as &quot;layers&quot;. One I/O
  layer may in addition to just moving the data also do transformations on the
  data. Such transformations may include compression and decompression,
  encryption and decryption, and transforming between various character
  encodings.
<p class="Pp">Full discussion about the features of PerlIO is out of scope for
    this tutorial, but here is how to recognize the layers being used:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>The three-(or more)-argument form of
      <span class="Li">&quot;open&quot;</span> is being used and the second
      argument contains something else in addition to the usual
      <span class="Li">'&lt;'</span>, <span class="Li">'&gt;'</span>,
      <span class="Li">'&gt;&gt;'</span>, <span class="Li">'|'</span> and their
      variants, for example:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    open(my $fh, &quot;&lt;:crlf&quot;, $fn);
    </pre>
  </li>
  <li>The two-argument form of <span class="Li">&quot;binmode&quot;</span> is
      being used, for example
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    binmode($fh, &quot;:encoding(utf16)&quot;);
    </pre>
  </li>
</ul>
