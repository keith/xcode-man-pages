   The definitions below are for supplemental macros used in Tcl/Tk
   manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget.  The
  	options follow on successive lines, in four columns separated
  	by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.

<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
This package creates a framework for on-demand replication of the interpreter
  state accross threads in an multithreading application. It relies on the
  mechanics of Tcl command tracing and the Tcl <b>unknown</b> command and
  mechanism.
<p class="Pp">The package requires Tcl threading extension but can be
    alternatively used stand-alone within the AOLserver, a scalable webserver
    from America Online.</p>
<p class="Pp">In a nutshell, a short sample illustrating the usage of the ttrace
    with the Tcl threading extension:</p>
<pre>
    % package require Ttrace
    2.6.5
    % set t1 [thread::create {package require Ttrace; thread::wait}]
    tid0x1802800
    % ttrace::eval {proc test args {return test-[thread::id]}}
    % thread::send $t1 test
    test-tid0x1802800
    % set t2 [thread::create {package require Ttrace; thread::wait}]
    tid0x1804000
    % thread::send $t2 test
    test-tid0x1804000
</pre>
<p class="Pp">As seen from above, the <b>ttrace::eval</b> and
    <b>ttrace::update</b> commands are used to create a thread-wide definition
    of a simple Tcl procedure and replicate that definition to all, already
    existing or later created, threads.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="USER_COMMANDS"><a class="permalink" href="#USER_COMMANDS">USER
  COMMANDS</a></h1>
This section describes user-level commands. Those commands can be used by script
  writers to control the execution of the tracing framework.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>ttrace::eval</b> <i>arg</i> ?arg ...?</dt>
  <dd>This command concatenates given arguments and evaluates the resulting Tcl
      command with trace framework enabled. If the command execution was ok, it
      takes necessary steps to automatically propagate the trace epoch change to
      all threads in the application. For AOLserver, only newly created threads
      actually receive the epoch change. For the Tcl threading extension, all
      threads created by the extension are automatically updated. If the command
      execution resulted in Tcl error, no state propagation takes place.
    <p class="Pp">This is the most important user-level command of the package
        as it wraps most of the commands described below. This greatly
        simplifies things, because user need to learn just this (one) command in
        order to effectively use the package. Other commands, as desribed below,
        are included mostly for the sake of completeness.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>ttrace::enable</b></dt>
  <dd>Activates all registered callbacks in the framework and starts a new trace
      epoch. The trace epoch encapsulates all changes done to the interpreter
      during the time traces are activated.</dd>
  <dt><b>ttrace::disable</b></dt>
  <dd>Deactivates all registered callbacks in the framework and closes the
      current trace epoch.</dd>
  <dt><b>ttrace::cleanup</b></dt>
  <dd>Used to clean-up all on-demand loaded resources in the interpreter. It
      effectively brings Tcl interpreter to its pristine state.</dd>
  <dt><b>ttrace::update</b> ?epoch?</dt>
  <dd>Used to refresh the state of the interpreter to match the optional trace
      ?epoch?. If the optional ?epoch? is not given, it takes the most recent
      trace epoch.</dd>
  <dt><b>ttrace::getscript</b></dt>
  <dd>Returns a synthetized Tcl script which may be sourced in any interpreter.
      This script sets the stage for the Tcl <b>unknown</b> command so it can
      load traced resources from the in-memory database. Normally, this command
      is automatically invoked by other higher-level commands like
      <b>ttrace::eval</b> and <b>ttrace::update</b>.</dd>
</dl>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="CALLBACK_COMMANDS"><a class="permalink" href="#CALLBACK_COMMANDS">CALLBACK
  COMMANDS</a></h1>
A word upfront: the package already includes callbacks for tracing following Tcl
  commands: <b>proc</b>, <b>namespace</b>, <b>variable</b>, <b>load</b>, and
  <b>rename</b>. Additionaly, a set of callbacks for tracing resources (object,
  clasess) for the XOTcl v1.3.8+, an OO-extension to Tcl, is also provided. This
  gives a solid base for solving most of the real-life needs and serves as an
  example for people wanting to customize the package to cover their specific
  needs.
<p class="Pp">Below, you can find commands for registering callbacks in the
    framework and for writing callback scripts. These callbacks are invoked by
    the framework in order to gather interpreter state changes, build in-memory
    database, perform custom-cleanups and various other tasks.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>ttrace::atenable</b> <i>cmd</i> <i>arglist</i> <i>body</i></dt>
  <dd>Registers Tcl callback to be activated at <b>ttrace::enable</b>.
      Registered callbacks are activated on FIFO basis. The callback definition
      includes the name of the callback, <i>cmd</i>, a list of callback
      arguments, <i>arglist</i> and the <i>body</i> of the callback.
      Effectively, this actually resembles the call interface of the standard
      Tcl <b>proc</b> command.</dd>
  <dt><b>ttrace::atdisable</b> <i>cmd</i> <i>arglist</i> <i>body</i></dt>
  <dd>Registers Tcl callback to be activated at <b>ttrace::disable</b>.
      Registered callbacks are activated on FIFO basis. The callback definition
      includes the name of the callback, <i>cmd</i>, a list of callback
      arguments, <i>arglist</i> and the <i>body</i> of the callback.
      Effectively, this actually resembles the call interface of the standard
      Tcl <b>proc</b> command.</dd>
  <dt><b>ttrace::addtrace</b> <i>cmd</i> <i>arglist</i> <i>body</i></dt>
  <dd>Registers Tcl callback to be activated for tracing the Tcl <b>cmd</b>
      command. The callback definition includes the name of the Tcl command to
      trace, <i>cmd</i>, a list of callback arguments, <i>arglist</i> and the
      <i>body</i> of the callback. Effectively, this actually resembles the call
      interface of the standard Tcl <b>proc</b> command.</dd>
  <dt><b>ttrace::addscript</b> <i>name</i> <i>body</i></dt>
  <dd>Registers Tcl callback to be activated for building a Tcl script to be
      passed to other interpreters. This script is used to set the stage for the
      Tcl <b>unknown</b> command. Registered callbacks are activated on FIFO
      basis. The callback definition includes the name of the callback,
      <i>name</i> and the <i>body</i> of the callback.</dd>
  <dt><b>ttrace::addresolver</b> <i>cmd</i> <i>arglist</i> <i>body</i></dt>
  <dd>Registers Tcl callback to be activated by the overloaded Tcl
      <b>unknown</b> command. Registered callbacks are activated on FIFO basis.
      This callback is used to resolve the resource and load the resource in the
      current interpreter.</dd>
  <dt><b>ttrace::addcleanup</b> <i>body</i></dt>
  <dd>Registers Tcl callback to be activated by the <b>trace::cleanup</b>.
      Registered callbacks are activated on FIFO basis.</dd>
  <dt><b>ttrace::addentry</b> <i>cmd</i> <i>var</i> <i>val</i></dt>
  <dd>Adds one entry to the named in-memory database.</dd>
  <dt><b>ttrace::getentry</b> <i>cmd</i> <i>var</i></dt>
  <dd>Returns the value of the entry from the named in-memory database.</dd>
  <dt><b>ttrace::getentries</b> <i>cmd</i> ?pattern?</dt>
  <dd>Returns names of all entries from the named in-memory database.</dd>
  <dt><b>ttrace::delentry</b> <i>cmd</i></dt>
  <dd>Deletes an entry from the named in-memory database.</dd>
  <dt><b>ttrace::preload</b> <i>cmd</i></dt>
  <dd>Registers the Tcl command to be loaded in the interpreter. Commands
      registered this way will always be the part of the interpreter and not be
      on-demand loaded by the Tcl <b>unknown</b> command.</dd>

<h1 class="Sh" id="DISCUSSION"><a class="permalink" href="#DISCUSSION">DISCUSSION</a></h1>
Common introspective state-replication approaches use a custom Tcl script to
  introspect the running interpreter and synthesize another Tcl script to
  replicate this state in some other interpreter. This package, on the contrary,
  uses Tcl command traces. Command traces are registered on selected Tcl
  commands, like <b>proc</b>, <b>namespace</b>, <b>load</b> and other standard
  (and/or user-defined) Tcl commands. When activated, those traces build an
  in-memory database of created resources. This database is used as a resource
  repository for the (overloaded) Tcl <b>unknown</b> command which creates the
  requested resource in the interpreter on demand. This way, users can update
  just one interpreter (master) in one thread and replicate that interpreter
  state (or part of it) to other threads/interpreters in the process.
<p class="Pp">Immediate benefit of such approach is the much smaller memory
    footprint of the application and much faster thread creation. By not
    actually loading all necessary procedures (and other resources) in every
    thread at the thread initialization time, but by deffering this to the time
    the resource is actually referenced, significant improvements in both memory
    consumption and thread initialization time can be achieved. Some tests have
    shown that memory footprint of an multithreading Tcl application went down
    more than three times and thread startup time was reduced for about 50
    times. Note that your mileage may vary. Other benefits include much finer
    control about what (and when) gets replicated from the master to other Tcl
    thread/interpreters.</p>
