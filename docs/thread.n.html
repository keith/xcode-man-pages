   The definitions below are for supplemental macros used in Tcl/Tk
   manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget.  The
  	options follow on successive lines, in four columns separated
  	by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.

<p class="Pp">The <b>thread</b> extension creates threads that contain Tcl
    interpreters, and it lets you send scripts to those threads for evaluation.
    Additionaly, it provides script-level access to basic thread synchronization
    primitives, like mutexes and condition variables.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="COMMANDS"><a class="permalink" href="#COMMANDS">COMMANDS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">This section describes commands for creating and destroying
    threads and sending scripts to threads for evaluation.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="thread::create"><a class="permalink" href="#thread::create"><b>thread::create</b>
    ?-joinable? ?-preserved? ?script?</a></dt>
  <dd>This command creates a thread that contains a Tcl interpreter. The Tcl
      interpreter either evaluates the optional <b>script</b>, if specified, or
      it waits in the event loop for scripts that arrive via the
      <b>thread::send</b> command. The result, if any, of the optional
      <b>script</b> is never returned to the caller. The result of
      <b>thread::create</b> is the ID of the thread. This is the opaque handle
      which identifies the newly created thread for all other package commands.
      The handle of the thread goes out of scope automatically when thread is
      marked for exit (see the <b>thread::release</b> command below).
    <p class="Pp">If the optional <b>script</b> argument contains the
        <b>thread::wait</b> command the thread will enter into the event loop.
        If such command is not found in the <b>script</b> the thread will run
        the <b>script</b> to the end and exit. In that case, the handle may be
        safely ignored since it refers to a thread which does not exists any
        more at the time when the command returns.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Using flag <b>-joinable</b> it is possible to create a
        joinable thread, i.e. one upon whose exit can be waited upon by using
        <b>thread::join</b> command. Note that failure to join a thread created
        with <b>-joinable</b> flag results in resource and memory leaks.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Threads created by the <b>thread::create</b> cannot be
        destroyed forcefully. Consequently, there is no corresponding thread
        destroy command. A thread may only be released using the
        <b>thread::release</b> and if its internal reference count drops to
        zero, the thread is marked for exit. This kicks the thread out of the
        event loop servicing and the thread continues to execute commands passed
        in the <b>script</b> argument, following the <b>thread::wait</b>
        command. If this was the last command in the script, as usualy the case,
        the thread will exit.</p>
    <p class="Pp">It is possible to create a situation in which it may be
        impossible to terminate the thread, for example by putting some endless
        loop after the <b>thread::wait</b> or entering the event loop again by
        doing an vwait-type of command. In such cases, the thread may never
        exit. This is considered to be a bad practice and should be avoided if
        possible. This is best illustrated by the example below:</p>
    <pre>
<br/>
    # You should never do ...
<br/>
    set tid [thread::create {
<br/>
        package require Http
<br/>
        thread::wait
<br/>
        vwait forever ; # &lt;-- this!
<br/>
    }]</pre>
    The thread created in the above example will never be able to exit. After it
      has been released with the last matching <b>thread::release</b> call, the
      thread will jump out of the <b>thread::wait</b> and continue to execute
      commands following. It will enter <b>vwait</b> command and wait endlessly
      for events. There is no way one can terminate such thread, so you wouldn't
      want to do this!
    <p class="Pp">Each newly created has its internal reference counter set to 0
        (zero), i.e. it is unreserved. This counter gets incremented by a call
        to <b>thread::preserve</b> and decremented by a call to
        <b>thread::release</b> command. These two commands implement simple but
        effective thread reservation system and offer predictable and
        controllable thread termination capabilities. It is however possible to
        create initialy preserved threads by using flag <b>-preserved</b> of the
        <b>thread::create</b> command. Threads created with this flag have the
        initial value of the reference counter of 1 (one), and are thus
        initially marked reserved.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="thread::preserve"><a class="permalink" href="#thread::preserve"><b>thread::preserve</b>
    ?id?</a></dt>
  <dd>This command increments the thread reference counter. Each call to this
      command increments the reference counter by one (1). Command returns the
      value of the reference counter after the increment. If called with the
      optional thread <b>id</b>, the command preserves the given thread.
      Otherwise the current thread is preserved.
    <p class="Pp">With reference counting, one can implement controlled access
        to a shared Tcl thread. By incrementing the reference counter, the
        caller signalizes that he/she wishes to use the thread for a longer
        period of time. By decrementing the counter, caller signalizes that
        he/she has finished using the thread.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="thread::release"><a class="permalink" href="#thread::release"><b>thread::release</b>
    ?-wait? ?id?</a></dt>
  <dd>This command decrements the thread reference counter. Each call to this
      command decrements the reference counter by one (1). If called with the
      optional thread <b>id</b>, the command releases the given thread.
      Otherwise, the current thread is released. Command returns the value of
      the reference counter after the decrement. When the reference counter
      reaches zero (0), the target thread is marked for termination. You should
      not reference the thread after the <b>thread::release</b> command returns
      zero or negative integer. The handle of the thread goes out of scope and
      should not be used any more. Any following reference to the same thread
      handle will result in Tcl error.
    <p class="Pp">Optional flag <b>-wait</b> instructs the caller thread to wait
        for the target thread to exit, if the effect of the command would result
        in termination of the target thread, i.e. if the return result would be
        zero (0). Without the flag, the caller thread does not wait for the
        target thread to exit. Care must be taken when using the <b>-wait</b>,
        since this may block the caller thread indefinitely. This option has
        been implemented for some special uses of the extension and is
        deprecated for regular use. Regular users should create joinable threads
        by using the <b>-joinable</b> option of the <b>thread::create</b>
        command and the <b>thread::join</b> to wait for thread to exit.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="thread::id"><a class="permalink" href="#thread::id"><b>thread::id</b></a></dt>
  <dd>This command returns the ID of the current thread.</dd>
  <dt id="thread::errorproc"><a class="permalink" href="#thread::errorproc"><b>thread::errorproc</b>
    ?procname?</a></dt>
  <dd>This command sets a handler for errors that occur in scripts sent
      asynchronously, using the <b>-async</b> flag of the <b>thread::send</b>
      command, to other threads. If no handler is specified, the current handler
      is returned. The empty string resets the handler to default (unspecified)
      value. An uncaught error in a thread causes an error message to be sent to
      the standard error channel. This default reporting scheme can be changed
      by registering a procedure which is called to report the error. The
      <i>procname</i> is called in the interpreter that invoked the
      <b>thread::errorproc</b> command. The <i>procname</i> is called like this:
    <pre>
<br/>
    myerrorproc thread_id errorInfo</pre>
  </dd>
  <dt id="thread::unwind"><a class="permalink" href="#thread::unwind"><b>thread::unwind</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Use of this command is deprecated in favour of more advanced thread
      reservation system implemented with <b>thread::preserve</b> and
      <b>thread::release</b> commands. Support for <b>thread::unwind</b> command
      will dissapear in some future major release of the extension.
    <p class="Pp">This command stops a prior <b>thread::wait</b> command.
        Execution of the script passed to newly created thread will continue
        from the <b>thread::wait</b> command. If <b>thread::wait</b> was the
        last command in the script, the thread will exit. The command returns
        empty result but may trigger Tcl error with the message &quot;target
        thread died&quot; in some situations.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="thread::exit"><a class="permalink" href="#thread::exit"><b>thread::exit</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Use of this command is deprecated in favour of more advanced thread
      reservation system implemented with <b>thread::preserve</b> and
      <b>thread::release</b> commands. Support for <b>thread::exit</b> command
      will dissapear in some future major release of the extension.
    <p class="Pp">This command forces a thread stuck in the <b>thread::wait</b>
        command to unconditionaly exit. The execution of <b>thread::exit</b>
        command is guaranteed to leave the program memory in the unconsistent
        state, produce memory leaks and otherwise affect other subsytem(s) of
        the Tcl application in an unpredictable manner. The command returns
        empty result but may trigger Tcl error with the message &quot;target
        thread died&quot; in some situations.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="thread::names"><a class="permalink" href="#thread::names"><b>thread::names</b></a></dt>
  <dd>This command returns a list of thread IDs. These are only for threads that
      have been created via <b>thread::create</b> command. If your application
      creates other threads at the C level, they are not reported by this
      command.</dd>
  <dt id="thread::exists"><a class="permalink" href="#thread::exists"><b>thread::exists</b>
    <i>id</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Returns true (1) if thread given by the <i>id</i> parameter exists, false
      (0) otherwise. This applies only for threads that have been created via
      <b>thread::create</b> command.</dd>
  <dt id="thread::send"><a class="permalink" href="#thread::send"><b>thread::send</b>
    ?-async? ?-head? <i>id</i> <i>script</i> ?varname?</a></dt>
  <dd>This command passes a <i>script</i> to another thread and, optionally,
      waits for the result. If the <b>-async</b> flag is specified, the command
      does not wait for the result and it returns empty string. The target
      thread must enter it's event loop in order to receive scripts sent via
      this command. This is done by default for threads created without a
      startup script. Threads can enter the event loop explicitly by calling
      <b>thread::wait</b> or any other relevant Tcl/Tk command, like
      <b>update</b>, <b>vwait</b>, etc.
    <p class="Pp">Optional <b>varname</b> specifies name of the variable to
        store the result of the <i>script</i>. Without the <b>-async</b> flag,
        the command returns the evaluation code, similarily to the standard Tcl
        <b>catch</b> command. If, however, the <b>-async</b> flag is specified,
        the command returns immediately and caller can later <b>vwait</b> on
        ?varname? to get the result of the passed <i>script</i></p>
    <pre>
<br/>
    set t1 [thread::create]
<br/>
    set t2 [thread::create]
<br/>
    thread::send -async $t1 &quot;set a 1&quot; result
<br/>
    thread::send -async $t2 &quot;set b 2&quot; result
<br/>
    for {set i 0} {$i &lt; 2} {incr i} {
<br/>
        vwait result
<br/>
    }</pre>
    In the above example, two threads were fed work and both of them were
      instructed to signalize the same variable &quot;result&quot; in the
      calling thread. The caller entered the event loop twice to get both
      results. Note, however, that the order of the received results may vary,
      depending on the current system load, type of work done, etc, etc.
    <p class="Pp">Many threads can simultaneously send scripts to the target
        thread for execution. All of them are entered into the event queue of
        the target thread and executed on the FIFO basis, intermingled with
        optional other events pending in the event queue of the target thread.
        Using the optional ?-head? switch, scripts posted to the thread's event
        queue can be placed on the head, instead on the tail of the queue, thus
        being executed in the LIFO fashion.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="thread::broadcast"><a class="permalink" href="#thread::broadcast"><b>thread::broadcast</b>
    <i>id</i> <i>script</i></a></dt>
  <dd>This command passes a <i>script</i> to all threads created by the package
      for execution. It does not wait for response from any of the threads.</dd>
  <dt id="thread::wait"><a class="permalink" href="#thread::wait"><b>thread::wait</b></a></dt>
  <dd>This enters the event loop so a thread can receive messages from the
      <b>thread::send</b> command. This command should only be used within the
      script passed to the <b>thread::create</b>. It should be the very last
      command in the script. If this is not the case, the exiting thread will
      continue executing the script lines pass the <b>thread::wait</b> which is
      usually not what you want and/or expect.
    <pre>
<br/>
    set t1 [thread::create {
<br/>
        #
<br/>
        # Do some initialization work here
<br/>
        #
<br/>
        thread::wait ; # Enter the event loop
<br/>
    }]</pre>
  </dd>
  <dt id="thread::eval"><a class="permalink" href="#thread::eval"><b>thread::eval</b>
    ?-lock mutex? <i>arg</i> ?arg ...?</a></dt>
  <dd>This command concatenates passed arguments and evaluates the resulting
      script under the mutex protection. If no mutex is specified by using the
      ?-lock mutex? optional argument, the internal static mutex is used.</dd>
  <dt id="thread::join"><a class="permalink" href="#thread::join"><b>thread::join</b>
    <i>id</i></a></dt>
  <dd>This command waits for the thread with ID <i>id</i> to exit and then
      returns it's exit code. Errors will be returned for threads which are not
      joinable or already waited upon by another thread. Upon the join the
      handle of the thread has gone out of scope and should not be used any
      more.</dd>
  <dt id="thread::configure"><a class="permalink" href="#thread::configure"><b>thread::configure</b>
    <i>id</i> ?option? ?value? ?...?</a></dt>
  <dd>This command configures various low-level aspects of the thread with ID
      <i>id</i> in the similar way as the standard Tcl command <b>fconfigure</b>
      configures some Tcl channel options. Options currently supported are:
      <b>-eventmark</b> and <b>-unwindonerror</b>.
    <p class="Pp">The <b>-eventmark</b> option, when set, limits the number of
        asynchronously posted scripts to the thread event loop. The
        <b>thread::send -async</b> command will block until the number of
        pending scripts in the event loop does not drop below the value
        configured with <b>-eventmark</b>. Default value for the
        <b>-eventmark</b> is 0 (zero) which effectively disables the checking,
        i.e. allows for unlimited number of posted scripts.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The <b>-unwindonerror</b> option, when set, causes the target
        thread to unwind if the result of the script processing resulted in
        error. Default value for the <b>-unwindonerror</b> is 0 (false), i.e.
        thread continues to process scripts after one of the posted scripts
        fails.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="thread::transfer"><a class="permalink" href="#thread::transfer"><b>thread::transfer</b>
    <i>id</i> <i>channel</i></a></dt>
  <dd>This moves the specified <i>channel</i> from the current thread and
      interpreter to the main interpreter of the thread with the given
      <i>id</i>. After the move the current interpreter has no access to the
      channel any more, but the main interpreter of the target thread will be
      able to use it from now on. The command waits until the other thread has
      incorporated the channel. Because of this it is possible to deadlock the
      participating threads by commanding the other through a synchronous
      <b>thread::send</b> to transfer a channel to us. This easily extends into
      longer loops of threads waiting for each other. Other restrictions: the
      channel in question must not be shared among multiple interpreters running
      in the sending thread. This automatically excludes the special channels
      for standard input, output and error.
    <p class="Pp">Due to the internal Tcl core implementation and the
        restriction on transferring shared channels, one has to take extra
        measures when transferring socket channels created by accepting the
        connection out of the <b>socket</b> commands callback procedures:</p>
    <pre>
<br/>
    socket -server _Accept 2200
<br/>
    proc _Accept {s ipaddr port} {
<br/>
        after idle [list Accept $s $ipaddr $port]
<br/>
    }
<br/>
    proc Accept {s ipaddr port} {
<br/>
        set tid [thread::create]
<br/>
        thread::transfer $tid $s
<br/>
    }</pre>
  </dd>
  <dt id="thread::detach"><a class="permalink" href="#thread::detach"><b>thread::detach</b>
    <i>channel</i></a></dt>
  <dd>This detaches the specified <i>channel</i> from the current thread and
      interpreter. After that, the current interpreter has no access to the
      channel any more. The channel is in the parked state until some other (or
      the same) thread attaches the channel again with <b>thread::attach</b>.
      Restrictions: same as for transferring shared channels with the
      <b>thread::transfer</b> command.</dd>
  <dt id="thread::attach"><a class="permalink" href="#thread::attach"><b>thread::attach</b>
    <i>channel</i></a></dt>
  <dd>This attaches the previously detached <i>channel</i> in the current
      thread/interpreter. For already existing channels, the command does
      nothing, i.e. it is not an error to attach the same channel more than
      once. The first operation will actualy perform the operation, while all
      subsequent operation will just do nothing. Command throws error if the

  <dd>Mutexes are most common thread synchronization primitives. They are used
      to synchronize access from two or more threads to one or more shared
      resources. This command provides script-level access to exclusive and/or
      recursive mutexes. Exclusive mutexes can be locked only once by one
      thread, while recursive mutexes can be locked many times by the same
      thread. For recursive mutexes, number of lock and unlock operations must
      match, otherwise, the mutex will never be released, which would lead to
      various deadlock situations.
    <p class="Pp">Care has to be taken when using mutexes in an multithreading
        program. Improper use of mutexes may lead to various deadlock
        situations, especially when using exclusive mutexes.</p>

  <dd>This command creates many-readers/single-writer mutexes. Reader/writer
      mutexes allow you to serialize access to a shared resource more optimally.
      In situations where a shared resource gets mostly read and seldom
      modified, you might gain some performace by using reader/writer mutexes
      instead of exclusive or recursive mutexes.
    <p class="Pp">For reading the resource, thread should obtain a read lock on
        the resource. Read lock is non-exclusive, meaning that more than one
        thread can obtain a read lock to the same resource, without waiting on
        other readers. For changing the resource, however, a thread must obtain
        a exclusive write lock. This lock effectively blocks all threads from
        gaining the read-lock while the resource is been modified by the writer
        thread. Only after the write lock has been released, the resource may be
        read-locked again.</p>

  <dd>This command is used to suspend program execution until the condition
      variable <i>cond</i> has been signalled or the optional timer has expired.
      The exclusive <i>mutex</i> must be locked by the calling thread on
      entrance to this command. If the mutex is not locked, Tcl error is thrown.
      While waiting on the <i>cond</i>, the command releases <i>mutex</i>.
      Before returning to the calling thread, the command re-acquires the
      <i>mutex</i> again. Unlocking the <i>mutex</i> and waiting on the
      condition variable <i>cond</i> is done atomically.
    <p class="Pp">The <b>ms</b> command option, if given, must be an integer
        specifying time interval in milliseconds the command waits to be
        signalled. Otherwise the command waits on condition notify forever.</p>
    <p class="Pp">In multithreading programs, there are many situations where a
        thread has to wait for some event to happen until it is allowed to
        proceed. This is usually accomplished by repeatedly testing a condition
        under the mutex protection and waiting on the condition variable until
        the condition evaluates to true:</p>
    <pre>
<br/>
    set mutex [thread::mutex create]
<br/>
    set cond  [thread::cond  create]
<br/>
    thread::mutex lock $mutex
<br/>
    while {&lt;some_condition_is_true&gt;} {
<br/>
        thread::cond wait $cond $mutex
<br/>
    }
<br/>
    # Do some work under mutex protection
<br/>
    thread::mutex unlock $mutex</pre>
    Repeated testing of the condition is needed since the condition variable may
      get signalled without the condition being actually changed (spurious
      thread wake-ups, for example).</dd>

<p class="Pp">The fundamental threading model in Tcl is that there can be one or
    more Tcl interpreters per thread, but each Tcl interpreter should only be
    used by a single thread which created it. A &quot;shared memory&quot;
    abstraction is awkward to provide in Tcl because Tcl makes assumptions about
    variable and data ownership. Therefore this extension supports a simple form
    of threading where the main thread can manage several background, or
    &quot;worker&quot; threads. For example, an event-driven server can pass
    requests to worker threads, and then await responses from worker threads or
    new client requests. Everything goes through the common Tcl event loop, so
    message passing between threads works naturally with event-driven I/O,
    <b>vwait</b> on variables, and so forth. For the transfer of bulk
    information it is possible to move channels between the threads.</p>
<p class="Pp">For advanced multithreading scripts, script-level access to two
    basic synchronization primitives, mutex and condition variables, is also
    supported.</p>
