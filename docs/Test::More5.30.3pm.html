<b>STOP!</b> If you're just getting started writing tests, have a look at
  Test2::Suite first.
<p class="Pp">This is a drop in replacement for Test::Simple which you can
    switch to once you get the hang of basic testing.</p>
<p class="Pp">The purpose of this module is to provide a wide range of testing
    utilities. Various ways to say &quot;ok&quot; with better diagnostics,
    facilities to skip tests, test future features and compare complicated data
    structures. While you can do almost anything with a simple
    <span class="Li">&quot;ok()&quot;</span> function, it doesn't provide good
    diagnostic output.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="I_love_it_when_a_plan_comes_together"><a class="permalink" href="#I_love_it_when_a_plan_comes_together">I
  love it when a plan comes together</a></h2>
Before anything else, you need a testing plan. This basically declares how many
  tests your script is going to run to protect against premature failure.
<p class="Pp">The preferred way to do this is to declare a plan when you
    <span class="Li">&quot;use Test::More&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  use Test::More tests =&gt; 23;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">There are cases when you will not know beforehand how many tests
    your script is going to run. In this case, you can declare your tests at the
    end.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  use Test::More;

  ... run your tests ...

  done_testing( $number_of_tests_run );
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><b>NOTE</b> <span class="Li">&quot;done_testing()&quot;</span>
    should never be called in an <span class="Li">&quot;END { ... }&quot;</span>
    block.</p>
<p class="Pp">Sometimes you really don't know how many tests were run, or it's
    too difficult to calculate. In which case you can leave off
    <span class="Li">$number_of_tests_run</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">In some cases, you'll want to completely skip an entire testing
    script.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  use Test::More skip_all =&gt; $skip_reason;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Your script will declare a skip with the reason why you skipped
    and exit immediately with a zero (success). See Test::Harness for
  details.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you want to control what functions Test::More will export, you
    have to use the 'import' option. For example, to import everything but
    'fail', you'd do:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  use Test::More tests =&gt; 23, import =&gt; ['!fail'];
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Alternatively, you can use the
    <span class="Li">&quot;plan()&quot;</span> function. Useful for when you
    have to calculate the number of tests.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  use Test::More;
  plan tests =&gt; keys %Stuff * 3;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">or for deciding between running the tests at all:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  use Test::More;
  if( $^O eq 'MacOS' ) {
      plan skip_all =&gt; 'Test irrelevant on MacOS';
  }
  else {
      plan tests =&gt; 42;
  }
</pre>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>done_testing</b></dt>
  <dd><span class="Li"></span>
    <pre>
    done_testing();
    done_testing($number_of_tests);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If you don't know how many tests you're going to run, you can
        issue the plan when you're done running tests.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">$number_of_tests</span> is the same as
        <span class="Li">&quot;plan()&quot;</span>, it's the number of tests you
        expected to run. You can omit this, in which case the number of tests
        you ran doesn't matter, just the fact that your tests ran to
      conclusion.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This is safer than and replaces the &quot;no_plan&quot;
      plan.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><b>Note:</b> You must never put
        <span class="Li">&quot;done_testing()&quot;</span> inside an
        <span class="Li">&quot;END { ... }&quot;</span> block. The plan is there
        to ensure your test does not exit before testing has completed. If you
        use an END block you completely bypass this protection.</p>
  </dd>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Test_names"><a class="permalink" href="#Test_names">Test
  names</a></h2>
By convention, each test is assigned a number in order. This is largely done
  automatically for you. However, it's often very useful to assign a name to
  each test. Which would you rather see:
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  ok 4
  not ok 5
  ok 6
</pre>
<p class="Pp">or</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  ok 4 - basic multi-variable
  not ok 5 - simple exponential
  ok 6 - force == mass * acceleration
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The later gives you some idea of what failed. It also makes it
    easier to find the test in your script, simply search for &quot;simple
    exponential&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">All test functions take a name argument. It's optional, but highly
    suggested that you use it.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="I'm_ok,_you're_not_ok."><a class="permalink" href="#I'm_ok,_you're_not_ok.">I'm
  ok, you're not ok.</a></h2>
The basic purpose of this module is to print out either &quot;ok #&quot; or
  &quot;not ok #&quot; depending on if a given test succeeded or failed.
  Everything else is just gravy.
<p class="Pp">All of the following print &quot;ok&quot; or &quot;not ok&quot;
    depending on if the test succeeded or failed. They all also return true or
    false, respectively.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>ok</b></dt>
  <dd><span class="Li"></span>
    <pre>
  ok($got eq $expected, $test_name);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This simply evaluates any expression
        (<span class="Li">&quot;$got eq $expected&quot;</span> is just a simple
        example) and uses that to determine if the test succeeded or failed. A
        true expression passes, a false one fails. Very simple.</p>
    <p class="Pp">For example:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    ok( $exp{9} == 81,                   'simple exponential' );
    ok( Film-&gt;can('db_Main'),            'set_db()' );
    ok( $p-&gt;tests == 4,                  'saw tests' );
    ok( !grep(!defined $_, @items),      'all items defined' );
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">(Mnemonic: &quot;This is ok.&quot;)</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">$test_name</span> is a very short description
        of the test that will be printed out. It makes it very easy to find a
        test in your script when it fails and gives others an idea of your
        intentions. <span class="Li">$test_name</span> is optional, but we
        <b>very</b> strongly encourage its use.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Should an <span class="Li">&quot;ok()&quot;</span> fail, it
        will produce some diagnostics:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    not ok 18 - sufficient mucus
    #   Failed test 'sufficient mucus'
    #   in foo.t at line 42.
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This is the same as Test::Simple's
        <span class="Li">&quot;ok()&quot;</span> routine.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>is</b></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>isnt</b></dt>
  <dd><span class="Li"></span>
    <pre>
  is  ( $got, $expected, $test_name );
  isnt( $got, $expected, $test_name );
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Similar to <span class="Li">&quot;ok()&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;is()&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;isnt()&quot;</span> compare their two arguments
        with <span class="Li">&quot;eq&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;ne&quot;</span> respectively and use the result
        of that to determine if the test succeeded or failed. So these:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    # Is the ultimate answer 42?
    is( ultimate_answer(), 42,          &quot;Meaning of Life&quot; );

    # $foo isn't empty
    isnt( $foo, '',     &quot;Got some foo&quot; );
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">are similar to these:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    ok( ultimate_answer() eq 42,        &quot;Meaning of Life&quot; );
    ok( $foo ne '',     &quot;Got some foo&quot; );
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> will only ever match
        <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span>. So you can test a value
        against <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> like this:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    is($not_defined, undef, &quot;undefined as expected&quot;);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">(Mnemonic: &quot;This is that.&quot; &quot;This isn't
        that.&quot;)</p>
    <p class="Pp">So why use these? They produce better diagnostics on failure.
        <span class="Li">&quot;ok()&quot;</span> cannot know what you are
        testing for (beyond the name), but
        <span class="Li">&quot;is()&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;isnt()&quot;</span> know what the test was and
        why it failed. For example this test:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    my $foo = 'waffle';  my $bar = 'yarblokos';
    is( $foo, $bar,   'Is foo the same as bar?' );
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Will produce something like this:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    not ok 17 - Is foo the same as bar?
    #   Failed test 'Is foo the same as bar?'
    #   in foo.t at line 139.
    #          got: 'waffle'
    #     expected: 'yarblokos'
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">So you can figure out what went wrong without rerunning the
        test.</p>
    <p class="Pp">You are encouraged to use
        <span class="Li">&quot;is()&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;isnt()&quot;</span> over
        <span class="Li">&quot;ok()&quot;</span> where possible, however do not
        be tempted to use them to find out if something is true or false!</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
  # XXX BAD!
  is( exists $brooklyn{tree}, 1, 'A tree grows in Brooklyn' );
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This does not check if <span class="Li">&quot;exists
        $brooklyn{tree}&quot;</span> is true, it checks if it returns 1. Very
        different. Similar caveats exist for false and 0. In these cases, use
        <span class="Li">&quot;ok()&quot;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
  ok( exists $brooklyn{tree},    'A tree grows in Brooklyn' );
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">A simple call to <span class="Li">&quot;isnt()&quot;</span>
        usually does not provide a strong test but there are cases when you
        cannot say much more about a value than that it is different from some
        other value:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
  new_ok $obj, &quot;Foo&quot;;

  my $clone = $obj-&gt;clone;
  isa_ok $obj, &quot;Foo&quot;, &quot;Foo-&gt;clone&quot;;

  isnt $obj, $clone, &quot;clone() produces a different object&quot;;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">For those grammatical pedants out there, there's an
        <span class="Li">&quot;isn't()&quot;</span> function which is an alias
        of <span class="Li">&quot;isnt()&quot;</span>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>like</b></dt>
  <dd><span class="Li"></span>
    <pre>
  like( $got, qr/expected/, $test_name );
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Similar to <span class="Li">&quot;ok()&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;like()&quot;</span> matches
        <span class="Li">$got</span> against the regex
        <span class="Li">&quot;qr/expected/&quot;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">So this:</p>

    <pre>
    like($got, qr/expected/, 'this is like that');
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">is similar to:</p>

    <pre>
    ok( $got =~ m/expected/, 'this is like that');
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">(Mnemonic &quot;This is like that&quot;.)</p>
    <p class="Pp">The second argument is a regular expression. It may be given
        as a regex reference (i.e. <span class="Li">&quot;qr//&quot;</span>) or
        (for better compatibility with older perls) as a string that looks like
        a regex (alternative delimiters are currently not supported):</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    like( $got, '/expected/', 'this is like that' );
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Regex options may be placed on the end
        (<span class="Li">'/expected/i'</span>).</p>
    <p class="Pp">Its advantages over <span class="Li">&quot;ok()&quot;</span>
        are similar to that of <span class="Li">&quot;is()&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;isnt()&quot;</span>. Better diagnostics on

  unlike( $got, qr/expected/, $test_name );
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Works exactly as <span class="Li">&quot;like()&quot;</span>,

        <span class="Li">&quot;is()&quot;</span> lies
        <span class="Li">&quot;cmp_ok()&quot;</span>. This allows you to compare
        two arguments using any binary perl operator. The test passes if the

    cmp_ok( $got, '&amp;&amp;', $expected, 'this &amp;&amp; that' );
    ...etc...
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Its advantage over <span class="Li">&quot;ok()&quot;</span> is
        when the test fails you'll know what <span class="Li">$got</span> and
        <span class="Li">$expected</span> were:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>

    #     '23'
    #         &amp;&amp;
    #     undef
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">It's also useful in those cases where you are comparing
        numbers and <span class="Li">&quot;is()&quot;</span>'s use of
        <span class="Li">&quot;eq&quot;</span> will interfere:</p>

    <pre>
    cmp_ok( $big_hairy_number, '==', $another_big_hairy_number );
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">It's especially useful when comparing greater-than or

Sometimes you want to test if a module, or a list of modules, can successfully

Not everything is a simple eq check or regex. There are times you need to see if
  two data structures are equivalent. For these instances Test::More provides a

        that if <span class="Li">$got</span> and
        <span class="Li">$expected</span> are references, it does a deep
        comparison walking each data structure to see if they are equivalent. If
        the two structures are different, it will display the place where they
        start differing.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;is_deeply()&quot;</span> compares the
        dereferenced values of references, the references themselves (except for
        their type) are ignored. This means aspects such as blessing and ties
        are not considered &quot;different&quot;.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;is_deeply()&quot;</span> currently has
        very limited handling of function reference and globs. It merely checks
        if they have the same referent. This may improve in the future.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Test::Differences and Test::Deep provide more in-depth

<h2 class="Ss" id="Conditional_tests"><a class="permalink" href="#Conditional_tests">Conditional
  tests</a></h2>
Sometimes running a test under certain conditions will cause the test script to
  die. A certain function or method isn't implemented (such as
  <span class="Li">&quot;fork()&quot;</span> on MacOS), some resource isn't
  available (like a net connection) or a module isn't available. In these cases
  it's necessary to skip tests, or declare that they are supposed to fail but
  will work in the future (a todo test).
<p class="Pp">For more details on the mechanics of skip and todo tests see
    Test::Harness.</p>
<p class="Pp">The way Test::More handles this is with a named block. Basically,
    a block of tests which can be skipped over or made todo. It's best if I just
    show you...</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>SKIP: BLOCK</b></dt>

  SKIP: {
      skip $why, $how_many if $condition;

      ...normal testing code goes here...
  }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This declares a block of tests that might be skipped,
        <span class="Li">$how_many</span> tests there are,
        <span class="Li">$why</span> and under what
        <span class="Li">$condition</span> to skip them. An example is the
        easiest way to illustrate:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    SKIP: {
        eval { require HTML::Lint };

        skip &quot;HTML::Lint not installed&quot;, 2 if $@;

        my $lint = new HTML::Lint;
        isa_ok( $lint, &quot;HTML::Lint&quot; );

        $lint-&gt;parse( $html );
        is( $lint-&gt;errors, 0, &quot;No errors found in HTML&quot; );
    }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If the user does not have HTML::Lint installed, the whole
        block of code <i>won't be run at all</i>. Test::More will output special
        ok's which Test::Harness interprets as skipped, but passing, tests.</p>
    <p class="Pp">It's important that <span class="Li">$how_many</span>
        accurately reflects the number of tests in the SKIP block so the # of
        tests run will match up with your plan. If your plan is
        <span class="Li">&quot;no_plan&quot;</span>
        <span class="Li">$how_many</span> is optional and will default to 1.</p>
    <p class="Pp">It's perfectly safe to nest SKIP blocks. Each SKIP block must
        have the label <span class="Li">&quot;SKIP&quot;</span>, or Test::More
        can't work its magic.</p>
    <p class="Pp">You don't skip tests which are failing because there's a bug
        in your program, or for which you don't yet have code written. For that
        you use TODO. Read on.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>TODO: BLOCK</b></dt>
  <dd><span class="Li"></span>
    <pre>
    TODO: {
        local $TODO = $why if $condition;

        ...normal testing code goes here...
    }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Declares a block of tests you expect to fail and
        <span class="Li">$why</span>. Perhaps it's because you haven't fixed a
        bug or haven't finished a new feature:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    TODO: {
        local $TODO = &quot;URI::Geller not finished&quot;;

        my $card = &quot;Eight of clubs&quot;;
        is( URI::Geller-&gt;your_card, $card, 'Is THIS your card?' );

        my $spoon;
        URI::Geller-&gt;bend_spoon;
        is( $spoon, 'bent',    &quot;Spoon bending, that's original&quot; );
    }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">With a todo block, the tests inside are expected to fail.
        Test::More will run the tests normally, but print out special flags
        indicating they are &quot;todo&quot;. Test::Harness will interpret
        failures as being ok. Should anything succeed, it will report it as an
        unexpected success. You then know the thing you had todo is done and can
        remove the TODO flag.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The nice part about todo tests, as opposed to simply
        commenting out a block of tests, is it's like having a programmatic todo
        list. You know how much work is left to be done, you're aware of what
        bugs there are, and you'll know immediately when they're fixed.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Once a todo test starts succeeding, simply move it outside the
        block. When the block is empty, delete it.</p>
  </dd>

        todo_skip $why, $how_many if $condition;

        ...normal testing code...
    }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">With todo tests, it's best to have the tests actually run.
        That way you'll know when they start passing. Sometimes this isn't
        possible. Often a failing test will cause the whole program to die or
        hang, even inside an <span class="Li">&quot;eval BLOCK&quot;</span> with
        and using <span class="Li">&quot;alarm&quot;</span>. In these extreme
        cases you have no choice but to skip over the broken tests entirely.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The syntax and behavior is similar to a
        <span class="Li">&quot;SKIP: BLOCK&quot;</span> except the tests will be
        marked as failing but todo. Test::Harness will interpret them as
        passing.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>When do I use SKIP vs. TODO?</dt>
  <dd><b>If it's something the user might not be able to do</b>, use SKIP. This
      includes optional modules that aren't installed, running under an OS that
      doesn't have some feature (like <span class="Li">&quot;fork()&quot;</span>
      or symlinks), or maybe you need an Internet connection and one isn't
      available.
    <p class="Pp"><b>If it's something the programmer hasn't done yet</b>, use
        TODO. This is for any code you haven't written yet, or bugs you have yet

The use of the following functions is discouraged as they are not actually
  testing functions and produce no diagnostics to help figure out what went
  wrong. They were written before
  <span class="Li">&quot;is_deeply()&quot;</span> existed because I couldn't
  figure out how to display a useful diff of two arbitrary data structures.
<p class="Pp">These functions are usually used inside an

Sometimes the Test::More interface isn't quite enough. Fortunately, Test::More
  is built on top of Test::Builder which provides a single, unified backend for
  any test library to use. This means two test libraries which both use
  &lt;Test::Builder&gt; <b>can</b> be used together in the same program&gt;.
<p class="Pp">If you simply want to do a little tweaking of how the tests
    behave, you can access the underlying Test::Builder object like so:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>builder</b></dt>
  <dd><span class="Li"></span>
    <pre>
    my $test_builder = Test::More-&gt;builder;

<h1 class="Sh" id="EXIT_CODES"><a class="permalink" href="#EXIT_CODES">EXIT

If all your tests passed, Test::Builder will exit with zero (which is normal).
  If anything failed it will exit with how many failed. If you run less (or
  more) tests than you planned, the missing (or extras) will be considered
  failures. If no tests were ever run Test::Builder will throw a warning and
  exit with 255. If the test died, even after having successfully completed all
  its tests, it will still be considered a failure and will exit with 255.
<p class="Pp">So the exit codes are...</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    0                   all tests successful
    255                 test died or all passed but wrong # of tests run
    any other number    how many failed (including missing or extras)
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If you fail more than 254 tests, it will be reported as 254.</p>

Test::More works with Perls as old as 5.8.1.
<p class="Pp">Thread support is not very reliable before 5.10.1, but that's
    because threads are not very reliable before 5.10.1.</p>
<p class="Pp">Although Test::More has been a core module in versions of Perl
    since 5.6.2, Test::More has evolved since then, and not all of the features
    you're used to will be present in the shipped version of Test::More. If you
    are writing a module, don't forget to indicate in your package metadata the
    minimum version of Test::More that you require. For instance, if you want to
    use <span class="Li">&quot;done_testing()&quot;</span> but want your test
    script to run on Perl 5.10.0, you will need to explicitly require Test::More
    &gt; 0.88.</p>
<p class="Pp">Key feature milestones include:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>subtests</dt>
  <dd>Subtests were released in Test::More 0.94, which came with Perl 5.12.0.
      Subtests did not implicitly call
      <span class="Li">&quot;done_testing()&quot;</span> until 0.96; the first
      Perl with that fix was Perl 5.14.0 with 0.98.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;done_testing()&quot;</dt>
  <dd>This was released in Test::More 0.88 and first shipped with Perl in 5.10.1
      as part of Test::More 0.92.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;cmp_ok()&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Although <span class="Li">&quot;cmp_ok()&quot;</span> was introduced in
      0.40, 0.86 fixed an important bug to make it safe for overloaded objects;
      the fixed first shipped with Perl in 5.10.1 as part of Test::More
    0.92.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;new_ok()&quot; &quot;note()&quot; and &quot;explain()&quot;</dt>
  <dd>These were was released in Test::More 0.82, and first shipped with Perl in
      5.10.1 as part of Test::More 0.92.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">There is a full version history in the Changes file, and the
    Test::More versions included as core can be found using
  Module::CoreList:</p>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>utf8 / &quot;Wide character in print&quot;</dt>
  <dd>If you use utf8 or other non-ASCII characters with Test::More you might
      get a &quot;Wide character in print&quot; warning. Using
      <span class="Li">&quot;binmode STDOUT, &quot;:utf8&quot;&quot;</span> will
      not fix it. Test::Builder (which powers Test::More) duplicates STDOUT and
      STDERR. So any changes to them, including changing their output
      disciplines, will not be seem by Test::More.
    <p class="Pp">One work around is to apply encodings to STDOUT and STDERR as
        early as possible and before Test::More (or any other Test module)
        loads.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    use open ':std', ':encoding(utf8)';
    use Test::More;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">A more direct work around is to change the filehandles used by
        Test::Builder.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    my $builder = Test::More-&gt;builder;
    binmode $builder-&gt;output,         &quot;:encoding(utf8)&quot;;
    binmode $builder-&gt;failure_output, &quot;:encoding(utf8)&quot;;
    binmode $builder-&gt;todo_output,    &quot;:encoding(utf8)&quot;;
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>Overloaded objects</dt>
  <dd>String overloaded objects are compared <b>as strings</b> (or in
      <span class="Li">&quot;cmp_ok()&quot;</span>'s case, strings or numbers as
      appropriate to the comparison op). This prevents Test::More from piercing
      an object's interface allowing better blackbox testing. So if a function
      starts returning overloaded objects instead of bare strings your tests
      won't notice the difference. This is good.
    <p class="Pp">However, it does mean that functions like
        <span class="Li">&quot;is_deeply()&quot;</span> cannot be used to test
        the internals of string overloaded objects. In this case I would suggest
        Test::Deep which contains more flexible testing functions for complex
        data structures.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Threads</dt>
  <dd>Test::More will only be aware of threads if <span class="Li">&quot;use
      threads&quot;</span> has been done <i>before</i> Test::More is loaded.
      This is ok:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    use threads;
    use Test::More;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This may cause problems:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    use Test::More
    use threads;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">5.8.1 and above are supported. Anything below that has too
        many bugs.</p>

This is a case of convergent evolution with Joshua Pritikin's Test module. I was
  largely unaware of its existence when I'd first written my own
  <span class="Li">&quot;ok()&quot;</span> routines. This module exists because
  I can't figure out how to easily wedge test names into Test's interface (along
  with a few other problems).
<p class="Pp">The goal here is to have a testing utility that's simple to learn,
    quick to use and difficult to trip yourself up with while still providing
    more flexibility than the existing Test.pm. As such, the names of the most
    common routines are kept tiny, special cases and magic side-effects are kept
    to a minimum. WYSIWYG.</p>
