<h2 class="Ss" id="The_Syntax_of_Variable_Names"><a class="permalink" href="#The_Syntax_of_Variable_Names">The
  Syntax of Variable Names</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Variable names in Perl can have several formats. Usually, they
    must begin with a letter or underscore, in which case they can be
    arbitrarily long (up to an internal limit of 251 characters) and may contain
    letters, digits, underscores, or the special sequence
    <span class="Li">&quot;::&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;'&quot;</span>. In this case, the part before the
    last <span class="Li">&quot;::&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;'&quot;</span> is taken to be a <i>package
    qualifier</i>; see perlmod. A Unicode letter that is not ASCII is not
    considered to be a letter unless
    <span class="Li">&quot;use&#x00A0;utf8&quot;</span> is in effect, and
    somewhat more complicated rules apply; see &quot;Identifier parsing&quot; in
    perldata for details.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl variable names may also be a sequence of digits, a single
    punctuation character, or the two-character sequence:
    <span class="Li">&quot;^&quot;</span> (caret or CIRCUMFLEX ACCENT) followed
    by any one of the characters
    <span class="Li">&quot;[][A-Z^_?\]&quot;</span>. These names are all
    reserved for special uses by Perl; for example, the all-digits names are
    used to hold data captured by backreferences after a regular expression
    match.</p>
<p class="Pp">Since Perl v5.6.0, Perl variable names may also be alphanumeric
    strings preceded by a caret. These must all be written in the form
    <span class="Li">&quot;${^Foo}&quot;</span>; the braces are not optional.
    <span class="Li">&quot;${^Foo}&quot;</span> denotes the scalar variable
    whose name is considered to be a
    control-<span class="Li">&quot;F&quot;</span> followed by two
    <span class="Li">&quot;o&quot;</span>'s. These variables are reserved for
    future special uses by Perl, except for the ones that begin with
    <span class="Li">&quot;^_&quot;</span> (caret-underscore). No name that
    begins with <span class="Li">&quot;^_&quot;</span> will acquire a special
    meaning in any future version of Perl; such names may therefore be used
    safely in programs. <span class="Li">$^_</span> itself, however, <i>is</i>
    reserved.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl identifiers that begin with digits or punctuation characters
    are exempt from the effects of the
    <span class="Li">&quot;package&quot;</span> declaration and are always
    forced to be in package <span class="Li">&quot;main&quot;</span>; they are
    also exempt from <span class="Li">&quot;strict 'vars'&quot;</span> errors. A
    few other names are also exempt in these ways:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    ENV      STDIN
    INC      STDOUT
    ARGV     STDERR
    ARGVOUT
    SIG
</pre>
<p class="Pp">In particular, the special
    <span class="Li">&quot;${^_XYZ}&quot;</span> variables are always taken to
    be in package <span class="Li">&quot;main&quot;</span>, regardless of any
    <span class="Li">&quot;package&quot;</span> declarations presently in
  scope.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="SPECIAL_VARIABLES"><a class="permalink" href="#SPECIAL_VARIABLES">SPECIAL
  VARIABLES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The following names have special meaning to Perl. Most punctuation
    names have reasonable mnemonics, or analogs in the shells. Nevertheless, if
    you wish to use long variable names, you need only say:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    use English;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">at the top of your program. This aliases all the short names to
    the long names in the current package. Some even have medium names,
    generally borrowed from <b>awk</b>. For more info, please see English.</p>
<p class="Pp">Before you continue, note the sort order for variables. In
    general, we first list the variables in case-insensitive,
    almost-lexigraphical order (ignoring the
    <span class="Li">&quot;{&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;^&quot;</span> preceding words, as in
    <span class="Li">&quot;${^UNICODE}&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">$^T</span>), although <span class="Li">$_</span> and
    <span class="Li">@_</span> move up to the top of the pile. For variables
    with the same identifier, we list it in order of scalar, array, hash, and
    bareword.</p>

<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">$_</span> is a global variable.</p>
<p class="Pp">However, between perl v5.10.0 and v5.24.0, it could be used

    <span class="Li">$_</span> refer to the global <span class="Li">$_</span> in
    the same scope was then possible with <span class="Li">&quot;our

  <dd>The process number of the Perl running this script. Though you <i>can</i>

      invaluable for some testing purposes. It will be reset automatically
      across <span class="Li">&quot;fork()&quot;</span> calls.
    <p class="Pp">Note for Linux and Debian GNU/kFreeBSD users: Before Perl
        v5.16.0 perl would emulate POSIX semantics on Linux systems using
        LinuxThreads, a partial implementation of POSIX Threads that has since
        been superseded by the Native POSIX Thread Library (NPTL).</p>
    <p class="Pp">LinuxThreads is now obsolete on Linux, and caching
        <span class="Li">&quot;getpid()&quot;</span> like this made embedding
        perl unnecessarily complex (since you'd have to manually update the
        value of $$), so now <span class="Li">$$</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;getppid()&quot;</span> will always return the
        same values as the underlying C library.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Debian GNU/kFreeBSD systems also used LinuxThreads up until
        and including the 6.0 release, but after that moved to FreeBSD thread
        semantics, which are POSIX-like.</p>
    <p class="Pp">To see if your system is affected by this discrepancy check if
        <span class="Li">&quot;getconf GNU_LIBPTHREAD_VERSION | grep -q
        NPTL&quot;</span> returns a false value. NTPL threads preserve the POSIX
        semantics.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Mnemonic: same as shells.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>$PROGRAM_NAME</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>$0</dt>
  <dd>Contains the name of the program being executed.
    <p class="Pp">On some (but not all) operating systems assigning to
        <span class="Li">$0</span> modifies the argument area that the
        <span class="Li">&quot;ps&quot;</span> program sees. On some platforms
        you may have to use special <span class="Li">&quot;ps&quot;</span>
        options or a different <span class="Li">&quot;ps&quot;</span> to see the
        changes. Modifying the <span class="Li">$0</span> is more useful as a
        way of indicating the current program state than it is for hiding the
        program you're running.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that there are platform-specific limitations on the
        maximum length of <span class="Li">$0</span>. In the most extreme case
        it may be limited to the space occupied by the original
        <span class="Li">$0</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">In some platforms there may be arbitrary amount of padding,
        for example space characters, after the modified name as shown by
        <span class="Li">&quot;ps&quot;</span>. In some platforms this padding
        may extend all the way to the original length of the argument area, no
        matter what you do (this is the case for example with Linux 2.2).</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note for BSD users: setting <span class="Li">$0</span> does
        not completely remove &quot;perl&quot; from the <b>ps</b>(1) output. For
        example, setting <span class="Li">$0</span> to
        <span class="Li">&quot;foobar&quot;</span> may result in
        <span class="Li">&quot;perl: foobar (perl)&quot;</span> (whether both
        the <span class="Li">&quot;perl: &quot;</span> prefix and the &quot;
        (perl)&quot; suffix are shown depends on your exact BSD variant and
        version). This is an operating system feature, Perl cannot help it.</p>
    <p class="Pp">In multithreaded scripts Perl coordinates the threads so that
        any thread may modify its copy of the <span class="Li">$0</span> and the
        change becomes visible to <b>ps</b>(1) (assuming the operating system
        plays along). Note that the view of <span class="Li">$0</span> the other
        threads have will not change since they have their own copies of it.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If the program has been given to perl via the switches
        <span class="Li">&quot;-e&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;-E&quot;</span>, <span class="Li">$0</span> will
        contain the string <span class="Li">&quot;-e&quot;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">On Linux as of perl v5.14.0 the legacy process name will be
        set with <span class="Li">prctl(2)</span>, in addition to altering the
        POSIX name via <span class="Li">&quot;argv[0]&quot;</span> as perl has
        done since version 4.000. Now system utilities that read the legacy
        process name such as ps, top and killall will recognize the name you set
        when assigning to <span class="Li">$0</span>. The string you supply will
        be cut off at 16 bytes, this is a limitation imposed by Linux.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Mnemonic: same as <b>sh</b> and <b>ksh</b>.</p>

  <dt>$REAL_GROUP_ID</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>$GID</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>$(</dt>
  <dd>The real gid of this process. If you are on a machine that supports
      membership in multiple groups simultaneously, gives a space separated list
      of groups you are in. The first number is the one returned by
      <span class="Li">&quot;getgid()&quot;</span>, and the subsequent ones by
      <span class="Li">&quot;getgroups()&quot;</span>, one of which may be the
      same as the first number.
    <p class="Pp">However, a value assigned to <span class="Li">$(</span> must
        be a single number used to set the real gid. So the value given by
        <span class="Li">$(</span> should <i>not</i> be assigned back to
        <span class="Li">$(</span> without being forced numeric, such as by
        adding zero. Note that this is different to the effective gid
        (<span class="Li">$)</span>) which does take a list.</p>
    <p class="Pp">You can change both the real gid and the effective gid at the
        same time by using <span class="Li">&quot;POSIX::setgid()&quot;</span>.
        Changes to <span class="Li">$(</span> require a check to
        <span class="Li">$!</span> to detect any possible errors after an
        attempted change.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Mnemonic: parentheses are used to <i>group</i> things. The

      same as the first number.
    <p class="Pp">Similarly, a value assigned to <span class="Li">$)</span> must
        also be a space-separated list of numbers. The first number sets the
        effective gid, and the rest (if any) are passed to
        <span class="Li">&quot;setgroups()&quot;</span>. To get the effect of an
        empty list for <span class="Li">&quot;setgroups()&quot;</span>, just
        repeat the new effective gid; that is, to force an effective gid of 5
        and an effectively empty <span class="Li">&quot;setgroups()&quot;</span>
        list, say <span class="Li">&quot; $) = &quot;5 5&quot;

    $SIG{'INT'}  = 'DEFAULT';   # restore default action
    $SIG{'QUIT'} = 'IGNORE';    # ignore SIGQUIT
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Using a value of <span class="Li">'IGNORE'</span> usually has

        <span class="Li">&quot;CHLD&quot;</span> signal. See perlipc for more
        about this special case.</p>

    $SIG{&quot;PIPE&quot;} = Plumber();   # oops, what did Plumber()
                                # return??
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Be sure not to use a bareword as the name of a signal handler,
        lest you inadvertently call it.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If your system has the
        <span class="Li">&quot;sigaction()&quot;</span> function then signal
        handlers are installed using it. This means you get reliable signal
        handling.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The default delivery policy of signals changed in Perl v5.8.0
        from immediate (also known as &quot;unsafe&quot;) to deferred, also
        known as &quot;safe signals&quot;. See perlipc for more information.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Certain internal hooks can be also set using the
        <span class="Li">%SIG</span> hash. The routine indicated by
        <span class="Li">$SIG{__WARN__}</span> is called when a warning message
        is about to be printed. The warning message is passed as the first
        argument. The presence of a <span class="Li">&quot;__WARN__&quot;</span>
        hook causes the ordinary printing of warnings to
        <span class="Li">&quot;STDERR&quot;</span> to be suppressed. You can use
        this to save warnings in a variable, or turn warnings into fatal errors,
        like this:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    local $SIG{__WARN__} = sub { die $_[0] };
    eval $proggie;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">As the <span class="Li">'IGNORE'</span> hook is not supported
        by <span class="Li">&quot;__WARN__&quot;</span>, you can disable
        warnings using the empty subroutine:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    local $SIG{__WARN__} = sub {};
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The routine indicated by <span class="Li">$SIG{__DIE__}</span>
        is called when a fatal exception is about to be thrown. The error
        message is passed as the first argument. When a
        <span class="Li">&quot;__DIE__&quot;</span> hook routine returns, the
        exception processing continues as it would have in the absence of the
        hook, unless the hook routine itself exits via a
        <span class="Li">&quot;goto &amp;sub&quot;</span>, a loop exit, or a
        <span class="Li">&quot;die()&quot;</span>. The
        <span class="Li">&quot;__DIE__&quot;</span> handler is explicitly
        disabled during the call, so that you can die from a
        <span class="Li">&quot;__DIE__&quot;</span> handler. Similarly for
        <span class="Li">&quot;__WARN__&quot;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">$SIG{__DIE__}</span> hook is called even
        inside an <span class="Li">&quot;eval()&quot;</span>. It was never
        intended to happen this way, but an implementation glitch made this
        possible. This used to be deprecated, as it allowed strange action at a
        distance like rewriting a pending exception in
        <span class="Li">$@</span>. Plans to rectify this have been scrapped, as
        users found that rewriting a pending exception is actually a useful
        feature, and not a bug.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;__DIE__&quot;</span>/<span class="Li">&quot;__WARN__&quot;</span>
        handlers are very special in one respect: they may be called to report
        (probable) errors found by the parser. In such a case the parser may be
        in inconsistent state, so any attempt to evaluate Perl code from such a
        handler will probably result in a segfault. This means that warnings or
        errors that result from parsing Perl should be used with extreme
        caution, like this:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    require Carp if defined $^S;
    Carp::confess(&quot;Something wrong&quot;) if defined &amp;Carp::confess;
    die &quot;Something wrong, but could not load Carp to give &quot;
      . &quot;backtrace...\n\t&quot;
      . &quot;To see backtrace try starting Perl with -MCarp switch&quot;;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Here the first line will load
        <span class="Li">&quot;Carp&quot;</span> <i>unless</i> it is the parser
        who called the handler. The second line will print backtrace and die if
        <span class="Li">&quot;Carp&quot;</span> was available. The third line
        will be executed only if <span class="Li">&quot;Carp&quot;</span> was
        not available.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Having to even think about the <span class="Li">$^S</span>
        variable in your exception handlers is simply wrong.
        <span class="Li">$SIG{__DIE__}</span> as currently implemented invites
        grievous and difficult to track down errors. Avoid it and use an
        <span class="Li">&quot;END{}&quot;</span> or CORE::GLOBAL::die override
        instead.</p>
    <p class="Pp">See &quot;die&quot; in perlfunc, &quot;warn&quot; in perlfunc,

        overloads operators, allowing easy comparison against other version
        representations (e.g. decimal, literal v-string, &quot;v1.2.3&quot;, or
        objects). The disadvantage is that prior to v5.10.0, it was only a
        literal v-string, which can't be easily printed or compared, whereas the
        behavior of <span class="Li">$]</span> is unchanged on all versions of

      On the other hand, not opening the file is considerably faster, especially

    <p class="Pp">Depending on the host operating system, the value of
        <span class="Li">$^X</span> may be a relative or absolute pathname of
        the perl program file, or may be the string used to invoke perl but not
        the pathname of the perl program file. Also, most operating systems
        permit invoking programs that are not in the PATH environment variable,
        so there is no guarantee that the value of <span class="Li">$^X</span>
        is in PATH. For VMS, the value may or may not include a version

    <p class="Pp">You usually can use the value of <span class="Li">$^X</span>

    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    @first_run = `$^X -le &quot;print int rand 100 for 1..100&quot;`;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">But recall that not all operating systems support forking or
        capturing of the output of commands, so this complex statement may not
        be portable.</p>
    <p class="Pp">It is not safe to use the value of <span class="Li">$^X</span>
        as a path name of a file, as some operating systems that have a
        mandatory suffix on executable files do not require use of the suffix
        when invoking a command. To convert the value of
        <span class="Li">$^X</span> to a path name, use the following

    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Because many operating systems permit anyone with read access
        to the Perl program file to make a copy of it, patch the copy, and then
        execute the copy, the security-conscious Perl programmer should take

<h2 class="Ss" id="Variables_related_to_regular_expressions"><a class="permalink" href="#Variables_related_to_regular_expressions">Variables
  related to regular expressions</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Most of the special variables related to regular expressions are
    side effects. Perl sets these variables when it has a successful match, so
    you should check the match result before using them. For instance:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    if( /P(A)TT(ER)N/ ) {
        print &quot;I found $1 and $2\n&quot;;
        }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">These variables are read-only and dynamically-scoped, unless we
    note otherwise.</p>
<p class="Pp">The dynamic nature of the regular expression variables means that
    their value is limited to the block that they are in, as demonstrated by
    this bit of code:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    my $outer = 'Wallace and Grommit';
    my $inner = 'Mutt and Jeff';
    my $pattern = qr/(\S+) and (\S+)/;
    sub show_n { print &quot;\$1 is $1; \$2 is $2\n&quot; }
    {
    OUTER:
        show_n() if $outer =~ m/$pattern/;
        INNER: {
            show_n() if $inner =~ m/$pattern/;
            }
        show_n();
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The output shows that while in the
    <span class="Li">&quot;OUTER&quot;</span> block, the values of
    <span class="Li">$1</span> and <span class="Li">$2</span> are from the match
    against <span class="Li">$outer</span>. Inside the
    <span class="Li">&quot;INNER&quot;</span> block, the values of
    <span class="Li">$1</span> and <span class="Li">$2</span> are from the match
    against <span class="Li">$inner</span>, but only until the end of the block
    (i.e. the dynamic scope). After the
    <span class="Li">&quot;INNER&quot;</span> block completes, the values of
    <span class="Li">$1</span> and <span class="Li">$2</span> return to the
    values for the match against <span class="Li">$outer</span> even though we
    have not made another match:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    $1 is Wallace; $2 is Grommit
    $1 is Mutt; $2 is Jeff
    $1 is Wallace; $2 is Grommit
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><i>Performance issues</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Traditionally in Perl, any use of any of the three variables
    <span class="Li">&quot;$`&quot;</span>, <span class="Li">$&amp;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;$'&quot;</span> (or their <span class="Li">&quot;use
    English&quot;</span> equivalents) anywhere in the code, caused all
    subsequent successful pattern matches to make a copy of the matched string,
    in case the code might subsequently access one of those variables. This
    imposed a considerable performance penalty across the whole program, so
    generally the use of these variables has been discouraged.</p>
<p class="Pp">In Perl 5.6.0 the <span class="Li">&quot;@-&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;@+&quot;</span> dynamic arrays were introduced that
    supply the indices of successful matches. So you could for example do
  this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    $str =~ /pattern/;
    print $`, $&amp;, $'; # bad: performance hit
    print             # good: no performance hit
        substr($str, 0,     $-[0]),
        substr($str, $-[0], $+[0]-$-[0]),
        substr($str, $+[0]);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">In Perl 5.10.0 the <span class="Li">&quot;/p&quot;</span> match
    operator flag and the <span class="Li">&quot;${^PREMATCH}&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;${^MATCH}&quot;</span>, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;${^POSTMATCH}&quot;</span> variables were introduced,
    that allowed you to suffer the penalties only on patterns marked with
    <span class="Li">&quot;/p&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">In Perl 5.18.0 onwards, perl started noting the presence of each
    of the three variables separately, and only copied that part of the string
    required; so in</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    $`; $&amp;; &quot;abcdefgh&quot; =~ /d/
</pre>
<p class="Pp">perl would only copy the &quot;abcd&quot; part of the string. That
    could make a big difference in something like</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    $str = 'x' x 1_000_000;
    $&amp;; # whoops
    $str =~ /x/g # one char copied a million times, not a million chars
</pre>
<p class="Pp">In Perl 5.20.0 a new copy-on-write system was enabled by default,
    which finally fixes all performance issues with these three variables, and
    makes them safe to use anywhere.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;Devel::NYTProf&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;Devel::FindAmpersand&quot;</span> modules can help
    you find uses of these problematic match variables in your code.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Variables_related_to_filehandles"><a class="permalink" href="#Variables_related_to_filehandles">Variables
  related to filehandles</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Variables that depend on the currently selected filehandle may be
    set by calling an appropriate object method on the
    <span class="Li">&quot;IO::Handle&quot;</span> object, although this is less
    efficient than using the regular built-in variables. (Summary lines below
    for this contain the word HANDLE.) First you must say</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    use IO::Handle;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">after which you may use either</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    method HANDLE EXPR
</pre>
<p class="Pp">or more safely,</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    HANDLE-&gt;method(EXPR)
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Each method returns the old value of the
    <span class="Li">&quot;IO::Handle&quot;</span> attribute. The methods each
    take an optional EXPR, which, if supplied, specifies the new value for the
    <span class="Li">&quot;IO::Handle&quot;</span> attribute in question. If not
    supplied, most methods do nothing to the current value--except for
    <span class="Li">&quot;autoflush()&quot;</span>, which will assume a 1 for
    you, just to be different.</p>
<p class="Pp">Because loading in the
    <span class="Li">&quot;IO::Handle&quot;</span> class is an expensive
    operation, you should learn how to use the regular built-in variables.</p>
<p class="Pp">A few of these variables are considered &quot;read-only&quot;.
    This means that if you try to assign to this variable, either directly or
    indirectly through a reference, you'll raise a run-time exception.</p>
<p class="Pp">You should be very careful when modifying the default values of
    most special variables described in this document. In most cases you want to
    localize these variables before changing them, since if you don't, the
    change may affect other modules which rely on the default values of the
    special variables that you have changed. This is one of the correct ways to
    read the whole file at once:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    open my $fh, &quot;&lt;&quot;, &quot;foo&quot; or die $!;
    local $/; # enable localized slurp mode
    my $content = &lt;$fh&gt;;
    close $fh;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">But the following code is quite bad:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    open my $fh, &quot;&lt;&quot;, &quot;foo&quot; or die $!;
    undef $/; # enable slurp mode
    my $content = &lt;$fh&gt;;
    close $fh;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">since some other module, may want to read data from some file in
    the default &quot;line mode&quot;, so if the code we have just presented has
    been executed, the global value of <span class="Li">$/</span> is now changed
    for any other code running inside the same Perl interpreter.</p>
<p class="Pp">Usually when a variable is localized you want to make sure that
    this change affects the shortest scope possible. So unless you are already
    inside some short <span class="Li">&quot;{}&quot;</span> block, you should
    create one yourself. For example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    my $content = '';
    open my $fh, &quot;&lt;&quot;, &quot;foo&quot; or die $!;
    {
        local $/;
        $content = &lt;$fh&gt;;
    }
    close $fh;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Here is an example of how your own code can go broken:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    for ( 1..3 ){
        $\ = &quot;\r\n&quot;;
        nasty_break();
        print &quot;$_&quot;;
    }
    sub nasty_break {
        $\ = &quot;\f&quot;;
        # do something with $_
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">You probably expect this code to print the equivalent of</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    &quot;1\r\n2\r\n3\r\n&quot;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">but instead you get:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    &quot;1\f2\f3\f&quot;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Why? Because <span class="Li">&quot;nasty_break()&quot;</span>
    modifies <span class="Li">&quot;$\&quot;</span> without localizing it first.
    The value you set in <span class="Li">&quot;nasty_break()&quot;</span> is
    still there when you return. The fix is to add
    <span class="Li">&quot;local()&quot;</span> so the value doesn't leak out of
    <span class="Li">&quot;nasty_break()&quot;</span>:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    local $\ = &quot;\f&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">It's easy to notice the problem in such a short example, but in
    more complicated code you are looking for trouble if you don't localize
    changes to the special variables.</p>

    <p class="Pp">Each filehandle in Perl counts the number of lines that have

        <span class="Li">$/</span>, Perl's idea of what constitutes a line may
        not match yours.) When a line is read from a filehandle (via
        <span class="Li">&quot;readline()&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;&gt;&quot;</span>), or when
        <span class="Li">&quot;tell()&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;seek()&quot;</span> is called on it,
        <span class="Li">$.</span> becomes an alias to the line counter for that
        filehandle.</p>
    <p class="Pp">You can adjust the counter by assigning to
        <span class="Li">$.</span>, but this will not actually move the seek
        pointer. <i>Localizing </i><span class="Li"><i>$.</i></span><i> will not
        localize</i> <i>the filehandle's line count</i>. Instead, it will
        localize perl's notion of which filehandle <span class="Li">$.</span> is
        currently aliased to.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">$.</span> is reset when the filehandle is
        closed, but <b>not</b> when an open filehandle is reopened without an
        intervening <span class="Li">&quot;close()&quot;</span>. For more
        details, see &quot;I/O Operators&quot; in perlop. Because
        <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;&gt;&quot;</span> never does an explicit
        close, line numbers increase across
        <span class="Li">&quot;ARGV&quot;</span> files (but see examples in
        &quot;eof&quot; in perlfunc).</p>
    <p class="Pp">You can also use
        <span class="Li">&quot;HANDLE-&gt;input_line_number(EXPR)&quot;</span>
        to access the line counter for a given filehandle without having to
        worry about which handle you last accessed.</p>

  <dt>$INPUT_RECORD_SEPARATOR</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>$RS</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>$/</dt>
  <dd>The input record separator, newline by default. This influences Perl's
      idea of what a &quot;line&quot; is. Works like <b>awk</b>'s RS variable,
      including treating empty lines as a terminator if set to the null string
      (an empty line cannot contain any spaces or tabs). You may set it to a
      multi-character string to match a multi-character terminator, or to
      <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> to read through the end of file.
      Setting it to <span class="Li">&quot;\n\n&quot;</span> means something
      slightly different than setting to <span class="Li">&quot;&quot;</span>,
      if the file contains consecutive empty lines. Setting to
      <span class="Li">&quot;&quot;</span> will treat two or more consecutive
      empty lines as a single empty line. Setting to
      <span class="Li">&quot;\n\n&quot;</span> will blindly assume that the next
      input character belongs to the next paragraph, even if it's a newline.
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    local $/;           # enable &quot;slurp&quot; mode
    local $_ = &lt;FH&gt;;    # whole file now here
    s/\n[ \t]+/ /g;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Remember: the value of <span class="Li">$/</span> is a string,
        not a regex. <b>awk</b> has to be better for something. :-)</p>
    <p class="Pp">Setting <span class="Li">$/</span> to an empty string -- the
        so-called <i>paragraph mode</i> -- merits special attention. When
        <span class="Li">$/</span> is set to
        <span class="Li">&quot;&quot;</span> and the entire file is read in with
        that setting, any sequence of consecutive newlines
        <span class="Li">&quot;\n\n&quot;</span> at the beginning of the file is
        discarded. With the exception of the final record in the file, each
        sequence of characters ending in two or more newlines is treated as one
        record and is read in to end in exactly two newlines. If the last record
        in the file ends in zero or one consecutive newlines, that record is
        read in with that number of newlines. If the last record ends in two or
        more consecutive newlines, it is read in with two newlines like all
        preceding records.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Suppose we wrote the following string to a file:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    my $string = &quot;\n\n\n&quot;;
    $string .= &quot;alpha beta\ngamma delta\n\n\n&quot;;

    $string .= &quot;theta\n&quot;;
    my $file = 'simple_file.txt'; 
    open my $OUT, '&gt;', $file or die;
    print $OUT $string;
    close $OUT or die;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Now we read that file in paragraph mode:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    local $/ = &quot;&quot;; # paragraph mode
    open my $IN, '&lt;', $file or die;
    my @records = &lt;$IN&gt;;
    close $IN or die;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">@records</span> will consist of these 3
        strings:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    (

      &quot;epsilon zeta eta\n\n&quot;,
      &quot;theta\n&quot;,
    )

    <p class="Pp">Setting <span class="Li">$/</span> to a reference to an
        integer, scalar containing an integer, or scalar that's convertible to
        an integer will attempt to read records instead of lines, with the
        maximum record size being the referenced integer number of characters.
        So this:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    local $/ = \32768; # or \&quot;32768&quot;, or \$var_containing_32768
    open my $fh, &quot;&lt;&quot;, $myfile or die $!;

    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">will read a record of no more than 32768 characters from
        <span class="Li">$fh</span>. If you're not reading from a
        record-oriented file (or your OS doesn't have record-oriented files),
        then you'll likely get a full chunk of data with every read. If a record
        is larger than the record size you've set, you'll get the record back in
        pieces. Trying to set the record size to zero or less is deprecated and
        will cause $/ to have the value of &quot;undef&quot;, which will cause
        reading in the (rest of the) whole file.</p>
    <p class="Pp">As of 5.19.9 setting <span class="Li">$/</span> to any other
        form of reference will throw a fatal exception. This is in preparation
        for supporting new ways to set <span class="Li">$/</span> in the
      future.</p>
    <p class="Pp">On VMS only, record reads bypass PerlIO layers and any
        associated buffering, so you must not mix record and non-record reads on
        the same filehandle. Record mode mixes with line mode only when the same
        buffering layer is in use for both modes.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Error_Variables"><a class="permalink" href="#Error_Variables">Error
  Variables</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The variables <span class="Li">$@</span>,
    <span class="Li">$!</span>, <span class="Li">$^E</span>, and
    <span class="Li">$?</span> contain information about different types of
    error conditions that may appear during execution of a Perl program. The
    variables are shown ordered by the &quot;distance&quot; between the
    subsystem which reported the error and the Perl process. They correspond to
    errors detected by the Perl interpreter, C library, operating system, or an
    external program, respectively.</p>
<p class="Pp">To illustrate the differences between these variables, consider
    the following Perl expression, which uses a single-quoted string. After
    execution of this statement, perl may have set all four special error
    variables:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    eval q{
        open my $pipe, &quot;/cdrom/install |&quot; or die $!;
        my @res = &lt;$pipe&gt;;
        close $pipe or die &quot;bad pipe: $?, $!&quot;;
    };
</pre>
<p class="Pp">When perl executes the <span class="Li">&quot;eval()&quot;</span>
    expression, it translates the <span class="Li">&quot;open()&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;PIPE&gt;&quot;</span>, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;close&quot;</span> calls in the C run-time library
    and thence to the operating system kernel. perl sets
    <span class="Li">$!</span> to the C library's
    <span class="Li">&quot;errno&quot;</span> if one of these calls fails.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">$@</span> is set if the string to be
    <span class="Li">&quot;eval&quot;</span>-ed did not compile (this may happen
    if <span class="Li">&quot;open&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;close&quot;</span> were imported with bad
    prototypes), or if Perl code executed during evaluation
    <span class="Li">&quot;die()&quot;</span>d. In these cases the value of
    <span class="Li">$@</span> is the compile error, or the argument to
    <span class="Li">&quot;die&quot;</span> (which will interpolate
    <span class="Li">$!</span> and <span class="Li">$?</span>). (See also Fatal,
    though.)</p>
<p class="Pp">Under a few operating systems, <span class="Li">$^E</span> may
    contain a more verbose error indicator, such as in this case, &quot;CDROM
    tray not closed.&quot; Systems that do not support extended error messages
    leave <span class="Li">$^E</span> the same as
  <span class="Li">$!</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Finally, <span class="Li">$?</span> may be set to a non-0 value if
    the external program <i>/cdrom/install</i> fails. The upper eight bits
    reflect specific error conditions encountered by the program (the program's
    <span class="Li">&quot;exit()&quot;</span> value). The lower eight bits
    reflect mode of failure, like signal death and core dump information. See
    <b>wait</b>(2) for details. In contrast to <span class="Li">$!</span> and
    <span class="Li">$^E</span>, which are set only if an error condition is
    detected, the variable <span class="Li">$?</span> is set on each
    <span class="Li">&quot;wait&quot;</span> or pipe
    <span class="Li">&quot;close&quot;</span>, overwriting the old value. This
    is more like <span class="Li">$@</span>, which on every
    <span class="Li">&quot;eval()&quot;</span> is always set on failure and
    cleared on success.</p>
<p class="Pp">For more details, see the individual descriptions at
    <span class="Li">$@</span>, <span class="Li">$!</span>,
    <span class="Li">$^E</span>, and <span class="Li">$?</span>.</p>

      <span class="Li">&quot;system()&quot;</span> operator. On POSIX-like
      systems this value can be decoded with the WIFEXITED, WEXITSTATUS,
      WIFSIGNALED, WTERMSIG, WIFSTOPPED, WSTOPSIG and WIFCONTINUED functions
      provided by the POSIX module.
    <p class="Pp">Under VMS this reflects the actual VMS exit status; i.e. it is

      OS/2, and Win32 (and for MacPerl). On all other platforms,
      <span class="Li">$^E</span> is always just the same as
      <span class="Li">$!</span>.
    <p class="Pp">Under VMS, <span class="Li">$^E</span> provides the VMS status
        value from the last system error. This is more specific information
        about the last system error than that provided by
        <span class="Li">$!</span>. This is particularly important when
        <span class="Li">$!</span> is set to <b>EVMSERR</b>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Under OS/2, <span class="Li">$^E</span> is set to the error
        code of the last call to OS/2 API either via CRT, or directly from
      perl.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Under Win32, <span class="Li">$^E</span> always returns the
        last error information reported by the Win32 call
        <span class="Li">&quot;GetLastError()&quot;</span> which describes the
        last error from within the Win32 API. Most Win32-specific code will
        report errors via <span class="Li">$^E</span>. ANSI C and Unix-like
        calls set <span class="Li">&quot;errno&quot;</span> and so most portable
        Perl code will report errors via <span class="Li">$!</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Caveats mentioned in the description of

      stored in <span class="Li">&quot;errno&quot;</span>. When referenced as a
      string, <span class="Li">$!</span> yields the system error string
      corresponding to <span class="Li">&quot;errno&quot;</span>.
    <p class="Pp">Many system or library calls set
        <span class="Li">&quot;errno&quot;</span> if they fail, to indicate the
        cause of failure. They usually do <b>not</b> set
        <span class="Li">&quot;errno&quot;</span> to zero if they succeed. This

<p class="Pp">This variable was added in Perl 5.14.0.</p>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>$^H</dt>
  <dd>WARNING: This variable is strictly for internal use only. Its
      availability, behavior, and contents are subject to change without notice.
    <p class="Pp">This variable contains compile-time hints for the Perl
        interpreter. At the end of compilation of a BLOCK the value of this
        variable is restored to the value when the interpreter started to
        compile the BLOCK.</p>
    <p class="Pp">When perl begins to parse any block construct that provides a
        lexical scope (e.g., eval body, required file, subroutine body, loop
        body, or conditional block), the existing value of
        <span class="Li">$^H</span> is saved, but its value is left unchanged.
        When the compilation of the block is completed, it regains the saved
        value. Between the points where its value is saved and restored, code
        that executes within BEGIN blocks is free to change the value of
        <span class="Li">$^H</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This behavior provides the semantic of lexical scoping, and is
        used in, for instance, the <span class="Li">&quot;use
        strict&quot;</span> pragma.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The contents should be an integer; different bits of it are
        used for different pragmatic flags. Here's an example:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    sub add_100 { $^H |= 0x100 }
    sub foo {
        BEGIN { add_100() }
        bar-&gt;baz($boon);
    }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Consider what happens during execution of the BEGIN block. At
        this point the BEGIN block has already been compiled, but the body of
        <span class="Li">&quot;foo()&quot;</span> is still being compiled. The
        new value of <span class="Li">$^H</span> will therefore be visible only
        while the body of <span class="Li">&quot;foo()&quot;</span> is being
        compiled.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Substitution of <span class="Li">&quot;BEGIN { add_100()
        }&quot;</span> block with:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    BEGIN { require strict; strict-&gt;import('vars') }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">demonstrates how <span class="Li">&quot;use strict
        'vars'&quot;</span> is implemented. Here's a conditional version of the
        same lexical pragma:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    BEGIN {
        require strict; strict-&gt;import('vars') if $condition
    }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This variable was added in Perl 5.003.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>%^H</dt>
  <dd>The <span class="Li">&quot;%^H&quot;</span> hash provides the same scoping
      semantic as <span class="Li">$^H</span>. This makes it useful for
      implementation of lexically scoped pragmas. See perlpragma. All the
      entries are stringified when accessed at runtime, so only simple values
      can be accommodated. This means no pointers to objects, for example.
    <p class="Pp">When putting items into
        <span class="Li">&quot;%^H&quot;</span>, in order to avoid conflicting
        with other users of the hash there is a convention regarding which keys
        to use. A module should use only keys that begin with the module's name
        (the name of its main package) and a &quot;/&quot; character. For
        example, a module <span class="Li">&quot;Foo::Bar&quot;</span> should
        use keys such as <span class="Li">&quot;Foo::Bar/baz&quot;</span>.</p>

<p class="Pp">Deprecating a variable announces the intent of the perl
    maintainers to eventually remove the variable from the language. It may
    still be available despite its status. Using a deprecated variable triggers
    a warning.</p>

    the variable is unsupported.</p>

  <dt>$[</dt>
  <dd>This variable stores the index of the first element in an array, and of
      the first character in a substring. The default is 0, but you could
      theoretically set it to 1 to make Perl behave more like <b>awk</b> (or
      Fortran) when subscripting and when evaluating the <b>index()</b> and
      <b>substr()</b> functions.
    <p class="Pp">As of release 5 of Perl, assignment to
        <span class="Li">$[</span> is treated as a compiler directive, and
        cannot influence the behavior of any other file. (That's why you can
        only assign compile-time constants to it.) Its use is highly
        discouraged.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Prior to Perl v5.10.0, assignment to
        <span class="Li">$[</span> could be seen from outer lexical scopes in
        the same file, unlike other compile-time directives (such as strict).
        Using <b>local()</b> on it would bind its value strictly to a lexical
        block. Now it is always lexically scoped.</p>
    <p class="Pp">As of Perl v5.16.0, it is implemented by the arybase
      module.</p>
    <p class="Pp">As of Perl v5.30.0, or under <span class="Li">&quot;use
        v5.16&quot;</span>, or <span class="Li">&quot;no feature
        &quot;array_base&quot;&quot;</span>, <span class="Li">$[</span> no
        longer has any effect, and always contains 0. Assigning 0 to it is
        permitted, but any other value will produce an error.</p>
