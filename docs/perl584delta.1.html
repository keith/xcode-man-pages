   Set up some character translations and predefined strings.  \*(-- will
   give an unbreakable dash, \*(PI will give pi, \*(L" will give a left
   double quote, and \*(R" will give a right double quote.  \*(C+ will
   give a nicer C++.  Capital omega is used to do unbreakable dashes and
   therefore won't be available.  \*(C` and \*(C' expand to `' in nroff,
   nothing in troff, for use with C<>.

<h1 class="Sh" id="Incompatible_Changes"><a class="permalink" href="#Incompatible_Changes">Incompatible
  Changes</a></h1>
Many minor bugs have been fixed. Scripts which happen to rely on previously
  erroneous behaviour will consider these fixes as incompatible changes :-) You
  are advised to perform sufficient acceptance testing on this release to
  satisfy yourself that this does not affect you, before putting this release
  into production.
<p class="Pp">The diagnostic output of Carp has been changed slightly, to add a
    space after the comma between arguments. This makes it much easier for tools
    such as web browsers to wrap it, but might confuse any automatic tools which
    perform detailed parsing of Carp output.</p>
<p class="Pp">The internal dump output has been improved, so that non-printable
    characters such as newline and backspace are output in
    <span class="Li">&quot;\x&quot;</span> notation, rather than octal. This
    might just confuse non-robust tools which parse the output of modules such
    as Devel::Peek.</p>

  wrapping</a></h2>
Perl can now be built to detect attempts to assign pathologically large chunks
  of memory. Previously such assignments would suffer from integer wrap-around
  during size calculations causing a misallocation, which would crash perl, and
  could theoretically be used for &quot;stack smashing&quot; attacks. The
  wrapping defaults to enabled on platforms where we know it works (most AIX
  configurations, BSDi, Darwin, DEC OSF/1, FreeBSD, HP/UX, GNU Linux, OpenBSD,
  Solaris, VMS and most Win32 compilers) and defaults to disabled on other
  platforms.

<h2 class="Ss" id="suidperl_less_insecure"><a class="permalink" href="#suidperl_less_insecure">suidperl
  less insecure</a></h2>
Paul Szabo has analysed and patched <span class="Li">&quot;suidperl&quot;</span>
  to remove existing known insecurities. Currently there are no known holes in
  <span class="Li">&quot;suidperl&quot;</span>, but previous experience shows
  that we cannot be confident that these were the last. You may no longer invoke
  the set uid perl directly, so to preserve backwards compatibility with scripts
  that invoke #!/usr/bin/suidperl the only set uid binary is now
  <span class="Li">&quot;sperl5.8.&quot;</span><i>n</i>
  (<span class="Li">&quot;sperl5.8.4&quot;</span> for this release).
  <span class="Li">&quot;suidperl&quot;</span> is installed as a hard link to
  <span class="Li">&quot;perl&quot;</span>; both
  <span class="Li">&quot;suidperl&quot;</span> and
  <span class="Li">&quot;perl&quot;</span> will invoke
  <span class="Li">&quot;sperl5.8.4&quot;</span> automatically the set uid
  binary, so this change should be completely transparent.
<p class="Pp">For new projects the core perl team would strongly recommend that
    you use dedicated, single purpose security tools such as
    <span class="Li">&quot;sudo&quot;</span> in preference to
    <span class="Li">&quot;suidperl&quot;</span>.</p>

The (mis)use of <span class="Li">&quot;/tmp&quot;</span> in core modules and
  documentation has been tidied up. Some modules available both within the perl
  core and independently from CPAN (&quot;dual-life modules&quot;) have not yet
  had these changes applied; the changes will be integrated into future stable
  perl releases as the modules are updated on CPAN.

The build process on both VMS and Windows has had several minor improvements
  made. On Windows Borland's C compiler can now compile perl with PerlIO and/or
  USE_LARGE_FILES enabled.
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;perl.exe&quot;</span> on Windows now has a
    &quot;Camel&quot; logo icon. The use of a camel with the topic of Perl is a
    trademark of O'Reilly and Associates Inc., and is used with their permission
    (ie distribution of the source, compiling a Windows executable from it, and
    using that executable locally). Use of the supplied camel for anything other
    than a perl executable's icon is specifically not covered, and anyone
    wishing to redistribute perl binaries <i>with</i> the icon should check
    directly with O'Reilly beforehand.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl should build cleanly on Stratus VOS once more.</p>

More utf8 bugs fixed, notably in how <span class="Li">&quot;chomp&quot;</span>,
  <span class="Li">&quot;chop&quot;</span>,
  <span class="Li">&quot;send&quot;</span>, and
  <span class="Li">&quot;syswrite&quot;</span> and interact with utf8 data.
  Concatenation now works correctly when <span class="Li">&quot;use
  bytes;&quot;</span> is in scope.
<p class="Pp">Pragmata are now correctly propagated into (?{...}) constructions
    in regexps. Code such as</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
   my $x = qr{ ... (??{ $x }) ... };
</pre>
<p class="Pp">will now (correctly) fail under use strict. (As the inner
    <span class="Li">$x</span> is and has always referred to
    <span class="Li">$::x</span>)</p>
<p class="Pp">The &quot;const in void context&quot; warning has been suppressed
    for a constant in an optimised-away boolean expression such as
    <span class="Li">&quot;5 || print;&quot;</span></p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;perl -i&quot;</span> could
    <span class="Li">&quot;fchmod(stdin)&quot;</span> by mistake. This is
    serious if stdin is attached to a terminal, and perl is running as root. Now

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
  posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
  http://bugs.perl.org. There may also be information at http://www.perl.org,
  the Perl Home Page.
<p class="Pp">If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the
    <b>perlbug</b> program included with your release. Be sure to trim your bug
    down to a tiny but sufficient test case. Your bug report, along with the
    output of <span class="Li">&quot;perl -V&quot;</span>, will be sent off to
    perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team. You can browse and
