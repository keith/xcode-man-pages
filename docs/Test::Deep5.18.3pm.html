If you don't know anything about automated testing in Perl then you should
  probably read about Test::Simple and Test::More before preceding. Test::Deep
  uses the Test::Builder framework.
<p class="Pp">Test::Deep gives you very flexible ways to check that the result
    you got is the result you were expecting. At it's simplest it compares two
    structures by going through each level, ensuring that the values match, that
    arrays and hashes have the same elements and that references are blessed
    into the correct class. It also handles circular data structures without
    getting caught in an infinite loop.</p>
<p class="Pp">Where it becomes more interesting is in allowing you to do
    something besides simple exact comparisons. With strings, the
    <span class="Li">&quot;eq&quot;</span> operator checks that 2 strings are
    exactly equal but sometimes that's not what you want. When you don't know
    exactly what the string should be but you do know some things about how it
    should look, <span class="Li">&quot;eq&quot;</span> is no good and you must
    use pattern matching instead. Test::Deep provides pattern matching for
    complex data structures</p>

How Test::Deep works is much easier to understand by seeing some examples.
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Without_Test::Deep"><a class="permalink" href="#Without_Test::Deep">Without
  Test::Deep</a></h2>
Say you want to test a function which returns a string. You know that your
  string should be a 7 digit number beginning with 0,
  <span class="Li">&quot;eq&quot;</span> is no good in this situation, you need
  a regular expression. So you could use Test::More's
  <span class="Li">&quot;like()&quot;</span> function:
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  like($string, '/^0d{6}$/', &quot;number looks good&quot;);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Similarly, to check that a string looks like a name, you could
  do:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  like($string, '/^(Mr|Mrs|Miss) \w+ \w+$/',
    &quot;got title, first and last name&quot;);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Now imagine your function produces a hash with some personal
    details in it. You want to make sure that there are 2 keys, Name and Phone
    and that the name looks like a name and the phone number looks like a phone
    number. You could do:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  $hash = make_person();
  like($hash-&gt;{Name}, '/^(Mr|Mrs|Miss) \w+ \w+$/', &quot;name ok&quot;);
  like($hash-&gt;{Phone}, '/^0d{6}$/', &quot;phone ok&quot;);
  is(scalar keys %$hash, 2, &quot;correct number of keys&quot;);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">But that's not quite right, what if make_person has a serious
    problem and didn't even return a hash? We really need to write</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  if (ref($hash) eq &quot;HASH&quot;)
  {
    like($hash-&gt;{Name}, '/^(Mr|Mrs|Miss) \w+ \w+$/', &quot;name ok&quot;);
    like($hash-&gt;{Phone}, '/^0d{6}$/', &quot;phone ok&quot;);
    is(scalar keys %$hash, 2, &quot;correct number of keys&quot;);
  }
  else
  {
    fail(&quot;person not a hash&quot;);
    fail(&quot;person not a hash&quot;);
    fail(&quot;person not a hash&quot;); # need 3 to keep the plan correct
  }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Already this is getting messy, now imagine another entry in the
    hash, an array of children's names. This would require</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  if (ref($hash) eq &quot;HASH&quot;)
  {
    like($hash-&gt;{Name}, $name_pat, &quot;name ok&quot;);
    like($hash-&gt;{Phone}, '/^0d{6}$/', &quot;phone ok&quot;);
    my $cn = $hash-&gt;{ChildNames};
    if (ref($cn) eq &quot;ARRAY&quot;)
    {
      foreach my $child (@$cn)
      {
        like($child, $name_pat);
      }
    }
    else
    {
        fail(&quot;child names not an array&quot;)
    }
  }
  else
  {
    fail(&quot;person not a hash&quot;);
  }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This is a horrible mess and because we don't know in advance how
    many children's names there will be, we can't make a plan for our test
    anymore (actually, we could but it would make things even more
  complicated).</p>
<p class="Pp">Test::Deep to the rescue.</p>

    },
    &quot;person ok&quot;

</pre>
<p class="Pp">This will do everything that the messy code above does and it will
    give a sensible message telling you exactly what went wrong if it finds a
    part of <span class="Li">$person</span> that doesn't match the pattern.
    <span class="Li">&quot;re()&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;array_each()&quot;</span> are special function
    imported from Test::Deep. They create a marker that tells Test::Deep that
    something different is happening here. Instead of just doing a simple
    comparison and checking are two things exactly equal, it should do something
    else.</p>
<p class="Pp">If a person was asked to check that 2 structures are equal, they
    could print them both out and compare them line by line. The markers above
    are similar to writing a note in red pen on one of the printouts telling the
    person that for this piece of the structure, they should stop doing simple
    line by line comparison and do something else.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;re($regex)&quot;</span> means that
    Test::Deep should check that the current piece of data matches the regex in
    <span class="Li">$regex</span>.
    <span class="Li">&quot;array_each($struct)&quot;</span> means that
    Test::Deep should expect the current piece of data to be an array and it
    should check that every element of that array matches
    <span class="Li">$struct</span>. In this case, every element of
    <span class="Li">&quot;$person-&gt;{ChildNames}&quot;</span> should look
    like a name. If say the 3rd one didn't you would get an error message

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Reusing_structures"><a class="permalink" href="#Reusing_structures">Reusing
  structures</a></h2>
Test::Deep is good for reusing test structures so you can do this
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  my $name_re = re('^(Mr|Mrs|Miss) \w+ \w+$');
  my $person_cmp = {
    Name =&gt; $name_re,
    Phone =&gt; re('^0d{6}$'),
    ChildNames =&gt; array_each($name_re)
  };

  cmp_deeply($person1, $person_cmp, &quot;person ok&quot;);
  cmp_deeply($person2, $person_cmp, &quot;person ok&quot;);
  cmp_deeply($person3, $person_cmp, &quot;person ok&quot;);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">You can even put <span class="Li">$person_cmp</span> in a module
    and let other people use it when they are writing test scripts for modules
    that use your modules.</p>
<p class="Pp">To make things a little more difficult, lets change the person
    data structure so that instead of a list of ChildNames, it contains a list
    of hashes, one for each child. So in fact our person structure will contain
    other person structures which may contain other person structures and so on.
    This is easy to handle with Test::Deep because Test::Deep structures can
    include themselves. Simply do</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  my $name_re = re('^(Mr|Mrs|Miss) \w+ \w+$');
  my $person_cmp = {
    Name =&gt; $name_re,
    Phone =&gt; re('^0d{6}$'),
    # note no mention of Children here
  };

  $person_cmp-&gt;{Children} = array_each($person_cmp);

  cmp_deeply($person, $person_cmp, &quot;person ok&quot;);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This will now check that
    <span class="Li">$person</span>-&gt;{Children} is an array and that every
    element of that array also matches <span class="Li">$person_cmp</span>, this
    includes checking that it's children also match the same pattern and so
  on.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Circular_data_structures"><a class="permalink" href="#Circular_data_structures">Circular
  data structures</a></h2>
A circular data structure is one which loops back on itself, you can make one
  easily by doing
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  my @b;
  my @a = (1, 2, 3, \@b);
  push(@b, \@a);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">now <span class="Li">@a</span> contains a reference to be
    <span class="Li">@b</span> and <span class="Li">@b</span> contains a
    reference to <span class="Li">@a</span>. This causes problems if you have a
    program that wants to look inside <span class="Li">@a</span> and keep
    looking deeper and deeper at every level, it could get caught in an infinite
    loop looking into <span class="Li">@a</span> then <span class="Li">@b</span>
    then <span class="Li">@a</span> then <span class="Li">@b</span> and so
  on.</p>
<p class="Pp">Test::Deep avoids this problem so we can extend our example
    further by saying that a person should also list their parents.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  my $name_re = re('^(Mr|Mrs|Miss) \w+ \w+$');
  my $person_cmp = {
    Name =&gt; $name_re,
    Phone =&gt; re('^0d{6}$'),
    # note no mention of Children here
  };

  $person_cmp-&gt;{Children} = each_array($person_cmp);
  $person_cmp-&gt;{Parents} = each_array($person_cmp);

  cmp_deeply($person, $person_cmp, &quot;person ok&quot;);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">So this will check that for each child
    <span class="Li">$child</span> in
    <span class="Li">&quot;$person-&gt;{Children}&quot;</span> that the
    <span class="Li">&quot;$child-&gt;{Parents}&quot;</span> matches
    <span class="Li">$person_cmp</span> however it is smart enough not to get
    caught in an infinite loop where it keeps bouncing between the same Parent
    and Child.</p>

<span class="Li">&quot;cmp_deeply($got, $expected, $name)&quot;</span> takes 3
  arguments. <span class="Li">$got</span> is the structure that you are
  checking, you must not include any special comparisons in this structure or

  Test::Deep will be looking for in <span class="Li">$got</span>. You can put
  special comparisons in <span class="Li">$expected</span> if you want to.
<p class="Pp">As Test::Deep descends through the 2 structures, it compares them
    one piece at a time, so at any point in the process, Test::Deep is thinking
    about 2 things - the current value from <span class="Li">$got</span> and the
    current value from <span class="Li">$expected</span>. In the documentation,
    I call them <span class="Li">$got_v</span> and

You've written a module to handle people and their film interests. Say you have

  with 2 keys: Name and Age and the array is sorted by Name. You can do

<pre>

</pre>
<p class="Pp">Soon after, your query function changes and all the results now
    have an ID field. Now your test is failing again because you left out ID
    from each of the hashes. The problem is that the IDs are generated by the
    database and you have no way of knowing what each person's ID is. With
    Test::Deep you can change your query to</p>

    you no longer know what order the people will appear in. You could add a

  ARE SPECIAL COMPARISONS?</a></h1>
A special comparison (SC) is simply an object that inherits from
  Test::Deep::Cmp. Whenever <span class="Li">$expected_v</span> is an SC then
  instead of checking <span class="Li">&quot;$got_v eq $expected_v&quot;</span>,
  we pass control over to the SC and let it do it's thing.
<p class="Pp">Test::Deep exports lots of SC constructors, to make it easy for
    you to use them in your test scripts. For example is
    <span class="Li">&quot;re(&quot;hello&quot;)&quot;</span> is just a handy
    way of creating a Test::Deep::Regexp object that will match any string
    containing &quot;hello&quot;. So</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  cmp_deeply([ 'a', 'b', 'hello world'], ['a', 'b', re(&quot;^hello&quot;)]);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">will check <span class="Li">'a' eq 'a'</span>,
    <span class="Li">'b' eq 'b'</span> but when it comes to comparing
    <span class="Li">'hello world'</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;re(&quot;^hello&quot;)&quot;</span> it will see that
    <span class="Li">$expected_v</span> is an SC and so will pass control to the
    Test::Deep::Regexp class by do something like
    <span class="Li">&quot;$expected_v-&gt;descend($got_v)&quot;</span>. The
    <span class="Li">&quot;descend()&quot;</span> method should just return true
    or false.</p>
<p class="Pp">This gives you enough to write your own SCs but I haven't
    documented how diagnostics works because it's about to get an overhaul.</p>
