<h2 class="Ss" id="Interpreter_cloning,_threads,_and_concurrency"><a class="permalink" href="#Interpreter_cloning,_threads,_and_concurrency">Interpreter
  cloning, threads, and concurrency</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Perl 5.6.0 introduces the beginnings of support for running
    multiple interpreters concurrently in different threads. In conjunction with
    the <b>perl_clone()</b> API call, which can be used to selectively duplicate
    the state of any given interpreter, it is possible to compile a piece of
    code once in an interpreter, clone that interpreter one or more times, and
    run all the resulting interpreters in distinct threads.</p>
<p class="Pp">On the Windows platform, this feature is used to emulate
    <b>fork()</b> at the interpreter level. See perlfork for details about
  that.</p>
<p class="Pp">This feature is still in evolution. It is eventually meant to be
    used to selectively clone a subroutine and data reachable from that
    subroutine in a separate interpreter and run the cloned subroutine in a
    separate thread. Since there is no shared data between the interpreters,
    little or no locking will be needed (unless parts of the symbol table are
    explicitly shared). This is obviously intended to be an easy-to-use
    replacement for the existing threads support.</p>
<p class="Pp">Support for cloning interpreters and interpreter concurrency can
    be enabled using the -Dusethreads Configure option (see win32/Makefile for
    how to enable it on Windows.) The resulting perl executable will be
    functionally identical to one that was built with -Dmultiplicity, but the
    <b>perl_clone()</b> API call will only be available in the former.</p>
<p class="Pp">-Dusethreads enables the cpp macro USE_ITHREADS by default, which
    in turn enables Perl source code changes that provide a clear separation
    between the op tree and the data it operates with. The former is immutable,
    and can therefore be shared between an interpreter and all of its clones,
    while the latter is considered local to each interpreter, and is therefore
    copied for each clone.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that building Perl with the -Dusemultiplicity Configure
    option is adequate if you wish to run multiple <b>independent</b>
    interpreters concurrently in different threads. -Dusethreads only provides
    the additional functionality of the <b>perl_clone()</b> API call and other
    support for running <b>cloned</b> interpreters concurrently.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    NOTE: This is an experimental feature.  Implementation details are
    subject to change.

<h2 class="Ss" id="Lexically_scoped_warning_categories"><a class="permalink" href="#Lexically_scoped_warning_categories">Lexically
  scoped warning categories</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">You can now control the granularity of warnings emitted by perl at
    a finer level using the <span class="Li">&quot;use warnings&quot;</span>
    pragma. warnings and perllexwarn have copious documentation on this
  feature.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Unicode_and_"><a class="permalink" href="#Unicode_and_">Unicode
  and UTF-8 support</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Perl now uses UTF-8 as its internal representation for character
    strings. The <span class="Li">&quot;utf8&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;bytes&quot;</span> pragmas are used to control this
    support in the current lexical scope. See perlunicode, utf8 and bytes for
    more information.</p>
<p class="Pp">This feature is expected to evolve quickly to support some form of
    I/O disciplines that can be used to specify the kind of input and output
    data (bytes or characters). Until that happens, additional modules from CPAN
    will be needed to complete the toolkit for dealing with Unicode.</p>

    details are subject to change.

<h2 class="Ss" id="Support_for_interpolating_named_characters"><a class="permalink" href="#Support_for_interpolating_named_characters">Support
  for interpolating named characters</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The new <span class="Li">&quot;\N&quot;</span> escape interpolates
    named characters within strings. For example, <span class="Li">&quot;Hi!
    \N{WHITE SMILING FACE}&quot;</span> evaluates to a string with a unicode

<h2 class="Ss" id="_our__declarations"><a class="permalink" href="#_our__declarations">&quot;our&quot;
  declarations</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">An &quot;our&quot; declaration introduces a value that can be best
    understood as a lexically scoped symbolic alias to a global variable in the
    package that was current where the variable was declared. This is mostly
    useful as an alternative to the <span class="Li">&quot;vars&quot;</span>
    pragma, but also provides the opportunity to introduce typing and other
    attributes for such variables. See &quot;our&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Support_for_strings_represented_as_a_vector_of_ordinals"><a class="permalink" href="#Support_for_strings_represented_as_a_vector_of_ordinals">Support
  for strings represented as a vector of ordinals</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Literals of the form <span class="Li">&quot;v1.2.3.4&quot;</span>
    are now parsed as a string composed of characters with the specified
    ordinals. This is an alternative, more readable way to construct (possibly
    unicode) strings instead of interpolating characters, as in
    <span class="Li">&quot;\x{1}\x{2}\x{3}\x{4}&quot;</span>. The leading
    <span class="Li">&quot;v&quot;</span> may be omitted if there are more than
    two ordinals, so <span class="Li">1.2.3</span> is parsed the same as
    <span class="Li">&quot;v1.2.3&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Strings written in this form are also useful to represent version
    &quot;numbers&quot;. It is easy to compare such version &quot;numbers&quot;
    (which are really just plain strings) using any of the usual string
    comparison operators <span class="Li">&quot;eq&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;ne&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;lt&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;gt&quot;</span>, etc., or perform bitwise string
    operations on them using <span class="Li">&quot;|&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;&amp;&quot;</span>, etc.</p>
<p class="Pp">In conjunction with the new <span class="Li">$^V</span> magic
    variable (which contains the perl version as a string), such literals can be
    used as a readable way to check if you're running a particular version of
    Perl:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    # this will parse in older versions of Perl also
    if ($^V and $^V gt v5.6.0) {
        # new features supported
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;require&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;use&quot;</span> also have some special magic to
    support such literals, but this particular usage should be avoided because
    it leads to misleading error messages under versions of Perl which don't
    support vector strings. Using a true version number will ensure correct
    behavior in all versions of Perl:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    require 5.006;    # run time check for v5.6
    use 5.006_001;    # compile time check for v5.6.1
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Also, <span class="Li">&quot;sprintf&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;printf&quot;</span> support the Perl-specific format
    flag <span class="Li">%v</span> to print ordinals of characters in arbitrary
    strings:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    printf &quot;v%vd&quot;, $^V;         # prints current version, such as &quot;v5.5.650&quot;
    printf &quot;%*vX&quot;, &quot;:&quot;, $addr;  # formats IPv6 address
    printf &quot;%*vb&quot;, &quot; &quot;, $bits;  # displays bitstring

<h2 class="Ss" id="Improved_Perl_version_numbering_system"><a class="permalink" href="#Improved_Perl_version_numbering_system">Improved
  Perl version numbering system</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Beginning with Perl version 5.6.0, the version number convention
    has been changed to a &quot;dotted integer&quot; scheme that is more
    commonly found in open source projects.</p>
<p class="Pp">Maintenance versions of v5.6.0 will be released as v5.6.1, v5.6.2
    etc. The next development series following v5.6.0 will be numbered v5.7.x,
    beginning with v5.7.0, and the next major production release following
    v5.6.0 will be v5.8.0.</p>
<p class="Pp">The English module now sets <span class="Li">$PERL_VERSION</span>
    to $^V (a string value) rather than <span class="Li">$]</span> (a numeric
    value). (This is a potential incompatibility. Send us a report via perlbug
    if you are affected by this.)</p>
<p class="Pp">The v1.2.3 syntax is also now legal in Perl. See &quot;Support for
    strings represented as a vector of ordinals&quot; for more on that.</p>
<p class="Pp">To cope with the new versioning system's use of at least three
    significant digits for each version component, the method used for
    incrementing the subversion number has also changed slightly. We assume that
    versions older than v5.6.0 have been incrementing the subversion component
    in multiples of 10. Versions after v5.6.0 will increment them by 1. Thus,
    using the new notation, 5.005_03 is the &quot;same&quot; as v5.5.30, and the
    first maintenance version following v5.6.0 will be v5.6.1 (which should be
    read as being equivalent to a floating point value of 5.006_001 in the older
    format, stored in <span class="Li">$]</span>).</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="New_syntax_for_declaring_subroutine_attributes"><a class="permalink" href="#New_syntax_for_declaring_subroutine_attributes">New
  syntax for declaring subroutine attributes</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Formerly, if you wanted to mark a subroutine as being a method
    call or as requiring an automatic <b>lock()</b> when it is entered, you had
    to declare that with a <span class="Li">&quot;use attrs&quot;</span> pragma
    in the body of the subroutine. That can now be accomplished with declaration
    syntax, like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    sub mymethod : locked method;
    ...
    sub mymethod : locked method {
        ...
    }
    sub othermethod :locked :method;
    ...
    sub othermethod :locked :method {
        ...
    }

<p class="Pp">(Note how only the first <span class="Li">&quot;:&quot;</span> is
    mandatory, and whitespace surrounding the
    <span class="Li">&quot;:&quot;</span> is optional.)</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>AutoSplit.pm</i> and <i>SelfLoader.pm</i> have been updated to

  and directory handles can be autovivified</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Similar to how constructs such as
    <span class="Li">&quot;$x-&gt;[0]&quot;</span> autovivify a reference,
    handle constructors (<b>open()</b>, <b>opendir()</b>, <b>pipe()</b>,
    <b>socketpair()</b>, <b>sysopen()</b>, <b>socket()</b>, and <b>accept()</b>)
    now autovivify a file or directory handle if the handle passed to them is an
    uninitialized scalar variable. This allows the constructs such as
    <span class="Li">&quot;open(my $fh, ...)&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;open(local $fh,...)&quot;</span> to be used to create
    filehandles that will conveniently be closed automatically when the scope
    ends, provided there are no other references to them. This largely
    eliminates the need for typeglobs when opening filehandles that must be
    passed around, as in the following example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    sub myopen {
        open my $fh, &quot;@_&quot;
             or die &quot;Can't open '@_': $!&quot;;
        return $fh;
    }
    {
        my $f = myopen(&quot;&lt;/etc/motd&quot;);
        print &lt;$f&gt;;
        # $f implicitly closed here
    }

<h2 class="Ss"><b>open()</b> with more than two arguments</h2>
<p class="Pp">If <b>open()</b> is passed three arguments instead of two, the

    magic behavior of the traditional two-argument form. See &quot;open&quot; in

<h2 class="Ss" id="64"><a class="permalink" href="#64">64-bit support</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Any platform that has 64-bit integers either</p>

        (2) via special compiler flags
        (3) using long long or int64_t
</pre>
<p class="Pp">is able to use &quot;quads&quot; (64-bit integers) as follows:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>constants (decimal, hexadecimal, octal, binary) in the code</li>
  <li>arguments to <b>oct()</b> and <b>hex()</b></li>
  <li>arguments to <b>print()</b>, <b>printf()</b> and <b>sprintf()</b> (flag
      prefixes ll, L, q)</li>
  <li>printed as such</li>
  <li><b>pack()</b> and <b>unpack()</b> &quot;q&quot; and &quot;Q&quot;
    formats</li>
  <li>in basic arithmetics: + - * / % (NOTE: operating close to the limits of
      the integer values may produce surprising results)</li>
  <li>in bit arithmetics: &amp; | ^ ~ &lt;&lt; &gt;&gt; (NOTE: these used to be
      forced to be 32 bits wide but now operate on the full native width.)</li>
  <li><b>vec()</b></li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">Note that unless you have the case (a) you will have to configure
    and compile Perl using the -Duse64bitint Configure flag.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    NOTE: The Configure flags -Duselonglong and -Duse64bits have been
    deprecated.  Use -Duse64bitint instead.
</pre>
<p class="Pp">There are actually two modes of 64-bitness: the first one is
    achieved using Configure -Duse64bitint and the second one using Configure
    -Duse64bitall. The difference is that the first one is minimal and the
    second one maximal. The first works in more places than the second.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;use64bitint&quot;</span> does only as
    much as is required to get 64-bit integers into Perl (this may mean, for
    example, using &quot;long longs&quot;) while your memory may still be
    limited to 2 gigabytes (because your pointers could still be 32-bit). Note
    that the name <span class="Li">&quot;64bitint&quot;</span> does not imply
    that your C compiler will be using 64-bit
    <span class="Li">&quot;int&quot;</span>s (it might, but it doesn't have to):
    the <span class="Li">&quot;use64bitint&quot;</span> means that you will be
    able to have 64 bits wide scalar values.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;use64bitall&quot;</span> goes all the
    way by attempting to switch also integers (if it can), longs (and pointers)
    to being 64-bit. This may create an even more binary incompatible Perl than
    -Duse64bitint: the resulting executable may not run at all in a 32-bit box,
    or you may have to reboot/reconfigure/rebuild your operating system to be
    64-bit aware.</p>
<p class="Pp">Natively 64-bit systems like Alpha and Cray need neither
    -Duse64bitint nor -Duse64bitall.</p>
<p class="Pp">Last but not least: note that due to Perl's habit of always using
    floating point numbers, the quads are still not true integers. When quads
    overflow their limits (0...18_446_744_073_709_551_615 unsigned,
    -9_223_372_036_854_775_808...9_223_372_036_854_775_807 signed), they are
    silently promoted to floating point numbers, after which they will start
    losing precision (in their lower digits).</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    NOTE: 64-bit support is still experimental on most platforms.
    Existing support only covers the LP64 data model.  In particular, the
    LLP64 data model is not yet supported.  64-bit libraries and system
    APIs on many platforms have not stabilized--your mileage may vary.

<h2 class="Ss" id="Large_file_support"><a class="permalink" href="#Large_file_support">Large
  file support</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">If you have filesystems that support &quot;large files&quot;
    (files larger than 2 gigabytes), you may now also be able to create and
    access them from Perl.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    NOTE: The default action is to enable large file support, if
    available on the platform.
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If the large file support is on, and you have a Fcntl constant
    O_LARGEFILE, the O_LARGEFILE is automatically added to the flags of
    <b>sysopen()</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Beware that unless your filesystem also supports &quot;sparse
    files&quot; seeking to umpteen petabytes may be inadvisable.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that in addition to requiring a proper file system to do
    large files you may also need to adjust your per-process (or your
    per-system, or per-process-group, or per-user-group) maximum filesize limits
    before running Perl scripts that try to handle large files, especially if
    you intend to write such files.</p>
<p class="Pp">Finally, in addition to your process/process group maximum
    filesize limits, you may have quota limits on your filesystems that stop you
    (your user id or your user group id) from using large files.</p>
<p class="Pp">Adjusting your process/user/group/file system/operating system
    limits is outside the scope of Perl core language. For process limits, you
    may try increasing the limits using your shell's limits/limit/ulimit command
    before running Perl. The BSD::Resource extension (not included with the
    standard Perl distribution) may also be of use, it offers the
    getrlimit/setrlimit interface that can be used to adjust process resource

<h2 class="Ss" id="Weak_references"><a class="permalink" href="#Weak_references">Weak
  references</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">In previous versions of Perl, you couldn't cache objects so as to
    allow them to be deleted if the last reference from outside the cache is
    deleted. The reference in the cache would hold a reference count on the
    object and the objects would never be destroyed.</p>
<p class="Pp">Another familiar problem is with circular references. When an
    object references itself, its reference count would never go down to zero,
    and it would not get destroyed until the program is about to exit.</p>
<p class="Pp">Weak references solve this by allowing you to &quot;weaken&quot;
    any reference, that is, make it not count towards the reference count. When
    the last non-weak reference to an object is deleted, the object is destroyed
    and all the weak references to the object are automatically undef-ed.</p>
<p class="Pp">To use this feature, you need the Devel::WeakRef package from
    CPAN, which contains additional documentation.</p>

<p class="Pp"><b>delete()</b> may be used to remove an element from the array
    and return it. The array element at that position returns to its

    <b>exists()</b> will return false. If the element happens to be the one at
    the end, the size of the array also shrinks up to the highest element that
    tests true for <b>exists()</b>, or 0 if none such is found. If the array is

  <dd>The Perl Compiler suite has been extensively reworked for this release.
      More of the standard Perl test suite passes when run under the Compiler,
      but there is still a significant way to go to achieve production quality
      compiled executables.
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    NOTE: The Compiler suite remains highly experimental.  The
    generated code may not be correct, even when it manages to execute
    without errors.

  <dt id="Benchmark"><a class="permalink" href="#Benchmark">Benchmark</a></dt>
  <dd>Overall, Benchmark results exhibit lower average error and better timing
      accuracy.
    <p class="Pp">You can now run tests for <i>n</i> seconds instead of guessing
        the right number of tests to run: e.g., timethese(-5, ...) will run each
        code for at least 5 CPU seconds. Zero as the &quot;number of
        repetitions&quot; means &quot;for at least 3 CPU seconds&quot;. The
        output format has also changed. For example:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>   use Benchmark;$x=3;timethese(-5,{a=&gt;sub{$x*$x},b=&gt;sub{$x**2}})
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">will now output something like this:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>   Benchmark: running a, b, each for at least 5 CPU seconds...
            a:  5 wallclock secs ( 5.77 usr +  0.00 sys =  5.77 CPU) @ 200551.91/s (n=1156516)
            b:  4 wallclock secs ( 5.00 usr +  0.02 sys =  5.02 CPU) @ 159605.18/s (n=800686)
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">New features: &quot;each for at least N CPU seconds...&quot;,
        &quot;wallclock secs&quot;, and the &quot;@ operations/CPU second
        (n=operations)&quot;.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><b>timethese()</b> now returns a reference to a hash of
        Benchmark objects containing the test results, keyed on the names of the
        tests.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><b>timethis()</b> now returns the iterations field in the
        Benchmark result object instead of 0.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><b>timethese()</b>, <b>timethis()</b>, and the new
        <b>cmpthese()</b> (see below) can also take a format specifier of 'none'
        to suppress output.</p>
    <p class="Pp">A new function <b>countit()</b> is just like <b>timeit()</b>
        except that it takes a TIME instead of a COUNT.</p>
    <p class="Pp">A new function <b>cmpthese()</b> prints a chart comparing the
        results of each test returned from a <b>timethese()</b> call. For each
        possible pair of tests, the percentage speed difference (iters/sec or
        seconds/iter) is shown.</p>

<h2 class="Ss">-Dusethreads means something different</h2>
<p class="Pp">The -Dusethreads flag now enables the experimental
    interpreter-based thread support by default. To get the flavor of
    experimental threads that was in 5.005 instead, you need to run Configure
    with &quot;-Dusethreads -Duse5005threads&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">As of v5.6.0, interpreter-threads support is still lacking a way

    <span class="Li">&quot;use Thread;&quot;</span> continues to be available

    64-bitness are now more daring in the sense that they no more have an
    explicit list of operating systems of known threads/64-bit capabilities. In
    other words: if your operating system has the necessary APIs and datatypes,
    you should be able just to go ahead and use them, for threads by Configure
    -Dusethreads, and for 64 bits either explicitly by Configure -Duse64bitint

<p class="Pp">The installation structure has been enriched to improve the
    support for maintaining multiple versions of perl, to provide locations for
    vendor-supplied modules, scripts, and manpages, and to ease maintenance of
    locally-added modules, scripts, and manpages. See the section on
    Installation Directories in the INSTALL file for complete details. For most
    users building and installing from source, the defaults should be fine.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you previously used <span class="Li">&quot;Configure
    -Dsitelib&quot;</span> or <span class="Li">&quot;-Dsitearch&quot;</span> to
    set special values for library directories, you might wish to consider using
    the new <span class="Li">&quot;-Dsiteprefix&quot;</span> setting instead.
    Also, if you wish to re-use a config.sh file from an earlier version of

    the new directories. See INSTALL for complete details.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Win32~2"><a class="permalink" href="#Win32~2">Win32</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Perl can now emulate <b>fork()</b> internally, using multiple

<p class="Pp">When given a pathname that consists only of a drivename, such as

<p class="Pp"><b>POSIX::uname()</b> is supported.</p>
<p class="Pp">system(1,...) now returns true process IDs rather than process

<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;Shell&quot;</span> module is
  supported.</p>
<p class="Pp">Better support for building Perl under command.com in Windows 95
    has been added.</p>
<p class="Pp">Scripts are read in binary mode by default to allow ByteLoader
    (and the filter mechanism in general) to work properly. For compatibility,
    the DATA filehandle will be set to text mode if a carriage return is
    detected at the end of the line containing the __END__ or __DATA__ token; if
    not, the DATA filehandle will be left open in binary mode. Earlier versions
    always opened the DATA filehandle in text mode.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>glob()</b> operator is implemented via the
    <span class="Li">&quot;File::Glob&quot;</span> extension, which supports
    glob syntax of the C shell. This increases the flexibility of the
    <b>glob()</b> operator, but there may be compatibility issues for programs
    that relied on the older globbing syntax. If you want to preserve
    compatibility with the older syntax, you might want to run perl with
    <span class="Li">&quot;-MFile::DosGlob&quot;</span>. For details and
    compatibility information, see File::Glob.</p>

<p class="Pp">Some &quot;errors&quot; encountered at compile time were by

    rather than causing a hard stop at the first error that was encountered.</p>
<p class="Pp">The mechanism for reporting such errors has been reimplemented to
    queue compile-time errors and report them at the end of the compilation as
    true errors rather than as warnings. This fixes cases where error messages
    leaked through in the form of warnings when code was compiled at run time
    using <span class="Li">&quot;eval STRING&quot;</span>, and also allows such

<h2 class="Ss" id="Behavior_of_list_slices_is_more_consistent"><a class="permalink" href="#Behavior_of_list_slices_is_more_consistent">Behavior
  of list slices is more consistent</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">When taking a slice of a literal list (as opposed to a slice of an
    array or hash), Perl used to return an empty list if the result happened to
    be composed of all undef values.</p>
<p class="Pp">The new behavior is to produce an empty list if (and only if) the
    original list was empty. Consider the following example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    @a = (1,undef,undef,2)[2,1,2];
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The old behavior would have resulted in <span class="Li">@a</span>
    having no elements. The new behavior ensures it has three undefined
    elements.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note in particular that the behavior of slices of the following
    cases remains unchanged:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    @a = ()[1,2];
    @a = (getpwent)[7,0];
    @a = (anything_returning_empty_list())[2,1,2];
    @a = @b[2,1,2];
    @a = @c{'a','b','c'};

<p class="Pp">When code in a destructor threw an exception, it went unnoticed in

<p class="Pp">Numbers formatted according to the local numeric locale (such as
    using a decimal comma instead of a decimal dot) caused &quot;isn't

  <dt>/ cannot take a count</dt>
  <dd>(F) You had an unpack template indicating a counted-length string, but you
      have also specified an explicit size for the string. See &quot;pack&quot;
      in perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt>/ must be followed by a, A or Z</dt>
  <dd>(F) You had an unpack template indicating a counted-length string, which

      string is to be unpacked. See &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt>/ must be followed by a*, A* or Z*</dt>
  <dd>(F) You had a pack template indicating a counted-length string, Currently

  <dt>/ must follow a numeric type</dt>
  <dd>(F) You had an unpack template that contained a '#', but this did not
      follow some numeric unpack specification. See &quot;pack&quot; in
      perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt>/%s/: Unrecognized escape \\%c passed through</dt>
  <dd>(W regexp) You used a backslash-character combination which is not
      recognized by Perl. This combination appears in an interpolated variable
      or a <span class="Li">&quot;'&quot;</span>-delimited regular expression.
      The character was understood literally.</dd>
  <dt>/%s/: Unrecognized escape \\%c in character class passed through</dt>
  <dd>(W regexp) You used a backslash-character combination which is not
      recognized by Perl inside character classes. The character was understood
      literally.</dd>
  <dt>/%s/ should probably be written as &quot;%s&quot;</dt>
  <dd>(W syntax) You have used a pattern where Perl expected to find a string,
      as in the first argument to <span class="Li">&quot;join&quot;</span>. Perl
      will treat the true or false result of matching the pattern against
      <span class="Li">$_</span> as the string, which is probably not what you
      had in mind.</dd>
  <dt>%s() called too early to check prototype</dt>
  <dd>(W prototype) You've called a function that has a prototype before the
      parser saw a definition or declaration for it, and Perl could not check
      that the call conforms to the prototype. You need to either add an early
      prototype declaration for the subroutine in question, or move the
      subroutine definition ahead of the call to get proper prototype checking.
      Alternatively, if you are certain that you're calling the function
      correctly, you may put an ampersand before the name to avoid the warning.
      See perlsub.</dd>
  <dt>%s argument is not a HASH or ARRAY element</dt>
  <dd>(F) The argument to <b>exists()</b> must be a hash or array element, such
      as:

    <pre>    $foo{$bar}
    $ref-&gt;{&quot;susie&quot;}[12]
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>%s argument is not a HASH or ARRAY element or slice</dt>
  <dd>(F) The argument to <b>delete()</b> must be either a hash or array
      element, such as:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    $foo{$bar}
    $ref-&gt;{&quot;susie&quot;}[12]
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">or a hash or array slice, such as:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    @foo[$bar, $baz, $xyzzy]
    @{$ref-&gt;[12]}{&quot;susie&quot;, &quot;queue&quot;}

  </dd>
  <dt>%s argument is not a subroutine name</dt>
  <dd>(F) The argument to <b>exists()</b> for <span class="Li">&quot;exists
      &amp;sub&quot;</span> must be a subroutine name, and not a subroutine
      call. <span class="Li">&quot;exists &amp;sub()&quot;</span> will generate
      this error.</dd>
  <dt>%s package attribute may clash with future reserved word: %s</dt>
  <dd>(W reserved) A lowercase attribute name was used that had a
      package-specific handler. That name might have a meaning to Perl itself
      some day, even though it doesn't yet. Perhaps you should use a mixed-case
      attribute name, instead. See attributes.</dd>
  <dt>(in cleanup) %s</dt>
  <dd>(W misc) This prefix usually indicates that a <b>DESTROY()</b> method
      raised the indicated exception. Since destructors are usually called by
      the system at arbitrary points during execution, and often a vast number
      of times, the warning is issued only once for any number of failures that
      would otherwise result in the same message being repeated.
    <p class="Pp">Failure of user callbacks dispatched using the
        <span class="Li">&quot;G_KEEPERR&quot;</span> flag could also result in

  <dt id="Bareword"><a class="permalink" href="#Bareword">Bareword found in

  <dd>(W bareword) The compiler found a bareword where it expected a
      conditional, which often indicates that an || or &amp;&amp; was parsed as
      part of the last argument of the previous construct, for example:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    open FOO || die;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">It may also indicate a misspelled constant that has been

  <dt>&quot;PERL_POLLUTE&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Release 5.005 grandfathered old global symbol names by providing
      preprocessor macros for extension source compatibility. As of release
      5.6.0, these preprocessor definitions are not available by default. You
      need to explicitly compile perl with
      <span class="Li">&quot;-DPERL_POLLUTE&quot;</span> to get these
      definitions. For extensions still using the old symbols, this option can
      be specified via MakeMaker:

    <pre>    perl Makefile.PL POLLUTE=1

  <dt>&quot;PERL_IMPLICIT_CONTEXT&quot;</dt>
  <dd>This new build option provides a set of macros for all API functions such
      that an implicit interpreter/thread context argument is passed to every
      API function. As a result of this, something like
      <span class="Li">&quot;sv_setsv(foo,bar)&quot;</span> amounts to a macro
      invocation that actually translates to something like
      <span class="Li">&quot;Perl_sv_setsv(my_perl,foo,bar)&quot;</span>. While
      this is generally expected to not have any significant source
      compatibility issues, the difference between a macro and a real function
      call will need to be considered.
    <p class="Pp">This means that there <b>is</b> a source compatibility issue
        as a result of this if your extensions attempt to use pointers to any of
        the Perl API functions.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that the above issue is not relevant to the default build
        of Perl, whose interfaces continue to match those of prior versions (but
        subject to the other options described here).</p>
    <p class="Pp">See &quot;Background and PERL_IMPLICIT_CONTEXT&quot; in

  <dt>&quot;PERL_POLLUTE_MALLOC&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Enabling Perl's malloc in release 5.005 and earlier caused the namespace
      of the system's malloc family of functions to be usurped by the Perl
      versions, since by default they used the same names. Besides causing
      problems on platforms that do not allow these functions to be cleanly
      replaced, this also meant that the system versions could not be called in
      programs that used Perl's malloc. Previous versions of Perl have allowed
      this behaviour to be suppressed with the HIDEMYMALLOC and EMBEDMYMALLOC
      preprocessor definitions.
    <p class="Pp">As of release 5.6.0, Perl's malloc family of functions have
        default names distinct from the system versions. You need to explicitly
        compile perl with
        <span class="Li">&quot;-DPERL_POLLUTE_MALLOC&quot;</span> to get the
        older behaviour. HIDEMYMALLOC and EMBEDMYMALLOC have no effect, since
        the behaviour they enabled is now the default.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that these functions do <b>not</b> constitute Perl's
        memory allocation API. See &quot;Memory Allocation&quot; in perlguts for
        further information about that.</p>

<p class="Pp">On platforms that require an explicit list of exports (AIX, OS/2

    <p class="Pp">However, the developers of Perl 5.004 could not fix this bug
        completely, because at least two widely-used modules depend on the old

        &quot;$$&lt;digit&gt;&quot; in the old (broken) way inside strings; but
        it generates this message as a warning. And in Perl 5.005, this special
