<p class="Pp">Test::Trap neither traps nor tests everything you may want to trap
    or test. So, Test::Trap::Builder provides methods to write your own trap
    layers, accessors, and test callbacks -- preferably for use with your own
    modules (trappers).</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that layers are methods with mangled names (names are
    prefixed with <span class="Li">&quot;layer:&quot;</span>), and so inherited
    like any other method, while accessors are ordinary methods. Meanwhile, test
    callbacks are not referenced in the symbol table by themselves, but only in
    combinations with accessors, all methods of the form
    <i>ACCESSOR</i>_<i>TEST</i>.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="EXPORTS"><a class="permalink" href="#EXPORTS">EXPORTS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Trappers should not inherit from Test::Trap::Builder, but may
    import a few convenience methods for use in building the trap. Do not use
    them as methods of Test::Trap::Builder -- they are intended to be methods of
    trap objects. (If you inherit from another trapper, you need not, and
    probably should not, import these yourself -- you should inherit these
    methods like any other.)</p>
<p class="Pp">Trappers may import any number of these methods, or all of them by
    way of the <span class="Li">&quot;:methods&quot;</span> tag.</p>
<p class="Pp">Layers should be implemented as methods, and while they need not
    call any of these convenience methods in turn, that likely makes for more
    readable code than any alternative. Likewise, test callbacks may use
    convenience methods for more readable code.</p>
<p class="Pp">Of course, certain convenience methods may also be useful in more
    generic methods messing with trap or builder objects.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Prop__"><a class="permalink" href="#Prop__">Prop
  [PACKAGE]</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">A method returning a reference to a hash, holding the
    <i>PACKAGE</i>'s (by default the caller's) tag-on properties for the
    (current) trap object. Currently, Test::Trap::Builder defines the following
    properties:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="layers"><a class="permalink" href="#layers">layers</a></dt>
  <dd>While the trap is springing, the queue of layers remaining. Usually set by
      the &quot;trap&quot; method and consumed by the &quot;Next&quot;
    method.</dd>
  <dt id="teardown"><a class="permalink" href="#teardown">teardown</a></dt>
  <dd>While the trap is springing, the queue of teardown actions remaining.
      Usually accumulated through the &quot;Teardown&quot; method and invoked by
      the &quot;trap&quot; method.</dd>
  <dt id="code"><a class="permalink" href="#code">code</a></dt>
  <dd>The user code trapped. Usually set by the &quot;trap&quot; method and
      invoked by the &quot;Run&quot; method.</dd>
  <dt id="exception"><a class="permalink" href="#exception">exception</a></dt>
  <dd>An internal exception. Usually set through the &quot;Exception&quot;
      method and examined by the &quot;trap&quot; method.</dd>
  <dt id="on_test_failure"><a class="permalink" href="#on_test_failure">on_test_failure</a></dt>
  <dd>A callback invoked by the &quot;TestFailure&quot; method. Layers in
      particular may want to set this.</dd>
  <dt id="test_accessor"><a class="permalink" href="#test_accessor">test_accessor</a></dt>
  <dd>The name and (optionally) the index of the accessor, the contents of which
      we're currently testing. Best accessed through the
      &quot;TestAccessor&quot; method, and usually set by the &quot;test&quot;
      and &quot;accessor&quot; methods, but if you are writing your own tests or
      accessors directly, you just might need to set it. Perhaps.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Be nice: Treat another module's tag-on properties as you would
    treat another module's global variables. Don't use them except as
    documented.</p>
<p class="Pp">Example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  # in a layer, setting the callback for TestFailure:
  $self-&gt;Prop('Test::Trap::Builder')-&gt;{on_test_failure} = \&amp;mydiag;
</pre>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">DESTROY</h2>
<p class="Pp">This cleans up the tag-on properties when the trap object is
    destroyed. Don't try to make a trapper that doesn't call this; it will get
    confused.</p>
<p class="Pp">If your trapper needs its own
    <span class="Li">&quot;DESTROY&quot;</span>, make sure it calls this one as
    well:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  sub DESTROY {
    my $self = shift;
    # do your thing
    $self-&gt;Test::Trap::Builder::DESTROY;
    # and more things
  }
</pre>

<section class="Ss">

<p class="Pp">A terminating layer should call this method to run the user code.

<h2 class="Ss" id="Next"><a class="permalink" href="#Next">Next</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Every non-terminating layer should call this method (or an
    equivalent) to progress to the next layer. Should only be called in a

    the Teardown method (see below).</p>

<p class="Pp">If your layer wants to clean up its setup, it may use this method
    to register any number of tear-down actions, to be performed (in reverse
    registration order) once the user code has been executed. Should only be

</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="TestAccessor"><a class="permalink" href="#TestAccessor">TestAccessor</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Returns a string of the form

    where <i>NAME</i> and <i>INDEX</i> are the name of the accessor and the
    index (if any) being tested. Should only be called in the dynamic context of
    test callbacks.</p>
<p class="Pp">This is intended for diagnostics:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>

        $expected, $self-&gt;TestAccessor, dump($got),

<p class="Pp">Runs the <span class="Li">&quot;on_test_failure&quot;</span>
    tag-on property (if any) on the trap object. If you are writing unregistered

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Exception_"><a class="permalink" href="#Exception_">Exception
  STRINGS</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Layer implementations may run into exceptional situations, in
    which they want the entire trap to fail. Unfortunately, another layer may be
    trapping ordinary exceptions, so you need some kind of magic in order to
    throw an untrappable exception. This is one convenient way.</p>
<p class="Pp">Should only be called in a dynamic context in which layers are
    being applied.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note: The Exception method won't work if called from outside of
    the regular control flow, like inside a DESTROY method or signal handler. If
    anything like this happens, CORE::exit will be called with an exit code of
    8.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note: Direct calls to the Exception method within closures may
    cause circular references and so leakage. To avoid this, fetch an
    &quot;ExceptionFunction&quot; and call it from the closure instead.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="ExceptionFunction"><a class="permalink" href="#ExceptionFunction">ExceptionFunction</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">This method returns a function that may be called with the same
    effect as calling the &quot;Exception&quot; method, allowing closures to
    throw exceptions without causing circular references by closing over the
    trap object itself.</p>
<p class="Pp">To illustrate:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  # this will create a circular reference chain:
  # trap object has property collection has teardown closure has trap object
  $self-&gt;Teardown($_) for sub {
    do_stuff() or $self-&gt;Exception(&quot;Stuff didn't work.&quot;);
  };
  # this will break the circular reference chain:
  # teardown closure no longer has trap object
  $Exception = $self-&gt;ExceptionFunction;
  $self-&gt;Teardown($_) for sub {
    do_things() or $Exception-&gt;(&quot;Things didn't work.&quot;);
