<p class="Pp">The <code class="Nm">mount_msdos</code> command attaches the
    MS-DOS filesystem residing on the device <span class="Pa">special</span> to
    the global filesystem namespace at the location indicated by
    <span class="Pa">node</span>. This command is normally executed by
    <a class="Xr">mount(8)</a> at boot time, but can be used by any user to
    mount an MS-DOS file system on any directory that they own (provided, of
    course, that they have appropriate access to the device that contains the
    file system).</p>
<p class="Pp">The options are as follows:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="o"><a class="permalink" href="#o"><code class="Fl">-o</code></a>
    <var class="Ar">options</var></dt>
  <dd>Use the specified mount <var class="Ar">options</var>, as described in
      <a class="Xr">mount(8)</a>.</dd>
  <dt id="u"><a class="permalink" href="#u"><code class="Fl">-u</code></a>
    <var class="Ar">uid</var></dt>
  <dd>Set the owner of the files in the file system to
      <var class="Ar">uid</var>. The default owner is the owner of the directory
      on which the file system is being mounted.</dd>
  <dt id="g"><a class="permalink" href="#g"><code class="Fl">-g</code></a>
    <var class="Ar">gid</var></dt>
  <dd>Set the group of the files in the file system to
      <var class="Ar">gid</var>. The default group is the group of the directory
      on which the file system is being mounted.</dd>
  <dt id="m"><a class="permalink" href="#m"><code class="Fl">-m</code></a>
    <var class="Ar">mask</var></dt>
  <dd>Specify the maximum file permissions for files in the file system. (For
      example, a <var class="Ar">mask</var> of <code class="Li">755</code>
      specifies that, by default, the owner should have read, write, and execute
      permissions for files, but others should only have read and execute
      permissions. See <a class="Xr">chmod(1)</a> for more information about
      octal file modes.) Only the nine low-order bits of
      <var class="Ar">mask</var> are used. The default
      <var class="Ar">mask</var> is taken from the directory on which the file
      system is being mounted.</dd>

<p class="Pp"><span class="Ux">FreeBSD 2.1</span> and earlier versions could not
    handle cluster sizes larger than 16K. Just mounting an MS-DOS file system
    could cause corruption to any mounted file system. Cluster sizes larger than
    16K are unavoidable for file system sizes larger than 1G, and also occur
    when filesystems larger than 1G are shrunk to smaller than 1G using
  FIPS.</p>

    aptly-named <code class="Nm">mount_msdos</code>.</p>
