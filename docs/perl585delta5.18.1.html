   Set up some character translations and predefined strings.  \*(-- will
   give an unbreakable dash, \*(PI will give pi, \*(L" will give a left
   double quote, and \*(R" will give a right double quote.  \*(C+ will
   give a nicer C++.  Capital omega is used to do unbreakable dashes and
   therefore won't be available.  \*(C` and \*(C' expand to `' in nroff,
   nothing in troff, for use with C<>.

Perl's regular expression engine now contains support for matching on the
  intersection of two Unicode character classes. You can also now refer to
  user-defined character classes from within other user defined character
  classes.

<i>h2ph</i> is now able to understand a very limited set of C inline functions
  -- basically, the inline functions that look like CPP macros. This has been
  introduced to deal with some of the headers of the newest versions of the
  glibc. The standard warning still applies; to quote <i>h2ph</i>'s
  documentation, <i>you may need to dicker with the files produced</i>.

  Bug Fixes</a></h1>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>The in-place sort optimisation introduced in 5.8.4 had a bug. For example,
      in code such as
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    @a = sort ($b, @a)
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">the result would omit the value <span class="Li">$b</span>.
        This is now fixed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>The optimisation for unnecessary assignments introduced in 5.8.4 could
      give spurious warnings. This has been fixed.</li>
  <li>Perl should now correctly detect and read BOM-marked and (BOMless) UTF-16
      scripts of either endianness.</li>
  <li>Creating a new thread when weak references exist was buggy, and would
      often cause warnings at interpreter destruction time. The known bug is now
      fixed.</li>
  <li>Several obscure bugs involving manipulating Unicode strings with
      <span class="Li">&quot;substr&quot;</span> have been fixed.</li>
  <li>Previously if Perl's file globbing function encountered a directory that
      it did not have permission to open it would return immediately, leading to
      unexpected truncation of the list of results. This has been fixed, to be
      consistent with Unix shells' globbing behaviour.</li>
  <li>Thread creation time could vary wildly between identical runs. This was
      caused by a poor hashing algorithm in the thread cloning routines, which
      has now been fixed.</li>
  <li>The internals of the ithreads implementation were not checking if OS-level
      thread creation had failed. threads-&gt;<i>create()</i> now returns
      <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> in if thread creation fails
      instead of crashing perl.</li>

The Unicode character class files used by the regular expression engine are now
  built at build time from the supplied Unicode consortium data files, instead
  of being shipped prebuilt. This makes the compressed Perl source tarball about
  200K smaller. A side effect is that the layout of files inside lib/unicore has
  changed.

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
  posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
  http://bugs.perl.org. There may also be information at http://www.perl.org,
  the Perl Home Page.
<p class="Pp">If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the
    <b>perlbug</b> program included with your release. Be sure to trim your bug
    down to a tiny but sufficient test case. Your bug report, along with the
    output of <span class="Li">&quot;perl -V&quot;</span>, will be sent off to
    perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team. You can browse and
    search the Perl 5 bugs at http://bugs.perl.org/</p>
