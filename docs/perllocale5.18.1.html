    localization)</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">In the beginning there was ASCII, the &quot;American Standard Code
    for Information Interchange&quot;, which works quite well for Americans with
    their English alphabet and dollar-denominated currency. But it doesn't work
    so well even for other English speakers, who may use different currencies,
    such as the pound sterling (as the symbol for that currency is not in
    ASCII); and it's hopelessly inadequate for many of the thousands of the
    world's other languages.</p>
<p class="Pp">To address these deficiencies, the concept of locales was invented
    (formally the ISO C, XPG4, POSIX 1.c &quot;locale system&quot;). And
    applications were and are being written that use the locale mechanism. The
    process of making such an application take account of its users' preferences
    in these kinds of matters is called <b>internationalization</b> (often
    abbreviated as <b>i18n</b>); telling such an application about a particular
    set of preferences is known as <b>localization</b> (<b>l10n</b>).</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl was extended to support the locale system. This is controlled
    per application by using one pragma, one function call, and several
    environment variables.</p>
<p class="Pp">Unfortunately, there are quite a few deficiencies with the design
    (and often, the implementations) of locales, and their use for character
    sets has mostly been supplanted by Unicode (see perlunitut for an
    introduction to that, and keep on reading here for how Unicode interacts
    with locales in Perl).</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl continues to support the old locale system, and starting in
    v5.16, provides a hybrid way to use the Unicode character set, along with
    the other portions of locales that may not be so problematic. (Unicode is
    also creating <span class="Li">&quot;CLDR&quot;</span>, the &quot;Common
    Locale Data Repository&quot;, &lt;http://cldr.unicode.org/&gt; which
    includes more types of information than are available in the POSIX locale
    system. At the time of this writing, there was no CPAN module that provides
    access to this XML-encoded data. However, many of its locales have the
    POSIX-only data extracted, and are available at
    &lt;http://unicode.org/Public/cldr/latest/&gt;.)</p>

  IS A LOCALE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">A locale is a set of data that describes various aspects of how
    various communities in the world categorize their world. These categories
    are broken down into the following types (some of which include a brief note
    here):</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="Category"><a class="permalink" href="#Category">Category LC_NUMERIC:
    Numeric formatting</a></dt>
  <dd>This indicates how numbers should be formatted for human readability, for
      example the character used as the decimal point.</dd>
  <dt id="Category~2"><a class="permalink" href="#Category~2">Category
    LC_MONETARY: Formatting of monetary amounts</a></dt>
  <dd>&#x00A0;</dd>
  <dt id="Category~3"><a class="permalink" href="#Category~3">Category LC_TIME:
    Date/Time formatting</a></dt>
  <dd>&#x00A0;</dd>
  <dt id="Category~4"><a class="permalink" href="#Category~4">Category
    LC_MESSAGES: Error and other messages</a></dt>
  <dd>This for the most part is beyond the scope of Perl</dd>
  <dt id="Category~5"><a class="permalink" href="#Category~5">Category
    LC_COLLATE: Collation</a></dt>
  <dd>This indicates the ordering of letters for comparison and sorting. In
      Latin alphabets, for example, &quot;b&quot;, generally follows
      &quot;a&quot;.</dd>
  <dt id="Category~6"><a class="permalink" href="#Category~6">Category LC_CTYPE:
    Character Types</a></dt>
  <dd>This indicates, for example if a character is an uppercase letter.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">More details on the categories are given below in &quot;LOCALE
    CATEGORIES&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">Together, these categories go a long way towards being able to
    customize a single program to run in many different locations. But there are
    deficiencies, so keep reading.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="PREPARING_TO_USE_LOCALES"><a class="permalink" href="#PREPARING_TO_USE_LOCALES">PREPARING
  TO USE LOCALES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Perl will not use locales unless specifically requested to (see
    &quot;NOTES&quot; below for the partial exception of
    <span class="Li">&quot;write()&quot;</span>). But even if there is such a
    request, <b>all</b> of the following must be true for it to work
  properly:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li><b>Your operating system must support the locale system</b>. If it does,
      you should find that the <i>setlocale()</i> function is a documented part
      of its C library.</li>
  <li><b>Definitions for locales that you use must be installed</b>. You, or
      your system administrator, must make sure that this is the case. The
      available locales, the location in which they are kept, and the manner in
      which they are installed all vary from system to system. Some systems
      provide only a few, hard-wired locales and do not allow more to be added.
      Others allow you to add &quot;canned&quot; locales provided by the system
      supplier. Still others allow you or the system administrator to define and
      add arbitrary locales. (You may have to ask your supplier to provide
      canned locales that are not delivered with your operating system.) Read
      your system documentation for further illumination.</li>
  <li><b>Perl must believe that the locale system is supported</b>. If it does,
      <span class="Li">&quot;perl -V:d_setlocale&quot;</span> will say that the
      value for <span class="Li">&quot;d_setlocale&quot;</span> is
      <span class="Li">&quot;define&quot;</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">If you want a Perl application to process and present your data
    according to a particular locale, the application code should include the
    <span class="Li">&quot;use&#x00A0;locale&quot;</span> pragma (see &quot;The
    use locale pragma&quot;) where appropriate, and <b>at least one</b> of the
    following must be true:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>1.</dt>
  <dd><b>The locale-determining environment variables (see
      &quot;ENVIRONMENT&quot;)</b> <b>must be correctly set up</b> at the time
      the application is started, either by yourself or by whomever set up your
      system account; or</dd>
  <dt>2.</dt>
  <dd><b>The application must set its own locale</b> using the method described
      in &quot;The setlocale function&quot;.</dd>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="The_use_locale_pragma"><a class="permalink" href="#The_use_locale_pragma">The
  use locale pragma</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">By default, Perl ignores the current locale. The
    <span class="Li">&quot;use&#x00A0;locale&quot;</span> pragma tells Perl to
    use the current locale for some operations. Starting in v5.16, there is an
    optional parameter to this pragma:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    use locale ':not_characters';
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This parameter allows better mixing of locales and Unicode, and is
    described fully in &quot;Unicode and UTF-8&quot;, but briefly, it tells Perl
    to not use the character portions of the locale definition, that is the
    <span class="Li">&quot;LC_CTYPE&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;LC_COLLATE&quot;</span> categories. Instead it will
    use the native (extended by Unicode) character set. When using this
    parameter, you are responsible for getting the external character set
    translated into the native/Unicode one (which it already will be if it is
    one of the increasingly popular UTF-8 locales). There are convenient ways of
    doing this, as described in &quot;Unicode and UTF-8&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">The current locale is set at execution time by <i>setlocale()</i>
    described below. If that function hasn't yet been called in the course of
    the program's execution, the current locale is that which was determined by
    the &quot;ENVIRONMENT&quot; in effect at the start of the program, except
    that <span class="Li">&quot;LC_NUMERIC&quot;</span> is always initialized to
    the C locale (mentioned under &quot;Finding locales&quot;). If there is no
    valid environment, the current locale is undefined. It is likely, but not
    necessarily, the &quot;C&quot; locale.</p>
<p class="Pp">The operations that are affected by locale are:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="Under"><a class="permalink" href="#Under"><b>Under </b><b>&quot;use
    locale ':not_characters';&quot;</b><b></b></a></dt>
  <dd></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li><b>Format declarations</b> (<i>format()</i>) use
      <span class="Li">&quot;LC_NUMERIC&quot;</span></li>
  <li><b>The POSIX date formatting function</b> (<i>strftime()</i>) uses
      <span class="Li">&quot;LC_TIME&quot;</span>.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">&#x00A0;</p>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="Under~2"><a class="permalink" href="#Under~2"><b>Under just plain
    </b><b>&quot;use locale;&quot;</b><b></b></a></dt>
  <dd>The above operations are affected, as well as the following:</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li><b>The comparison operators</b> (<span class="Li">&quot;lt&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;le&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;cmp&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;ge&quot;</span>, and
      <span class="Li">&quot;gt&quot;</span>) and the POSIX string collation
      functions <i>strcoll()</i> and <i>strxfrm()</i> use
      <span class="Li">&quot;LC_COLLATE&quot;</span>. <i>sort()</i> is also
      affected if used without an explicit comparison function, because it uses
      <span class="Li">&quot;cmp&quot;</span> by default.
    <p class="Pp"><b>Note:</b> <span class="Li">&quot;eq&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;ne&quot;</span> are unaffected by locale: they
        always perform a char-by-char comparison of their scalar operands.
        What's more, if <span class="Li">&quot;cmp&quot;</span> finds that its
        operands are equal according to the collation sequence specified by the
        current locale, it goes on to perform a char-by-char comparison, and
        only returns <i>0</i> (equal) if the operands are char-for-char
        identical. If you really want to know whether two strings--which
        <span class="Li">&quot;eq&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;cmp&quot;</span> may consider different--are
        equal as far as collation in the locale is concerned, see the discussion
        in &quot;Category LC_COLLATE: Collation&quot;.</p>
  </li>
  <li><b>Regular expressions and case-modification functions</b> (<i>uc()</i>,
      <i>lc()</i>, <i>ucfirst()</i>, and <i>lcfirst()</i>) use
      <span class="Li">&quot;LC_CTYPE&quot;</span></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="Bd-indent"></div>
<p class="Pp">The default behavior is restored with the
    <span class="Li">&quot;no&#x00A0;locale&quot;</span> pragma, or upon
    reaching the end of the block enclosing <span class="Li">&quot;use
    locale&quot;</span>. Note that <span class="Li">&quot;use
    locale&quot;</span> and <span class="Li">&quot;use locale
    ':not_characters'&quot;</span> may be nested, and that what is in effect
    within an inner scope will revert to the outer scope's rules at the end of
    the inner scope.</p>
<p class="Pp">The string result of any operation that uses locale information is
    tainted, as it is possible for a locale to be untrustworthy. See
    &quot;SECURITY&quot;.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="The_setlocale_function"><a class="permalink" href="#The_setlocale_function">The
  setlocale function</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">You can switch locales as often as you wish at run time with the
    <i>POSIX::setlocale()</i> function:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        # Import locale-handling tool set from POSIX module.
        # This example uses: setlocale -- the function call
        #                    LC_CTYPE -- explained below
        use POSIX qw(locale_h);
        # query and save the old locale
        $old_locale = setlocale(LC_CTYPE);
        setlocale(LC_CTYPE, &quot;fr_CA.ISO8859-1&quot;);
        # LC_CTYPE now in locale &quot;French, Canada, codeset ISO 8859-1&quot;
        setlocale(LC_CTYPE, &quot;&quot;);
        # LC_CTYPE now reset to default defined by LC_ALL/LC_CTYPE/LANG
        # environment variables.  See below for documentation.
        # restore the old locale
        setlocale(LC_CTYPE, $old_locale);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The first argument of <i>setlocale()</i> gives the
    <b>category</b>, the second the <b>locale</b>. The category tells in what
    aspect of data processing you want to apply locale-specific rules. Category
    names are discussed in &quot;LOCALE CATEGORIES&quot; and
    &quot;ENVIRONMENT&quot;. The locale is the name of a collection of
    customization information corresponding to a particular combination of
    language, country or territory, and codeset. Read on for hints on the naming
    of locales: not all systems name locales as in the example.</p>
<p class="Pp">If no second argument is provided and the category is something
    else than LC_ALL, the function returns a string naming the current locale
    for the category. You can use this value as the second argument in a
    subsequent call to <i>setlocale()</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">If no second argument is provided and the category is LC_ALL, the
    result is implementation-dependent. It may be a string of concatenated
    locale names (separator also implementation-dependent) or a single locale
    name. Please consult your <i>setlocale</i>(3) man page for details.</p>
<p class="Pp">If a second argument is given and it corresponds to a valid
    locale, the locale for the category is set to that value, and the function
    returns the now-current locale value. You can then use this in yet another
    call to <i>setlocale()</i>. (In some implementations, the return value may
    sometimes differ from the value you gave as the second argument--think of it
    as an alias for the value you gave.)</p>
<p class="Pp">As the example shows, if the second argument is an empty string,
    the category's locale is returned to the default specified by the
    corresponding environment variables. Generally, this results in a return to
    the default that was in force when Perl started up: changes to the
    environment made by the application after startup may or may not be noticed,
    depending on your system's C library.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the second argument does not correspond to a valid locale, the
    locale for the category is not changed, and the function returns
    <i>undef</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that Perl ignores the current
    <span class="Li">&quot;LC_CTYPE&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;LC_COLLATE&quot;</span> locales within the scope of a
    <span class="Li">&quot;use locale ':not_characters'&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">For further information about the categories, consult
    <i>setlocale</i>(3).</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Finding_locales"><a class="permalink" href="#Finding_locales">Finding
  locales</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">For locales available in your system, consult also
    <i>setlocale</i>(3) to see whether it leads to the list of available locales
    (search for the <i>SEE ALSO</i> section). If that fails, try the following
    command lines:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        locale -a
        nlsinfo
        ls /usr/lib/nls/loc
        ls /usr/lib/locale
        ls /usr/lib/nls
        ls /usr/share/locale
</pre>
<p class="Pp">and see whether they list something resembling these</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        en_US.ISO8859-1     de_DE.ISO8859-1     ru_RU.ISO8859-5
        en_US.iso88591      de_DE.iso88591      ru_RU.iso88595
        en_US               de_DE               ru_RU
        en                  de                  ru
        english             german              russian
        english.iso88591    german.iso88591     russian.iso88595
        english.roman8                          russian.koi8r
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Sadly, even though the calling interface for <i>setlocale()</i>
    has been standardized, names of locales and the directories where the
    configuration resides have not been. The basic form of the name is
    <i>language_territory</i><b>.</b><i>codeset</i>, but the latter parts after
    <i>language</i> are not always present. The <i>language</i> and
    <i>country</i> are usually from the standards <b>ISO 3166</b> and <b>ISO
    639</b>, the two-letter abbreviations for the countries and the languages of
    the world, respectively. The <i>codeset</i> part often mentions some
    <b>ISO</b> <b>8859</b> character set, the Latin codesets. For example,
    <span class="Li">&quot;ISO 8859-1&quot;</span> is the so-called
    &quot;Western European codeset&quot; that can be used to encode most Western
    European languages adequately. Again, there are several ways to write even
    the name of that one standard. Lamentably.</p>
<p class="Pp">Two special locales are worth particular mention: &quot;C&quot;
    and &quot;POSIX&quot;. Currently these are effectively the same locale: the
    difference is mainly that the first one is defined by the C standard, the
    second by the POSIX standard. They define the <b>default locale</b> in which
    every program starts in the absence of locale information in its
    environment. (The <i>default</i> default locale, if you will.) Its language
    is (American) English and its character codeset ASCII. <b>Warning</b>. The C
    locale delivered by some vendors may not actually exactly match what the C
    standard calls for. So beware.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>NOTE</b>: Not all systems have the &quot;POSIX&quot; locale
    (not all systems are POSIX-conformant), so use &quot;C&quot; when you need
    explicitly to specify this default locale.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">LOCALE PROBLEMS</h2>
<p class="Pp">You may encounter the following warning message at Perl
  startup:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        perl: warning: Setting locale failed.
        perl: warning: Please check that your locale settings:
                LC_ALL = &quot;En_US&quot;,
                LANG = (unset)
            are supported and installed on your system.
        perl: warning: Falling back to the standard locale (&quot;C&quot;).
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This means that your locale settings had LC_ALL set to
    &quot;En_US&quot; and LANG exists but has no value. Perl tried to believe
    you but could not. Instead, Perl gave up and fell back to the &quot;C&quot;
    locale, the default locale that is supposed to work no matter what. This
    usually means your locale settings were wrong, they mention locales your
    system has never heard of, or the locale installation in your system has
    problems (for example, some system files are broken or missing). There are
    quick and temporary fixes to these problems, as well as more thorough and
    lasting fixes.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Temporarily_fixing_locale_problems"><a class="permalink" href="#Temporarily_fixing_locale_problems">Temporarily
  fixing locale problems</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The two quickest fixes are either to render Perl silent about any
    locale inconsistencies or to run Perl under the default locale
    &quot;C&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl's moaning about locale problems can be silenced by setting
    the environment variable PERL_BADLANG to a zero value, for example
    &quot;0&quot;. This method really just sweeps the problem under the carpet:
    you tell Perl to shut up even when Perl sees that something is wrong. Do not
    be surprised if later something locale-dependent misbehaves.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl can be run under the &quot;C&quot; locale by setting the
    environment variable LC_ALL to &quot;C&quot;. This method is perhaps a bit
    more civilized than the PERL_BADLANG approach, but setting LC_ALL (or other
    locale variables) may affect other programs as well, not just Perl. In
    particular, external programs run from within Perl will see these changes.
    If you make the new settings permanent (read on), all programs you run see
    the changes. See &quot;ENVIRONMENT&quot; for the full list of relevant
    environment variables and &quot;USING LOCALES&quot; for their effects in
    Perl. Effects in other programs are easily deducible. For example, the
    variable LC_COLLATE may well affect your <b>sort</b> program (or whatever
    the program that arranges &quot;records&quot; alphabetically in your system
    is called).</p>
<p class="Pp">You can test out changing these variables temporarily, and if the
    new settings seem to help, put those settings into your shell startup files.
    Consult your local documentation for the exact details. For in Bourne-like
    shells (<b>sh</b>, <b>ksh</b>, <b>bash</b>, <b>zsh</b>):</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        LC_ALL=en_US.ISO8859-1
        export LC_ALL
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This assumes that we saw the locale &quot;en_US.ISO8859-1&quot;
    using the commands discussed above. We decided to try that instead of the
    above faulty locale &quot;En_US&quot;--and in Cshish shells (<b>csh</b>,
    <b>tcsh</b>)</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>

<p class="Pp">First, see earlier in this document about &quot;Finding
    locales&quot;. That tells how to find which locales are really
    supported--and more importantly, installed--on your system. In our example
    error message, environment variables affecting the locale are listed in the
    order of decreasing importance (and unset variables do not matter).
    Therefore, having LC_ALL set to &quot;En_US&quot; must have been the bad
    choice, as shown by the error message. First try fixing locale settings
    listed first.</p>
<p class="Pp">Second, if using the listed commands you see something
    <b>exactly</b> (prefix matches do not count and case usually counts) like
    &quot;En_US&quot; without the quotes, then you should be okay because you
    are using a locale name that should be installed and available in your
    system. In this case, see &quot;Permanently fixing your system's locale
    configuration&quot;.</p>

  localeconv function</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The <i>POSIX::localeconv()</i> function allows you to get
    particulars of the locale-dependent numeric formatting information specified
    by the current <span class="Li">&quot;LC_NUMERIC&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;LC_MONETARY&quot;</span> locales. (If you just want
    the name of the current locale for a particular category, use
    <i>POSIX::setlocale()</i> with a single parameter--see &quot;The setlocale
    function&quot;.)</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        use POSIX qw(locale_h);

            printf &quot;%-20s = %s\n&quot;, $_, $locale_values-&gt;{$_}
        }
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><i>localeconv()</i> takes no arguments, and returns <b>a reference
    to</b> a hash. The keys of this hash are variable names for formatting, such
    as <span class="Li">&quot;decimal_point&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;thousands_sep&quot;</span>. The values are the
    corresponding, er, values. See &quot;localeconv&quot; in POSIX for a longer
    example listing the categories an implementation might be expected to
    provide; some provide more and others fewer. You don't need an explicit
    <span class="Li">&quot;use locale&quot;</span>, because <i>localeconv()</i>
    always observes the current locale.</p>
<p class="Pp">Here's a simple-minded example program that rewrites its

    $thousands_sep = ',' unless $thousands_sep;
    # grouping and mon_grouping are packed lists
    # of small integers (characters) telling the
    # grouping (thousand_seps and mon_thousand_seps
    # being the group dividers) of numbers and
    # monetary quantities.  The integers' meanings:
    # 255 means no more grouping, 0 means repeat
    # the previous grouping, 1-254 means use that
    # as the current grouping.  Grouping goes from
    # right to left (low to high digits).  In the
    # below we cheat slightly by never using anything
    # else than the first grouping (whatever that is).

        1 while

<h2 class="Ss">Category LC_COLLATE: Collation</h2>
<p class="Pp">In the scope of
    <span class="Li">&quot;use&#x00A0;locale&quot;</span> (but not a
    <span class="Li">&quot;use locale ':not_characters'&quot;</span>), Perl
    looks to the <span class="Li">&quot;LC_COLLATE&quot;</span> environment
    variable to determine the application's notions on collation (ordering) of
    characters. For example, &quot;b&quot; follows &quot;a&quot; in Latin
    alphabets, but where do &quot;a&quot; and &quot;aa&quot; belong? And while
    &quot;color&quot; follows &quot;chocolate&quot; in English, what about in
    traditional Spanish?</p>
<p class="Pp">The following collations all make sense and you may meet any of
    them if you &quot;use locale&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        A B C D E a b c d e
        A a B b C c D d E e
        a A b B c C d D e E
        a b c d e A B C D E
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Here is a code snippet to tell what &quot;word&quot; characters
    are in the current locale, in that locale's order:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        use locale;
        print +(sort grep /\w/, map { chr } 0..255), &quot;\n&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Compare this with the characters that you see and their order if
    you state explicitly that the locale should be ignored:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        no locale;
        print +(sort grep /\w/, map { chr } 0..255), &quot;\n&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This machine-native collation (which is what you get unless
    <span class="Li">&quot;use&#x00A0;locale&quot;</span> has appeared earlier
    in the same block) must be used for sorting raw binary data, whereas the
    locale-dependent collation of the first example is useful for natural
  text.</p>
<p class="Pp">As noted in &quot;USING LOCALES&quot;,
    <span class="Li">&quot;cmp&quot;</span> compares according to the current
    collation locale when <span class="Li">&quot;use locale&quot;</span> is in
    effect, but falls back to a char-by-char comparison for strings that the
    locale says are equal. You can use <i>POSIX::strcoll()</i> if you don't want
    this fall-back:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        use POSIX qw(strcoll);
        $equal_in_locale =
            !strcoll(&quot;space and case ignored&quot;, &quot;SpaceAndCaseIgnored&quot;);
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">$equal_in_locale</span> will be true if the
    collation locale specifies a dictionary-like ordering that ignores space
    characters completely and which folds case.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you have a single string that you want to check for
    &quot;equality in locale&quot; against several others, you might think you
    could gain a little efficiency by using <i>POSIX::strxfrm()</i> in
    conjunction with <span class="Li">&quot;eq&quot;</span>:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        use POSIX qw(strxfrm);
        $xfrm_string = strxfrm(&quot;Mixed-case string&quot;);
        print &quot;locale collation ignores spaces\n&quot;
            if $xfrm_string eq strxfrm(&quot;Mixed-casestring&quot;);
        print &quot;locale collation ignores hyphens\n&quot;
            if $xfrm_string eq strxfrm(&quot;Mixedcase string&quot;);
        print &quot;locale collation ignores case\n&quot;
            if $xfrm_string eq strxfrm(&quot;mixed-case string&quot;);
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><i>strxfrm()</i> takes a string and maps it into a transformed
    string for use in char-by-char comparisons against other transformed strings
    during collation. &quot;Under the hood&quot;, locale-affected Perl
    comparison operators call <i>strxfrm()</i> for both operands, then do a
    char-by-char comparison of the transformed strings. By calling
    <i>strxfrm()</i> explicitly and using a non locale-affected comparison, the
    example attempts to save a couple of transformations. But in fact, it
    doesn't save anything: Perl magic (see &quot;Magic Variables&quot; in
    perlguts) creates the transformed version of a string the first time it's
    needed in a comparison, then keeps this version around in case it's needed
    again. An example rewritten the easy way with
    <span class="Li">&quot;cmp&quot;</span> runs just about as fast. It also
    copes with null characters embedded in strings; if you call <i>strxfrm()</i>
    directly, it treats the first null it finds as a terminator. don't expect
    the transformed strings it produces to be portable across systems--or even
    from one revision of your operating system to the next. In short, don't call
    <i>strxfrm()</i> directly: let Perl do it for you.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note: <span class="Li">&quot;use locale&quot;</span> isn't shown
    in some of these examples because it isn't needed: <i>strcoll()</i> and
    <i>strxfrm()</i> exist only to generate locale-dependent results, and so
    always obey the current <span class="Li">&quot;LC_COLLATE&quot;</span>
    locale.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">Category LC_CTYPE: Character Types</h2>
<p class="Pp">In the scope of
    <span class="Li">&quot;use&#x00A0;locale&quot;</span> (but not a
    <span class="Li">&quot;use locale ':not_characters'&quot;</span>), Perl
    obeys the <span class="Li">&quot;LC_CTYPE&quot;</span> locale setting. This
    controls the application's notion of which characters are alphabetic. This
    affects Perl's <span class="Li">&quot;\w&quot;</span> regular expression
    metanotation, which stands for alphanumeric characters--that is, alphabetic,
    numeric, and including other special characters such as the underscore or
    hyphen. (Consult perlre for more information about regular expressions.)
    Thanks to <span class="Li">&quot;LC_CTYPE&quot;</span>, depending on your
    locale setting, characters like &quot;ae&quot;, &quot;d`&quot;,
    &quot;ss&quot;, and &quot;o&quot; may be understood as
    <span class="Li">&quot;\w&quot;</span> characters.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;LC_CTYPE&quot;</span> locale also
    provides the map used in transliterating characters between lower and
    uppercase. This affects the case-mapping functions--<i>lc()</i>, lcfirst,
    <i>uc()</i>, and <i>ucfirst()</i>; case-mapping interpolation with
    <span class="Li">&quot;\l&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;\L&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;\u&quot;</span>, or
    <span class="Li">&quot;\U&quot;</span> in double-quoted strings and
    <span class="Li">&quot;s///&quot;</span> substitutions; and case-independent
    regular expression pattern matching using the
    <span class="Li">&quot;i&quot;</span> modifier.</p>
<p class="Pp">Finally, <span class="Li">&quot;LC_CTYPE&quot;</span> affects the
    POSIX character-class test functions--<i>isalpha()</i>, <i>islower()</i>,
    and so on. For example, if you move from the &quot;C&quot; locale to a 7-bit
    Scandinavian one, you may find--possibly to your surprise--that
    &quot;|&quot; moves from the <i>ispunct()</i> class to <i>isalpha()</i>.
    Unfortunately, this creates big problems for regular expressions.
    &quot;|&quot; still means alternation even though it matches
    <span class="Li">&quot;\w&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that there are quite a few things that are unaffected by the
    current locale. All the escape sequences for particular characters,
    <span class="Li">&quot;\n&quot;</span> for example, always mean the
    platform's native one. This means, for example, that
    <span class="Li">&quot;\N&quot;</span> in regular expressions (every
    character but new-line) work on the platform character set.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Note:</b> A broken or malicious
    <span class="Li">&quot;LC_CTYPE&quot;</span> locale definition may result in
    clearly ineligible characters being considered to be alphanumeric by your
    application. For strict matching of (mundane) ASCII letters and digits--for
    example, in command strings--locale-aware applications should use
    <span class="Li">&quot;\w&quot;</span> with the
    <span class="Li">&quot;/a&quot;</span> regular expression modifier. See
    &quot;SECURITY&quot;.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">Category LC_NUMERIC: Numeric Formatting</h2>
<p class="Pp">After a proper <i>POSIX::setlocale()</i> call, Perl obeys the
    <span class="Li">&quot;LC_NUMERIC&quot;</span> locale information, which
    controls an application's idea of how numbers should be formatted for human
    readability by the <i>printf()</i>, <i>sprintf()</i>, and <i>write()</i>
    functions. String-to-numeric conversion by the <i>POSIX::strtod()</i>
    function is also affected. In most implementations the only effect is to
    change the character used for the decimal point--perhaps from &quot;.&quot;
    to &quot;,&quot;. These functions aren't aware of such niceties as thousands
    separation and so on. (See &quot;The localeconv function&quot; if you care
    about these things.)</p>
<p class="Pp">Output produced by <i>print()</i> is also affected by the current
    locale: it corresponds to what you'd get from <i>printf()</i> in the
    &quot;C&quot; locale. The same is true for Perl's internal conversions
    between numeric and string formats:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        use POSIX qw(strtod setlocale LC_NUMERIC);
        setlocale LC_NUMERIC, &quot;&quot;;

        $a = &quot; $n&quot;; # Locale-dependent conversion to string
        print &quot;half five is $n\n&quot;;       # Locale-dependent output
        printf &quot;half five is %g\n&quot;, $n;  # Locale-dependent output
        print &quot;DECIMAL POINT IS COMMA\n&quot;

    that it returns in your application's own formatting of currency amounts.

<p class="Pp">Although the main discussion of Perl security issues can be found
    in perlsec, a discussion of Perl's locale handling would be incomplete if it
    did not draw your attention to locale-dependent security issues.
    Locales--particularly on systems that allow unprivileged users to build
    their own locales--are untrustworthy. A malicious (or just plain broken)
    locale can make a locale-aware application give unexpected results. Here are
    a few possibilities:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Regular expression checks for safe file names or mail addresses using
      <span class="Li">&quot;\w&quot;</span> may be spoofed by an
      <span class="Li">&quot;LC_CTYPE&quot;</span> locale that claims that
      characters such as &quot;&gt;&quot; and &quot;|&quot; are
    alphanumeric.</li>
  <li>String interpolation with case-mapping, as in, say,
      <span class="Li">&quot;$dest =</span>
      <span class="Li">&quot;C:\U$name.$ext&quot;&quot;</span>, may produce
      dangerous results if a bogus LC_CTYPE case-mapping table is in
    effect.</li>
  <li>A sneaky <span class="Li">&quot;LC_COLLATE&quot;</span> locale could
      result in the names of students with &quot;D&quot; grades appearing ahead
      of those with &quot;A&quot;s.</li>
  <li>An application that takes the trouble to use information in
      <span class="Li">&quot;LC_MONETARY&quot;</span> may format debits as if
      they were credits and vice versa if that locale has been subverted. Or it
      might make payments in US dollars instead of Hong Kong dollars.</li>
  <li>The date and day names in dates formatted by <i>strftime()</i> could be
      manipulated to advantage by a malicious user able to subvert the
      <span class="Li">&quot;LC_DATE&quot;</span> locale. (&quot;Look--it says I
      wasn't in the building on Sunday.&quot;)</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">Such dangers are not peculiar to the locale system: any aspect of
    an application's environment which may be modified maliciously presents
    similar challenges. Similarly, they are not specific to Perl: any
    programming language that allows you to write programs that take account of
    their environment exposes you to these issues.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl cannot protect you from all possibilities shown in the
    examples--there is no substitute for your own vigilance--but, when
    <span class="Li">&quot;use locale&quot;</span> is in effect, Perl uses the
    tainting mechanism (see perlsec) to mark string results that become
    locale-dependent, and which may be untrustworthy in consequence. Here is a
    summary of the tainting behavior of operators and functions that may be
    affected by the locale:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">

    the program environment suggested otherwise (see &quot;The setlocale
    function&quot;). By default, Perl still behaves this way for backward
    compatibility. If you want a Perl application to pay attention to locale
    information, you <b>must</b> use the
    <span class="Li">&quot;use&#x00A0;locale&quot;</span> pragma (see &quot;The

    it will take 3-15 times more memory than before. (The exact multiplier
    depends on the string's contents, the operating system and the locale.)

<h1 class="Sh" id="Unicode_and_UTF"><a class="permalink" href="#Unicode_and_UTF">Unicode
  and UTF-8</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The support of Unicode is new starting from Perl version v5.6, and
    more fully implemented in version v5.8 and later. See perluniintro. It is
    strongly recommended that when combining Unicode and locale (starting in
    v5.16), you use</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    use locale ':not_characters';
</pre>
<p class="Pp">When this form of the pragma is used, only the non-character
    portions of locales are used by Perl, for example
    <span class="Li">&quot;LC_NUMERIC&quot;</span>. Perl assumes that you have
    translated all the characters it is to operate on into Unicode (actually the
    platform's native character set (ASCII or EBCDIC) plus Unicode). For data in
    files, this can conveniently be done by also specifying</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    use open ':locale';
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This pragma arranges for all inputs from files to be translated
    into Unicode from the current locale as specified in the environment (see
    &quot;ENVIRONMENT&quot;), and all outputs to files to be translated back
    into the locale. (See open). On a per-filehandle basis, you can instead use
    the PerlIO::locale module, or the Encode::Locale module, both available from
    CPAN. The latter module also has methods to ease the handling of
    <span class="Li">&quot;ARGV&quot;</span> and environment variables, and can
    be used on individual strings. Also, if you know that all your locales will
    be UTF-8, as many are these days, you can use the <b>-C</b> command line
    switch.</p>
<p class="Pp">This form of the pragma allows essentially seamless handling of
    locales with Unicode. The collation order will be Unicode's. It is strongly
    recommended that when you need to order and sort strings that you use the
    standard module Unicode::Collate which gives much better results in many
    instances than you can get with the old-style locale handling.</p>
<p class="Pp">For pre-v5.16 Perls, or if you use the locale pragma without the
    <span class="Li">&quot;:not_characters&quot;</span> parameter, Perl tries to
    work with both Unicode and locales--but there are problems.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl does not handle multi-byte locales in this case, such as have
    been used for various Asian languages, such as Big5 or Shift JIS. However,
    the increasingly common multi-byte UTF-8 locales, if properly implemented,
    may work reasonably well (depending on your C library implementation) in
    this form of the locale pragma, simply because both they and Perl store
    characters that take up multiple bytes the same way. However, some, if not
    most, C library implementations may not process the characters in the upper
    half of the Latin-1 range (128 - 255) properly under LC_CTYPE. To see if a
    character is a particular type under a locale, Perl uses the functions like
    <span class="Li">&quot;isalnum()&quot;</span>. Your C library may not work
    for UTF-8 locales with those functions, instead only working under the newer
    wide library functions like
  <span class="Li">&quot;iswalnum()&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl generally takes the tack to use locale rules on code points
    that can fit in a single byte, and Unicode rules for those that can't
    (though this isn't uniformly applied, see the note at the end of this
    section). This prevents many problems in locales that aren't UTF-8. Suppose
    the locale is ISO8859-7, Greek. The character at 0xD7 there is a capital
    Chi. But in the ISO8859-1 locale, Latin1, it is a multiplication sign. The
    POSIX regular expression character class
    <span class="Li">&quot;[[:alpha:]]&quot;</span> will magically match 0xD7 in
    the Greek locale but not in the Latin one.</p>
<p class="Pp">However, there are places where this breaks down. Certain
    constructs are for Unicode only, such as
    <span class="Li">&quot;\p{Alpha}&quot;</span>. They assume that 0xD7 always
    has its Unicode meaning (or the equivalent on EBCDIC platforms). Since
    Latin1 is a subset of Unicode and 0xD7 is the multiplication sign in both
    Latin1 and Unicode, <span class="Li">&quot;\p{Alpha}&quot;</span> will never
    match it, regardless of locale. A similar issue occurs with
    <span class="Li">&quot;\N{...}&quot;</span>. It is therefore a bad idea to
    use <span class="Li">&quot;\p{}&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;\N{}&quot;</span> under plain
    <span class="Li">&quot;use locale&quot;</span>--<i>unless</i> you can
    guarantee that the locale will be a ISO8859-1. Use POSIX character classes
    instead.</p>
<p class="Pp">Another problem with this approach is that operations that cross
    the single byte/multiple byte boundary are not well-defined, and so are
    disallowed. (This boundary is between the codepoints at 255/256.). For
    example, lower casing LATIN CAPITAL LETTER Y WITH DIAERESIS (U+0178) should
    return LATIN SMALL LETTER Y WITH DIAERESIS (U+00FF). But in the Greek
    locale, for example, there is no character at 0xFF, and Perl has no way of
    knowing what the character at 0xFF is really supposed to represent. Thus it
    disallows the operation. In this mode, the lowercase of U+0178 is
  itself.</p>
<p class="Pp">The same problems ensue if you enable automatic UTF-8-ification of
    your standard file handles, default
    <span class="Li">&quot;open()&quot;</span> layer, and
    <span class="Li">@ARGV</span> on non-ISO8859-1, non-UTF-8 locales (by using
    either the <b>-C</b> command line switch or the
    <span class="Li">&quot;PERL_UNICODE&quot;</span> environment variable; see
    perlrun). Things are read in as UTF-8, which would normally imply a Unicode
    interpretation, but the presence of a locale causes them to be interpreted
    in that locale instead. For example, a 0xD7 code point in the Unicode input,
    which should mean the multiplication sign, won't be interpreted by Perl that
    way under the Greek locale. This is not a problem <i>provided</i> you make
    certain that all locales will always and only be either an ISO8859-1, or, if
    you don't have a deficient C library, a UTF-8 locale.</p>
<p class="Pp">Vendor locales are notoriously buggy, and it is difficult for Perl
    to test its locale-handling code because this interacts with code that Perl
    has no control over; therefore the locale-handling code in Perl may be buggy
    as well. (However, the Unicode-supplied locales should be better, and there
    is a feed back mechanism to correct any problems. See &quot;Freely available
    locale definitions&quot;.)</p>
<p class="Pp">If you have Perl v5.16, the problems mentioned above go away if
    you use the <span class="Li">&quot;:not_characters&quot;</span> parameter to
    the locale pragma (except for vendor bugs in the non-character portions). If
    you don't have v5.16, and you <i>do</i> have locales that work, using them
    may be worthwhile for certain specific purposes, as long as you keep in mind
    the gotchas already mentioned. For example, if the collation for your
    locales works, it runs faster under locales than under Unicode::Collate; and
    you gain access to such things as the local currency symbol and the names of
    the months and days of the week. (But to hammer home the point, in v5.16,
    you get this access without the downsides of locales by using the
    <span class="Li">&quot;:not_characters&quot;</span> form of the pragma.)</p>
<p class="Pp">Note: The policy of using locale rules for code points that can
    fit in a byte, and Unicode rules for those that can't is not uniformly
    applied. Pre-v5.12, it was somewhat haphazard; in v5.12 it was applied
    fairly consistently to regular expression matching except for bracketed
    character classes; in v5.14 it was extended to all regex matches; and in
    v5.16 to the casing operations such as
    <span class="Li">&quot;\L&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;uc()&quot;</span>. For collation, in all releases,
    the system's <span class="Li">&quot;strxfrm()&quot;</span> function is
    called, and whatever it does is what you get.</p>

<p class="Pp">In certain systems, the operating system's locale support is
    broken and cannot be fixed or used by Perl. Such deficiencies can and will
    result in mysterious hangs and/or Perl core dumps when
    <span class="Li">&quot;use locale&quot;</span> is in effect. When confronted
    with such a system, please report in excruciating detail to
    &lt;<i>perlbug@perl.org</i>&gt;, and also contact your vendor: bug fixes may
    exist for these problems in your operating system. Sometimes such bug fixes
    are called an operating system upgrade.</p>
