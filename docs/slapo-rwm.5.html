<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
The <b>rwm</b> overlay to <b>slapd</b>(8) performs basic DN/data rewrite and
  objectClass/attributeType mapping. Its usage is mostly intended to provide
  virtual views of existing data either remotely, in conjunction with the proxy
  backend described in <b>slapd-ldap</b>(5), or locally, in conjunction with the
  relay backend described in <b>slapd-relay</b>(5).
<p class="Pp">This overlay is experimental.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="MAPPING"><a class="permalink" href="#MAPPING">MAPPING</a></h1>
An important feature of the <b>rwm</b> overlay is the capability to map
  objectClasses and attributeTypes from the local set (or a subset of it) to a
  foreign set, and vice versa. This is accomplished by means of the
  <b>rwm-map</b> directive.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>rwm-map {attribute | objectclass} [&lt;local name&gt; | *] {&lt;foreign
    name&gt; | *}</b></dt>
  <dd>Map attributeTypes and objectClasses from the foreign server to different
      values on the local slapd. The reason is that some attributes might not be
      part of the local slapd's schema, some attribute names might be different
      but serve the same purpose, etc. If local or foreign name is `*', the name
      is preserved. If local name is omitted, the foreign name is removed.
      Unmapped names are preserved if both local and foreign name are `*', and
      removed if local name is omitted and foreign name is `*'.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The local <i>objectClasses</i> and <i>attributeTypes</i> must be
    defined in the local schema; the foreign ones do not have to, but users are
    encouraged to explicitly define the remote attributeTypes and the
    objectClasses they intend to map. All in all, when remapping a remote server
    via back-ldap (<b>slapd-ldap</b>(5)) or back-meta (<b>slapd-meta</b>(5))
    their definition can be easily obtained by querying the
    <i>subschemaSubentry</i> of the remote server; the problem should not exist
    when remapping a local database. Note, however, that the decision whether to
    rewrite or not attributeTypes with <i>distinguishedName syntax</i>, requires
    the knowledge of the attributeType syntax. See the REWRITING section for
    details.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that when mapping DN-valued attributes from local to remote,
    first the DN is rewritten, and then the attributeType is mapped; while
    mapping from remote to local, first the attributeType is mapped, and then
    the DN is rewritten. As such, it is important that the local attributeType
    is appropriately defined as using the distinguishedName syntax. Also, note
    that there are DN-related syntaxes (i.e. compound types with a portion that
    is DN-valued), like nameAndOptionalUID, whose values are currently not
    rewritten.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the foreign type of an attribute mapping is not defined on the
    local server, it might be desirable to have the attribute values normalized
    after the mapping process. Not normalizing the values can lead to wrong
    results, when the <b>rwm</b> overlay is used together with e.g. the
    <b>pcache</b> overlay. This normalization can be enabled by means of the
    <b>rwm-normalize-mapped-attrs</b> directive.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>rwm-normalize-mapped-attrs {yes|no}</b></dt>
  <dd>Set this to &quot;yes&quot;, if the <b>rwm</b> overlay should try to
      normalize the values of attributes that are mapped from an attribute type
      that is unknown to the local server. The default value of this setting is
      &quot;no&quot;.</dd>
  <dt><b>rwm-drop-unrequested-attrs {yes|no}</b></dt>
  <dd>Set this to &quot;yes&quot;, if the <b>rwm</b> overlay should drop
      attributes that are not explicitly requested by a search operation. When
      this is set to &quot;no&quot;, the <b>rwm</b> overlay will leave all
      attributes in place, so that subsequent modules can further manipulate
      them. In any case, unrequested attributes will be omitted from search
      results by the frontend, when the search entry response package is
      encoded. The default value of this setting is &quot;yes&quot;.</dd>
</dl>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="SUFFIX_MASSAGING"><a class="permalink" href="#SUFFIX_MASSAGING">SUFFIX
  MASSAGING</a></h1>
A basic feature of the <b>rwm</b> overlay is the capability to perform suffix
  massaging between a virtual and a real naming context by means of the
  <b>rwm-suffixmassage</b> directive. This, in conjunction with proxy backends,
  <b>slapd-ldap</b>(5) and <b>slapd-meta</b>(5), or with the relay backend,
  <b>slapd-relay</b>(5), allows to create virtual views of databases. A
  distinguishing feature of this overlay is that, when instantiated before any
  database, it can modify the DN of requests <i>before</i> database selection.
  For this reason, rules that rewrite the empty DN (&quot;&quot;) or the
  subschemaSubentry DN (usually &quot;cn=subschema&quot;), would prevent clients
  from reading the root DSE or the DSA's schema.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>rwm-suffixmassage [&lt;virtual naming context&gt;] &lt;real naming
    context&gt;</b></dt>
  <dd>Shortcut to implement naming context rewriting; the trailing part of the
      DN is rewritten from the virtual to the real naming context in the bindDN,
      searchDN, searchFilterAttrDN, compareDN, compareAttrDN, addDN, addAttrDN,
      modifyDN, modifyAttrDN, modrDN, newSuperiorDN, deleteDN, exopPasswdDN, and
      from the real to the virtual naming context in the searchEntryDN,
      searchAttrDN and matchedDN rewrite contexts. By default no rewriting
      occurs for the searchFilter and for the referralAttrDN and referralDN
      rewrite contexts. If no <i>&lt;virtual naming context&gt;</i> is given,
      the first suffix of the database is used; this requires the
      <b>rwm-suffixmassage</b> directive be defined <i>after</i> the database
      <b>suffix</b> directive. The <b>rwm-suffixmassage</b> directive
      automatically sets the <b>rwm-rewriteEngine</b> to <b>ON</b>.</dd>

A string is rewritten according to a set of rules, called a `rewrite context'.
  The rules are based on POSIX (''extended'') regular expressions with substring
  matching; basic variable substitution and map resolution of substrings is
  allowed by specific mechanisms detailed in the following. The behavior of
  pattern matching/substitution can be altered by a set of flags.
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">

&lt;rewrite context&gt; ::= &lt;rewrite rule&gt; [...]
&lt;rewrite rule&gt; ::= &lt;pattern&gt; &lt;action&gt; [&lt;flags&gt;]

<p class="Pp">The underlying concept is to build a lightweight rewrite module

</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="Passes"><a class="permalink" href="#Passes">Passes</a></h1>
An incoming string is matched against a set of <i>rewriteRules</i>. Rules are
  made of a <i>regex match pattern</i>, a <i>substitution pattern</i> and a set
  of actions, described by a set of <i>optional flags</i>. In case of match,
  string rewriting is performed according to the substitution pattern that
  allows to refer to substrings matched in the incoming string. The actions, if
  any, are finally performed. Each rule is executed recursively, unless altered
  by specific action flags; see &quot;Action Flags&quot; for details. A default
  limit on the recursion level is set, and can be altered by the
  <b>rwm-rewriteMaxPasses</b> directive, as detailed in the &quot;Additional
  Configuration Syntax&quot; section. The substitution pattern allows map
  resolution of substrings. A map is a generic object that maps a substitution
  pattern to a value. The flags are divided in &quot;Pattern Matching
  Flags&quot; and &quot;Action Flags&quot;; the former alter the regex match
  pattern behavior, while the latter alter the actions that are taken after
  substitution.

      value `32' (indicating noSuchObject) after exactly one execution of the
      rule, if the pattern matches. As a consequence, its behavior is equivalent
      to `@', with the return code set to <b>n</b>; or, in other words, `@' is
      equivalent to `U{0}'. Positive errors are allowed, indicating the related
      LDAP error codes as specified in <i>draft-ietf-ldapbis-protocol</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The ordering of the flags can be significant. For instance:
    `IG{2}' means ignore errors and jump two lines ahead both in case of match
    and in case of error, while `G{2}I' means ignore errors, but jump two lines
    ahead only in case of match.</p>
<p class="Pp">More flags (mainly Action Flags) will be added as needed.</p>

A rewrite context is a set of rules which are applied in sequence. The basic
  idea is to have an application initialize a rewrite engine (think of Apache's
  mod_rewrite ...) with a set of rewrite contexts; when string rewriting is
  required, one invokes the appropriate rewrite context with the input string
  and obtains the newly rewritten one if no errors occur.

# Then we need to detect DN made up of a single email,
# e.g. `mail=someone@example.com'; note that the rule
# in case of match stops rewriting; in case of error,
# it is ignored.  In case we are mapping virtual
# to real naming contexts, we also need to rewrite
# regular DNs, because the definition of a bindDN
# rewrite context overrides the default definition.

# This is a rather sophisticated example. It massages a
# search filter in case who performs the search has
# administrative privileges.  First we need to keep
# track of the bind DN of the incoming request, which is
# stored in a variable called `binddn' with session scope,
# and left in place to allow regular binding:
rwm-rewriteContext  bindDN
rwm-rewriteRule     &quot;.+&quot; &quot;${&amp;&amp;binddn($0)}$0&quot; &quot;:&quot;
# A search filter containing `uid=' is rewritten only
# if an appropriate DN is bound.
# To do this, in the first rule the bound DN is
# dereferenced, while the filter is decomposed in a
# prefix, in the value of the `uid=&lt;arg&gt;' AVA, and 
# in a suffix. A tag `&lt;&gt;' is appended to the DN. 
# If the DN refers to an entry in the `ou=admin' subtree, 
# the filter is rewritten OR-ing the `uid=&lt;arg&gt;' with
# `cn=&lt;arg&gt;'; otherwise it is left as is. This could be
# useful, for instance, to allow apache's auth_ldap-1.4
# module to authenticate users with both `uid' and
# `cn', but only if the request comes from a possible
# `cn=Web auth,ou=admin,dc=home,dc=net' user.

The following directives map the object class `groupOfNames' to the object class
  `groupOfUniqueNames' and the attribute type `member' to the attribute type
  `uniqueMember':
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
map objectclass groupOfNames groupOfUniqueNames
map attribute uniqueMember member
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">This presents a limited attribute set from the foreign server:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
map attribute cn *
map attribute sn *
map attribute manager *
map attribute description *
map attribute *
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">These lines map cn, sn, manager, and description to themselves,
    and any other attribute gets &quot;removed&quot; from the object before it
    is sent to the client (or sent up to the LDAP server). This is obviously a
    simplistic example, but you get the point.</p>
