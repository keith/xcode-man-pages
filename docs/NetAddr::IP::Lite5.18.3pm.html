This module provides an object-oriented abstraction on top of IP addresses or IP
  subnets, that allows for easy manipulations. Most of the operations of
  NetAddr::IP are supported. This module will work with older versions of Perl
  and is compatible with Math::BigInt.
<p class="Pp">* By default <b>NetAddr::IP</b> functions and methods return
    string IPv6 addresses in uppercase. To change that to lowercase:</p>
<p class="Pp">NOTE: the AUGUST 2010 RFC5952 states:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    4.3. Lowercase

      The characters &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, and &quot;f&quot; in an IPv6
      address MUST be represented in lowercase.
</pre>
<p class="Pp">It is recommended that all NEW applications using
    NetAddr::IP::Lite be invoked as shown on the next line.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  use NetAddr::IP::Lite qw(:lower);

<p class="Pp">* To ensure the current IPv6 string case behavior even if the
    default changes:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  use NetAddr::IP::Lite qw(:upper);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The internal representation of all IP objects is in 128 bit IPv6
    notation. IPv4 and IPv6 objects may be freely mixed.</p>
<p class="Pp">The supported operations are described below:</p>

  <dd>Has been optimized to copy one NetAddr::IP::Lite object to another very
      quickly.</dd>
  <dt><b></b><b>&quot;-&gt;copy()&quot;</b><b></b></dt>
  <dd>The <b>assignment (</b><b>&quot;=&quot;</b><b>)</b> operation is only put

    <p class="Pp"><b></b><b>&quot;-&gt;copy()&quot;</b><b></b> actually creates
        a new object when called.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>Stringification</b></dt>
  <dd>An object can be used just as a string. For instance, the following code
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
        my $ip = new NetAddr::IP::Lite '192.168.1.123';

    <p class="Pp">Will print the string 0:0:0:0:0:0:C0A8:17B/128</p>

  <dt><b>Equality</b></dt>
  <dd>You can test for equality with either
      <span class="Li">&quot;eq&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;ne&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;==&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;!=&quot;</span>.
      <span class="Li">&quot;eq&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;ne&quot;</span> allows the comparison with
      arbitrary strings as well as NetAddr::IP::Lite objects. The following
      example:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    if (NetAddr::IP::Lite-&gt;new('127.0.0.1','255.0.0.0') eq '127.0.0.1/8')
       { print &quot;Yes\n&quot;; }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Will print out &quot;Yes&quot;.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Comparison with <span class="Li">&quot;==&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;!=&quot;</span> requires both operands to be
        NetAddr::IP::Lite objects.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>Comparison via &gt;, &lt;, &gt;=, &lt;=, &lt;=&gt; and
    </b><b>&quot;cmp&quot;</b><b></b></dt>
  <dd>Internally, all network objects are represented in 128 bit format. The
      numeric representation of the network is compared through the
      corresponding operation. Comparisons are tried first on the address
      portion of the object and if that is equal then the NUMERIC cidr portion
      of the masks are compared. This leads to the counterintuitive result that

    <pre>

    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Comparison should not be done on netaddr objects with
        different CIDR as this may produce indeterminate - unexpected results,
        rather the determination of which netblock is larger or smaller should
        be done by comparing</p>

  <dt><b>Addition of a constant (</b><b>&quot;+&quot;</b><b>)</b></dt>
  <dd>Add a 32 bit signed constant to the address part of a NetAddr object. This
      operation changes the address part to point so many hosts above the
      current objects start address. For instance, this code:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    print NetAddr::IP::Lite-&gt;new('127.0.0.1/8') + 5;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">will output 127.0.0.6/8. The address will wrap around at the
        broadcast back to the network address. This code:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    print NetAddr::IP::Lite-&gt;new('10.0.0.1/24') + 255;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">outputs 10.0.0.0/24.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Returns the the unchanged object when the constant is missing
        or out of range.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>

  <dd>The complement of the addition of a constant.</dd>
  <dt><b>Difference (</b><b>&quot;-&quot;</b><b>)</b></dt>
  <dd>Returns the difference between the address parts of two NetAddr::IP::Lite
      objects address parts as a 32 bit signed number.
    <p class="Pp">Returns <b>undef</b> if the difference is out of range.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>Auto-increment</b></dt>
  <dd>Auto-incrementing a NetAddr::IP::Lite object causes the address part to be

      Normally this is used to refer to a subnet.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;-&gt;addr()&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Returns a scalar with the address part of the object as an IPv4 or IPv6
      text string as appropriate. This is useful for printing or for passing the
      address part of the NetAddr::IP::Lite object to other components that
      expect an IP address. If the object is an ipV6 address or was created
      using -&gt;new6($ip) it will be reported in ipV6 hex format otherwise it
      will be reported in dot quad format only if it resides in ipV4 address
      space.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;-&gt;mask()&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Returns a scalar with the mask as an IPv4 or IPv6 text string as described
      above.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;-&gt;masklen()&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Returns a scalar the number of one bits in the mask.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;-&gt;bits()&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Returns the width of the address in bits. Normally 32 for v4 and 128 for
      v6.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;-&gt;version()&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Returns the version of the address or subnet. Currently this can be either
      4 or 6.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;-&gt;cidr()&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Returns a scalar with the address and mask in CIDR notation. A
      NetAddr::IP::Lite object <i>stringifies</i> to the result of this
      function. (see comments about -&gt;<i>new6()</i> and -&gt;<i>addr()</i>
      for output formats)</dd>
  <dt>&quot;-&gt;aton()&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Returns the address part of the NetAddr::IP::Lite object in the same
      format as the <span class="Li">&quot;inet_aton()&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;ipv6_aton&quot;</span> function respectively. If

      always be in ipV6 format, even for addresses in ipV4 address space.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;-&gt;range()&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Returns a scalar with the base address and the broadcast address separated
      by a dash and spaces. This is called range notation.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;-&gt;numeric()&quot;</dt>
  <dd>When called in a scalar context, will return a numeric representation of
      the address part of the IP address. When called in an array context, it
      returns a list of two elements. The first element is as described, the
      second element is the numeric representation of the netmask.
    <p class="Pp">This method is essential for serializing the representation of
        a subnet.</p>

  <dt>&quot;-&gt;bigint()&quot;</dt>
  <dd>When called in a scalar context, will return a Math::BigInt representation
      of the address part of the IP address. When called in an array contest, it
      returns a list of two elements. The first element is as described, the
      second element is the Math::BigInt representation of the netmask.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;$me-&gt;contains($other)&quot;</dt>

    <p class="Pp">Version 4.00 of NetAddr::IP and version 1.00 of

        <span class="Li">&quot;-&gt;num()&quot;</span> exactly as the
        documentation states. Previous versions behaved slightly differently and
        not in a consistent manner.</p>
    <p class="Pp">To use the old behavior for

    <p class="Pp">WARNING:</p>
    <p class="Pp">NetAddr::IP will calculate and return a numeric string for
        network ranges as large as 2**128. These values are TEXT strings and
        perl can treat them as integers for numeric calculations.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Perl on 32 bit platforms only handles integer numbers up to
        2**32 and on 64 bit platforms to 2**64.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you wish to manipulate numeric strings returned by
        NetAddr::IP that are larger than 2**32 or 2**64, respectively, you must
        load additional modules such as Math::BigInt, bignum or some similar
        package to do the integer math.</p>
