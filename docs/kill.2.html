<p class="Pp">The
    <a class="permalink" href="#kill"><code class="Fn" id="kill">kill</code></a>()
    function sends the signal specified by <var class="Fa">sig</var> to
    <var class="Fa">pid</var>, a process or a group of processes. Typically,
    <var class="Fa">Sig</var> will be one of the signals specified in
    <a class="Xr">sigaction(2)</a>. A value of 0, however, will cause error
    checking to be performed (with no signal being sent). This can be used to
    check the validity of <var class="Fa">pid</var>.</p>
<p class="Pp">For a process to have permission to send a signal to a process
    designated by <var class="Fa">pid</var>, the real or effective user ID of
    the receiving process must match that of the sending process or the user
    must have appropriate privileges (such as given by a set-user-ID program or
    the user is the super-user). A single exception is the signal SIGCONT, which
    may always be sent to any descendant of the current process.</p>

  <dd><var class="Fa">Sig</var> is sent to all processes whose group ID is equal

      permission; this is a variant of <a class="Xr">killpg(2)</a>.</dd>
  <dt>If <var class="Fa">pid</var> <span class="No">is -1</span>:</dt>
  <dd>If the user has super-user privileges, the signal is sent to all processes
      excluding system processes and the process sending the signal. If the user
      is not the super user, the signal is sent to all processes with the same
      uid as the user, excluding the process sending the signal. No error is
      returned if any process could be signaled.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">For compatibility with System V, if the process number is negative
    but not -1, the signal is sent to all processes whose process group ID is
    equal to the absolute value of the process number. This is a variant of
    <a class="Xr">killpg(2)</a>.</p>
