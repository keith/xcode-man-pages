<p class="Pp"><code class="Nm">sshd</code> (OpenSSH Daemon) is the daemon
    program for <a class="Xr">ssh(1)</a>. It provides secure encrypted
    communications between two untrusted hosts over an insecure network.</p>
<p class="Pp"><code class="Nm">sshd</code> listens for connections from clients.
    It is normally started at boot from <span class="Pa">/etc/rc</span>. It
    forks a new daemon for each incoming connection. The forked daemons handle
    key exchange, encryption, authentication, command execution, and data
    exchange.</p>
<p class="Pp"><code class="Nm">sshd</code> can be configured using command-line
    options or a configuration file (by default
    <a class="Xr">sshd_config(5)</a>); command-line options override values
    specified in the configuration file. <code class="Nm">sshd</code> rereads
    its configuration file when it receives a hangup signal,
    <code class="Dv">SIGHUP</code>, by executing itself with the name and
    options it was started with, e.g.
  <span class="Pa">/usr/sbin/sshd</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The options are as follows:</p>

      <code class="Cm">Match</code> directives in the configuration file that
      would apply are applied before the configuration is written to standard
      output. The connection parameters are supplied as keyword=value pairs and
      may be supplied in any order, either with multiple
      <code class="Fl">-C</code> options or as a comma-separated list. The
      keywords are &#x201C;addr&#x201D;, &#x201C;user&#x201D;,
      &#x201C;host&#x201D;, &#x201C;laddr&#x201D;, &#x201C;lport&#x201D;, and
      &#x201C;rdomain&#x201D; and correspond to source address, user, resolved
      source host name, local address, local port number and routing domain
      respectively. Additionally the &#x201C;invalid-user&#x201D; flag (which
      does not take a value argument) may be specified to simulate a connection
      from an unrecognised username.</dd>
  <dt id="c"><a class="permalink" href="#c"><code class="Fl">-c</code></a>
    <var class="Ar">host_certificate_file</var></dt>

  <dt id="d"><a class="permalink" href="#d"><code class="Fl">-d</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Debug mode. The server sends verbose debug output to standard error, and

      refuses to start if there is no configuration file.</dd>
  <dt id="G"><a class="permalink" href="#G"><code class="Fl">-G</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Parse and print configuration file. Check the validity of the

  <dt id="g"><a class="permalink" href="#g"><code class="Fl">-g</code></a>
    <var class="Ar">login_grace_time</var></dt>
  <dd>Gives the grace time for clients to authenticate themselves (default 120
      seconds). If the client fails to authenticate the user within this many
      seconds, the server disconnects and exits. A value of zero indicates no
      limit.</dd>
  <dt id="h"><a class="permalink" href="#h"><code class="Fl">-h</code></a>
    <var class="Ar">host_key_file</var></dt>
  <dd>Specifies a file from which a host key is read. This option must be given
      if <code class="Nm">sshd</code> is not run as root (as the normal host key
      files are normally not readable by anyone but root). The default is
      <span class="Pa">/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key</span>,
      <span class="Pa">/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key</span> and
      <span class="Pa">/etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key</span>. It is possible to have

  <dt id="o"><a class="permalink" href="#o"><code class="Fl">-o</code></a>
    <var class="Ar">option</var></dt>
  <dd>Can be used to give options in the format used in the configuration file.
      This is useful for specifying options for which there is no separate
      command-line flag. For full details of the options, and their values, see
      <a class="Xr">sshd_config(5)</a>.</dd>
  <dt id="p"><a class="permalink" href="#p"><code class="Fl">-p</code></a>
    <var class="Ar">port</var></dt>
  <dd>Specifies the port on which the server listens for connections (default
      22). Multiple port options are permitted. Ports specified in the
      configuration file with the <code class="Cm">Port</code> option are
      ignored when a command-line port is specified. Ports specified using the
      <code class="Cm">ListenAddress</code> option override command-line
    ports.</dd>
  <dt id="q"><a class="permalink" href="#q"><code class="Fl">-q</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Quiet mode. Nothing is sent to the system log. Normally the beginning,
      authentication, and termination of each connection is logged.</dd>
  <dt id="T"><a class="permalink" href="#T"><code class="Fl">-T</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Extended test mode. Check the validity of the configuration file, output
      the effective configuration to stdout and then exit. Optionally,
      <code class="Cm">Match</code> rules may be applied by specifying the
      connection parameters using one or more <code class="Fl">-C</code>
      options. This is similar to the <code class="Fl">-G</code> flag, but it
      includes the additional testing performed by the
      <code class="Fl">-t</code> flag.</dd>
  <dt id="t"><a class="permalink" href="#t"><code class="Fl">-t</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Test mode. Only check the validity of the configuration file and sanity of
      the keys. This is useful for updating <code class="Nm">sshd</code>
      reliably as configuration options may change.</dd>
  <dt id="u"><a class="permalink" href="#u"><code class="Fl">-u</code></a>
    <var class="Ar">len</var></dt>
  <dd>This option is used to specify the size of the field in the
      <var class="Vt">utmp</var> structure that holds the remote host name. If
      the resolved host name is longer than <var class="Ar">len</var>, the
      dotted decimal value will be used instead. This allows hosts with very
      long host names that overflow this field to still be uniquely identified.
      Specifying <code class="Fl">-u0</code> indicates that only dotted decimal
      addresses should be put into the <span class="Pa">utmp</span> file.
      <code class="Fl">-u0</code> may also be used to prevent
      <code class="Nm">sshd</code> from making DNS requests unless the
      authentication mechanism or configuration requires it. Authentication
      mechanisms that may require DNS include
      <code class="Cm">HostbasedAuthentication</code> and using a
      <code class="Cm">from=&quot;pattern-list&quot;</code> option in a key
      file. Configuration options that require DNS include using a USER@HOST
      pattern in <code class="Cm">AllowUsers</code> or
      <code class="Cm">DenyUsers</code>.</dd>

<h1 class="Sh" id="AUTHENTICATION"><a class="permalink" href="#AUTHENTICATION">AUTHENTICATION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The OpenSSH SSH daemon supports SSH protocol 2 only. Each host has
    a host-specific key, used to identify the host. Whenever a client connects,
    the daemon responds with its public host key. The client compares the host
    key against its own database to verify that it has not changed. Forward
    secrecy is provided through a Diffie-Hellman key agreement. This key
    agreement results in a shared session key. The rest of the session is
    encrypted using a symmetric cipher. The client selects the encryption
    algorithm to use from those offered by the server. Additionally, session
    integrity is provided through a cryptographic message authentication code
    (MAC).</p>
<p class="Pp">Finally, the server and the client enter an authentication dialog.
    The client tries to authenticate itself using host-based authentication,
    public key authentication, challenge-response authentication, or password
    authentication.</p>
<p class="Pp">Regardless of the authentication type, the account is checked to
    ensure that it is accessible. An account is not accessible if it is locked,
    listed in <code class="Cm">DenyUsers</code> or its group is listed in
    <code class="Cm">DenyGroups</code> . The definition of a locked account is
    system dependent. Some platforms have their own account database (eg AIX)
    and some modify the passwd field (
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">*LK*</code>&#x2019; on Solaris and UnixWare,
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">*</code>&#x2019; on HP-UX, containing
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">Nologin</code>&#x2019; on Tru64, a leading
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">*LOCKED*</code>&#x2019; on FreeBSD and a leading
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">!</code>&#x2019; on most Linuxes). If there is a
    requirement to disable password authentication for the account while
    allowing still public-key, then the passwd field should be set to something
    other than these values (eg &#x2018;<code class="Li">NP</code>&#x2019; or
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">*NP*</code>&#x2019; ).</p>
<p class="Pp">If the client successfully authenticates itself, a dialog for
    preparing the session is entered. At this time the client may request things
    like allocating a pseudo-tty, forwarding X11 connections, forwarding TCP
    connections, or forwarding the authentication agent connection over the
    secure channel.</p>
<p class="Pp">After this, the client either requests an interactive shell or
    execution of a non-interactive command, which <code class="Nm">sshd</code>
    will execute via the user's shell using its <code class="Fl">-c</code>
    option. The sides then enter session mode. In this mode, either side may
    send data at any time, and such data is forwarded to/from the shell or
    command on the server side, and the user terminal in the client side.</p>
<p class="Pp">When the user program terminates and all forwarded X11 and other
    connections have been closed, the server sends command exit status to the
    client, and both sides exit.</p>

  <li>If the login is on a tty, records login time.</li>

  <li>Changes to run with normal user privileges.</li>
  <li>Sets up basic environment.</li>
  <li>Reads the file <span class="Pa">~/.ssh/environment</span>, if it exists,
      and users are allowed to change their environment. See the

  <dd>Specifies that the command is executed whenever this key is used for
      authentication. The command supplied by the user (if any) is ignored. The
      command is run on a pty if the client requests a pty; otherwise it is run
      without a tty. If an 8-bit clean channel is required, one must not request
      a pty or should specify <code class="Cm">no-pty</code>. A quote may be
      included in the command by quoting it with a backslash.
    <p class="Pp">This option might be useful to restrict certain public keys to
        perform just a specific operation. An example might be a key that

    <p class="Pp">The purpose of this option is to optionally increase security:
        public key authentication by itself does not trust the network or name
        servers or anything (but the key); however, if somebody somehow steals
        the key, the key permits an intruder to log in from anywhere in the
        world. This additional option makes using a stolen key more difficult

<h1 class="Sh" id="SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS_FILE_FORMAT"><a class="permalink" href="#SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS_FILE_FORMAT">SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS
  FILE FORMAT</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Pa">/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts</span> and
    <span class="Pa">~/.ssh/known_hosts</span> files contain host public keys
    for all known hosts. The global file should be prepared by the administrator
    (optional), and the per-user file is maintained automatically: whenever the
    user connects to an unknown host, its key is added to the per-user file.</p>
<p class="Pp">Each line in these files contains the following fields: marker
    (optional), hostnames, keytype, base64-encoded key, comment. The fields are
    separated by spaces.</p>
<p class="Pp">The marker is optional, but if it is present then it must be one
    of &#x201C;@cert-authority&#x201D;, to indicate that the line contains a
    certification authority (CA) key, or &#x201C;@revoked&#x201D;, to indicate
    that the key contained on the line is revoked and must not ever be accepted.
    Only one marker should be used on a key line.</p>
<p class="Pp">Hostnames is a comma-separated list of patterns
    (&#x2018;<code class="Li">*</code>&#x2019; and
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">?</code>&#x2019; act as wildcards); each pattern in
    turn is matched against the host name. When <code class="Nm">sshd</code> is
    authenticating a client, such as when using
    <code class="Cm">HostbasedAuthentication</code>, this will be the canonical
    client host name. When <a class="Xr">ssh(1)</a> is authenticating a server,
    this will be the host name given by the user, the value of the
    <a class="Xr">ssh(1)</a> <code class="Cm">HostkeyAlias</code> if it was
    specified, or the canonical server hostname if the <a class="Xr">ssh(1)</a>
    <code class="Cm">CanonicalizeHostname</code> option was used.</p>
<p class="Pp">A pattern may also be preceded by
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">!</code>&#x2019; to indicate negation: if the host
    name matches a negated pattern, it is not accepted (by that line) even if it
    matched another pattern on the line. A hostname or address may optionally be
    enclosed within &#x2018;<code class="Li">[</code>&#x2019; and
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">]</code>&#x2019; brackets then followed by
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">:</code>&#x2019; and a non-standard port
  number.</p>
<p class="Pp">Alternately, hostnames may be stored in a hashed form which hides
    host names and addresses should the file's contents be disclosed. Hashed
    hostnames start with a &#x2018;<code class="Li">|</code>&#x2019; character.
    Only one hashed hostname may appear on a single line and none of the above
    negation or wildcard operators may be applied.</p>
<p class="Pp">The keytype and base64-encoded key are taken directly from the
    host key; they can be obtained, for example, from
    <span class="Pa">/etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub</span>. The optional comment
    field continues to the end of the line, and is not used.</p>
<p class="Pp">Lines starting with &#x2018;<code class="Li">#</code>&#x2019; and
    empty lines are ignored as comments.</p>
<p class="Pp">When performing host authentication, authentication is accepted if
    any matching line has the proper key; either one that matches exactly or, if
    the server has presented a certificate for authentication, the key of the
    certification authority that signed the certificate. For a key to be trusted
    as a certification authority, it must use the
    &#x201C;@cert-authority&#x201D; marker described above.</p>
<p class="Pp">The known hosts file also provides a facility to mark keys as
    revoked, for example when it is known that the associated private key has
    been stolen. Revoked keys are specified by including the
    &#x201C;@revoked&#x201D; marker at the beginning of the key line, and are
    never accepted for authentication or as certification authorities, but
    instead will produce a warning from <a class="Xr">ssh(1)</a> when they are
    encountered.</p>
<p class="Pp">It is permissible (but not recommended) to have several lines or
    different host keys for the same names. This will inevitably happen when
    short forms of host names from different domains are put in the file. It is
    possible that the files contain conflicting information; authentication is
    accepted if valid information can be found from either file.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that the lines in these files are typically hundreds of
    characters long, and you definitely don't want to type in the host keys by
    hand. Rather, generate them by a script, <a class="Xr">ssh-keyscan(1)</a> or
    by taking, for example,
    <span class="Pa">/etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub</span> and adding the host
    names at the front. <a class="Xr">ssh-keygen(1)</a> also offers some basic
    automated editing for <span class="Pa">~/.ssh/known_hosts</span> including
    removing hosts matching a host name and converting all host names to their
    hashed representations.</p>
<p class="Pp">An example ssh_known_hosts file:</p>
<div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent Li">
