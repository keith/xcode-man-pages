   Set up some character translations and predefined strings.  \*(-- will
   give an unbreakable dash, \*(PI will give pi, \*(L" will give a left
   double quote, and \*(R" will give a right double quote.  \*(C+ will
   give a nicer C++.  Capital omega is used to do unbreakable dashes and
   therefore won't be available.  \*(C` and \*(C' expand to `' in nroff,
   nothing in troff, for use with C<>.

These messages are classified as follows (listed in increasing order of
  desperation):
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    (W) A warning (optional).
    (D) A deprecation (enabled by default).
    (S) A severe warning (enabled by default).
    (F) A fatal error (trappable).
    (P) An internal error you should never see (trappable).
    (X) A very fatal error (nontrappable).
    (A) An alien error message (not generated by Perl).
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The majority of messages from the first three classifications
    above (W, D &amp; S) can be controlled using the
    <span class="Li">&quot;warnings&quot;</span> pragma.</p>
<p class="Pp">If a message can be controlled by the
    <span class="Li">&quot;warnings&quot;</span> pragma, its warning category is
    included with the classification letter in the description below. E.g.
    <span class="Li">&quot;(W closed)&quot;</span> means a warning in the
    <span class="Li">&quot;closed&quot;</span> category.</p>
<p class="Pp">Optional warnings are enabled by using the
    <span class="Li">&quot;warnings&quot;</span> pragma or the <b>-w</b> and
    <b>-W</b> switches. Warnings may be captured by setting
    <span class="Li">$SIG{__WARN__}</span> to a reference to a routine that will
    be called on each warning instead of printing it. See perlvar.</p>
<p class="Pp">Severe warnings are always enabled, unless they are explicitly
    disabled with the <span class="Li">&quot;warnings&quot;</span> pragma or the
    <b>-X</b> switch.</p>
<p class="Pp">Trappable errors may be trapped using the eval operator. See
    &quot;eval&quot; in perlfunc. In almost all cases, warnings may be
    selectively disabled or promoted to fatal errors using the
    <span class="Li">&quot;warnings&quot;</span> pragma. See warnings.</p>
<p class="Pp">The messages are in alphabetical order, without regard to upper or
    lower-case. Some of these messages are generic. Spots that vary are denoted
    with a <span class="Li">%s</span> or other printf-style escape. These
    escapes are ignored by the alphabetical order, as are all characters other
    than letters. To look up your message, just ignore anything that is not a
    letter.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>accept()</b> on closed socket %s</dt>
  <dd>(W closed) You tried to do an accept on a closed socket. Did you forget to
      check the return value of your <b>socket()</b> call? See
      &quot;accept&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt>Aliasing via reference is experimental</dt>
  <dd>(S experimental::refaliasing) This warning is emitted if you use a
      reference constructor on the left-hand side of an assignment to alias one
      variable to another. Simply suppress the warning if you want to use the
      feature, but know that in doing so you are taking the risk of using an
      experimental feature which may change or be removed in a future Perl
      version:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    no warnings &quot;experimental::refaliasing&quot;;
    use feature &quot;refaliasing&quot;;
    \$x = \$y;
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>Allocation too large: %x</dt>
  <dd>(X) You can't allocate more than 64K on an MS-DOS machine.</dd>
  <dt>'%c' allowed only after types %s in %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) The modifiers '!', '&lt;' and '&gt;' are allowed in <b>pack()</b> or
      <b>unpack()</b> only after certain types. See &quot;pack&quot; in
      perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt>alpha-&gt;<b>numify()</b> is lossy</dt>
  <dd>(W numeric) An alpha version can not be numified without losing
      information.</dd>
  <dt>Ambiguous call resolved as CORE::%s(), qualify as such or use &amp;</dt>
  <dd>(W ambiguous) A subroutine you have declared has the same name as a Perl
      keyword, and you have used the name without qualification for calling one
      or the other. Perl decided to call the builtin because the subroutine is
      not imported.
    <p class="Pp">To force interpretation as a subroutine call, either put an
        ampersand before the subroutine name, or qualify the name with its
        package. Alternatively, you can import the subroutine (or pretend that
        it's imported with the <span class="Li">&quot;use subs&quot;</span>
        pragma).</p>
    <p class="Pp">To silently interpret it as the Perl operator, use the
        <span class="Li">&quot;CORE::&quot;</span> prefix on the operator (e.g.
        <span class="Li">&quot;CORE::log($x)&quot;</span>) or declare the
        subroutine to be an object method (see &quot;Subroutine Attributes&quot;
        in perlsub or attributes).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Ambiguous range in transliteration operator</dt>
  <dd>(F) You wrote something like
      <span class="Li">&quot;tr/a-z-0//&quot;</span> which doesn't mean anything
      at all. To include a <span class="Li">&quot;-&quot;</span> character in a
      transliteration, put it either first or last. (In the past,
      <span class="Li">&quot;tr/a-z-0//&quot;</span> was synonymous with
      <span class="Li">&quot;tr/a-y//&quot;</span>, which was probably not what
      you would have expected.)</dd>
  <dt>Ambiguous use of %s resolved as %s</dt>
  <dd>(S ambiguous) You said something that may not be interpreted the way you
      thought. Normally it's pretty easy to disambiguate it by supplying a
      missing quote, operator, parenthesis pair or declaration.</dd>
  <dt>Ambiguous use of -%s resolved as -&amp;%s()</dt>
  <dd>(S ambiguous) You wrote something like
      <span class="Li">&quot;-foo&quot;</span>, which might be the string
      <span class="Li">&quot;-foo&quot;</span>, or a call to the function
      <span class="Li">&quot;foo&quot;</span>, negated. If you meant the string,
      just write <span class="Li">&quot;-foo&quot;</span>. If you meant the
      function call, write <span class="Li">&quot;-foo()&quot;</span>.</dd>
  <dt>Ambiguous use of %c resolved as operator %c</dt>
  <dd>(S ambiguous) <span class="Li">&quot;%&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;&amp;&quot;</span>, and
      <span class="Li">&quot;*&quot;</span> are both infix operators (modulus,
      bitwise and, and multiplication) <i>and</i> initial special characters
      (denoting hashes, subroutines and typeglobs), and you said something like
      <span class="Li">&quot;*foo * foo&quot;</span> that might be interpreted
      as either of them. We assumed you meant the infix operator, but please try
      to make it more clear -- in the example given, you might write
      <span class="Li">&quot;*foo * foo()&quot;</span> if you really meant to
      multiply a glob by the result of calling a function.</dd>
  <dt>Ambiguous use of %c{%s} resolved to %c%s</dt>
  <dd>(W ambiguous) You wrote something like
      <span class="Li">&quot;@{foo}&quot;</span>, which might be asking for the
      variable <span class="Li">@foo</span>, or it might be calling a function
      named foo, and dereferencing it as an array reference. If you wanted the
      variable, you can just write <span class="Li">@foo</span>. If you wanted
      to call the function, write <span class="Li">&quot;@{foo()}&quot;</span>
      ... or you could just not have a variable and a function with the same
      name, and save yourself a lot of trouble.</dd>
  <dt>Ambiguous use of %c{%s[...]} resolved to %c%s[...]</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>Ambiguous use of %c{%s{...}} resolved to %c%s{...}</dt>
  <dd>(W ambiguous) You wrote something like
      <span class="Li">&quot;${foo[2]}&quot;</span> (where foo represents the
      name of a Perl keyword), which might be looking for element number 2 of
      the array named <span class="Li">@foo</span>, in which case please write
      <span class="Li">$foo[2]</span>, or you might have meant to pass an
      anonymous arrayref to the function named foo, and then do a scalar deref
      on the value it returns. If you meant that, write
      <span class="Li">&quot;${foo([2])}&quot;</span>.
    <p class="Pp">In regular expressions, the
        <span class="Li">&quot;${foo[2]}&quot;</span> syntax is sometimes
        necessary to disambiguate between array subscripts and character
        classes. <span class="Li">&quot;/$length[2345]/&quot;</span>, for
        instance, will be interpreted as <span class="Li">$length</span>
        followed by the character class
        <span class="Li">&quot;[2345]&quot;</span>. If an array subscript is
        what you want, you can avoid the warning by changing
        <span class="Li">&quot;/${length[2345]}/&quot;</span> to the unsightly
        <span class="Li">&quot;/${\$length[2345]}/&quot;</span>, by renaming
        your array to something that does not coincide with a built-in keyword,
        or by simply turning off warnings with <span class="Li">&quot;no
        warnings 'ambiguous';&quot;</span>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>'|' and '&lt;' may not both be specified on command line</dt>
  <dd>(F) An error peculiar to VMS. Perl does its own command line redirection,
      and found that STDIN was a pipe, and that you also tried to redirect STDIN
      using '&lt;'. Only one STDIN stream to a customer, please.</dd>
  <dt>'|' and '&gt;' may not both be specified on command line</dt>
  <dd>(F) An error peculiar to VMS. Perl does its own command line redirection,
      and thinks you tried to redirect stdout both to a file and into a pipe to
      another command. You need to choose one or the other, though nothing's
      stopping you from piping into a program or Perl script which 'splits'
      output into two streams, such as
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    open(OUT,&quot;&gt;$ARGV[0]&quot;) or die &quot;Can't write to $ARGV[0]: $!&quot;;
    while (&lt;STDIN&gt;) {
        print;
        print OUT;
    }
    close OUT;
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>Applying %s to %s will act on scalar(%s)</dt>
  <dd>(W misc) The pattern match (<span class="Li">&quot;//&quot;</span>),
      substitution (<span class="Li">&quot;s///&quot;</span>), and
      transliteration (<span class="Li">&quot;tr///&quot;</span>) operators work
      on scalar values. If you apply one of them to an array or a hash, it will
      convert the array or hash to a scalar value (the length of an array, or
      the population info of a hash) and then work on that scalar value. This is
      probably not what you meant to do. See &quot;grep&quot; in perlfunc and
      &quot;map&quot; in perlfunc for alternatives.</dd>
  <dt>Arg too short for msgsnd</dt>
  <dd>(F) <b>msgsnd()</b> requires a string at least as long as
    sizeof(long).</dd>
  <dt>Argument &quot;%s&quot; isn't numeric%s</dt>
  <dd>(W numeric) The indicated string was fed as an argument to an operator
      that expected a numeric value instead. If you're fortunate the message
      will identify which operator was so unfortunate.
    <p class="Pp">Note that for the <span class="Li">&quot;Inf&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;NaN&quot;</span> (infinity and not-a-number) the
        definition of &quot;numeric&quot; is somewhat unusual: the strings
        themselves (like &quot;Inf&quot;) are considered numeric, and anything
        following them is considered non-numeric.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Argument list not closed for PerlIO layer &quot;%s&quot;</dt>
  <dd>(W layer) When pushing a layer with arguments onto the Perl I/O system you
      forgot the ) that closes the argument list. (Layers take care of
      transforming data between external and internal representations.) Perl
      stopped parsing the layer list at this point and did not attempt to push
      this layer. If your program didn't explicitly request the failing
      operation, it may be the result of the value of the environment variable
      PERLIO.</dd>
  <dt>Argument &quot;%s&quot; treated as 0 in increment (++)</dt>
  <dd>(W numeric) The indicated string was fed as an argument to the
      <span class="Li">&quot;++&quot;</span> operator which expects either a
      number or a string matching
      <span class="Li">&quot;/^[a-zA-Z]*[0-9]*\z/&quot;</span>. See
      &quot;Auto-increment and Auto-decrement&quot; in perlop for details.</dd>
  <dt>Array passed to stat will be coerced to a scalar%s</dt>
  <dd>(W syntax) You called <b>stat()</b> on an array, but the array will be
      coerced to a scalar - the number of elements in the array.</dd>
  <dt>A signature parameter must start with '$', '@' or '%'</dt>
  <dd>(F) Each subroutine signature parameter declaration must start with a
      valid sigil; for example:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    sub foo ($a, $, $b = 1, @c) {}
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>A slurpy parameter may not have a default value</dt>
  <dd>(F) Only scalar subroutine signature parameters may have a default value;
      for example:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    sub foo ($a = 1)        {} # legal
    sub foo (@a = (1))      {} # invalid
    sub foo (%a = (a =&gt; b)) {} # invalid
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>assertion botched: %s</dt>
  <dd>(X) The malloc package that comes with Perl had an internal failure.</dd>
  <dt>Assertion %s failed: file &quot;%s&quot;, line %d</dt>
  <dd>(X) A general assertion failed. The file in question must be
    examined.</dd>
  <dt>Assigned value is not a reference</dt>
  <dd>(F) You tried to assign something that was not a reference to an lvalue
      reference (e.g., <span class="Li">&quot;\$x = $y&quot;</span>). If you
      meant to make <span class="Li">$x</span> an alias to
      <span class="Li">$y</span>, use <span class="Li">&quot;\$x =
      \$y&quot;</span>.</dd>
  <dt>Assigned value is not %s reference</dt>
  <dd>(F) You tried to assign a reference to a reference constructor, but the
      two references were not of the same type. You cannot alias a scalar to an
      array, or an array to a hash; the two types must match.
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    \$x = \@y;  # error
    \@x = \%y;  # error
     $y = [];
    \$x = $y;   # error; did you mean \$y?
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>Assigning non-zero to $[ is no longer possible</dt>
  <dd>(F) When the &quot;array_base&quot; feature is disabled (e.g., under
      <span class="Li">&quot;use v5.16;&quot;</span>) the special variable
      <span class="Li">$[</span>, which is deprecated, is now a fixed zero
      value.</dd>
  <dt>Assignment to both a list and a scalar</dt>
  <dd>(F) If you assign to a conditional operator, the 2nd and 3rd arguments
      must either both be scalars or both be lists. Otherwise Perl won't know
      which context to supply to the right side.</dd>
  <dt>Assuming NOT a POSIX class since %s in regex; marked by &lt;--&#x00A0;HERE
    in m/%s/</dt>
  <dd>(W regexp) You had something like these:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
 [[:alnum]]
 [[:digit:xyz]
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">They look like they might have been meant to be the POSIX
        classes <span class="Li">&quot;[:alnum:]&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;[:digit:]&quot;</span>. If so, they should be
        written:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
 [[:alnum:]]
 [[:digit:]xyz]
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Since these aren't legal POSIX class specifications, but are
        legal bracketed character classes, Perl treats them as the latter. In
        the first example, it matches the characters
        <span class="Li">&quot;:&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;[&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;a&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;l&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;m&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;n&quot;</span>, and
        <span class="Li">&quot;u&quot;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If these weren't meant to be POSIX classes, this warning
        message is spurious, and can be suppressed by reordering things, such
      as</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
 [[al:num]]
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">or</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
 [[:munla]]
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>&lt;&gt; at require-statement should be quotes</dt>
  <dd>(F) You wrote <span class="Li">&quot;require &lt;file&gt;&quot;</span>
      when you should have written <span class="Li">&quot;require
      'file'&quot;</span>.</dd>
  <dt>Attempt to access disallowed key '%s' in a restricted hash</dt>
  <dd>(F) The failing code has attempted to get or set a key which is not in the
      current set of allowed keys of a restricted hash.</dd>
  <dt>Attempt to bless into a freed package</dt>
  <dd>(F) You wrote <span class="Li">&quot;bless $foo&quot;</span> with one
      argument after somehow causing the current package to be freed. Perl
      cannot figure out what to do, so it throws up its hands in despair.</dd>
  <dt>Attempt to bless into a reference</dt>
  <dd>(F) The CLASSNAME argument to the <b>bless()</b> operator is expected to
      be the name of the package to bless the resulting object into. You've
      supplied instead a reference to something: perhaps you wrote
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    bless $self, $proto;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">when you intended</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    bless $self, ref($proto) || $proto;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If you actually want to bless into the stringified version of
        the reference supplied, you need to stringify it yourself, for example
        by:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    bless $self, &quot;$proto&quot;;
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>Attempt to clear deleted array</dt>
  <dd>(S debugging) An array was assigned to when it was being freed. Freed
      values are not supposed to be visible to Perl code. This can also happen
      if XS code calls <span class="Li">&quot;av_clear&quot;</span> from a
      custom magic callback on the array.</dd>
  <dt>Attempt to delete disallowed key '%s' from a restricted hash</dt>
  <dd>(F) The failing code attempted to delete from a restricted hash a key
      which is not in its key set.</dd>
  <dt>Attempt to delete readonly key '%s' from a restricted hash</dt>
  <dd>(F) The failing code attempted to delete a key whose value has been
      declared readonly from a restricted hash.</dd>
  <dt>Attempt to free non-arena SV: 0x%x</dt>
  <dd>(S internal) All SV objects are supposed to be allocated from arenas that
      will be garbage collected on exit. An SV was discovered to be outside any
      of those arenas.</dd>
  <dt>Attempt to free nonexistent shared string '%s'%s</dt>
  <dd>(S internal) Perl maintains a reference-counted internal table of strings
      to optimize the storage and access of hash keys and other strings. This
      indicates someone tried to decrement the reference count of a string that
      can no longer be found in the table.</dd>
  <dt>Attempt to free temp prematurely: SV 0x%x</dt>
  <dd>(S debugging) Mortalized values are supposed to be freed by the
      <b>free_tmps()</b> routine. This indicates that something else is freeing
      the SV before the <b>free_tmps()</b> routine gets a chance, which means
      that the <b>free_tmps()</b> routine will be freeing an unreferenced scalar
      when it does try to free it.</dd>
  <dt>Attempt to free unreferenced glob pointers</dt>
  <dd>(S internal) The reference counts got screwed up on symbol aliases.</dd>
  <dt>Attempt to free unreferenced scalar: SV 0x%x</dt>
  <dd>(S internal) Perl went to decrement the reference count of a scalar to see
      if it would go to 0, and discovered that it had already gone to 0 earlier,
      and should have been freed, and in fact, probably was freed. This could
      indicate that <b>SvREFCNT_dec()</b> was called too many times, or that
      <b>SvREFCNT_inc()</b> was called too few times, or that the SV was
      mortalized when it shouldn't have been, or that memory has been
    corrupted.</dd>
  <dt>Attempt to pack pointer to temporary value</dt>
  <dd>(W pack) You tried to pass a temporary value (like the result of a
      function, or a computed expression) to the &quot;p&quot; <b>pack()</b>
      template. This means the result contains a pointer to a location that
      could become invalid anytime, even before the end of the current
      statement. Use literals or global values as arguments to the &quot;p&quot;
      <b>pack()</b> template to avoid this warning.</dd>
  <dt>Attempt to reload %s aborted.</dt>
  <dd>(F) You tried to load a file with <span class="Li">&quot;use&quot;</span>
      or <span class="Li">&quot;require&quot;</span> that failed to compile once
      already. Perl will not try to compile this file again unless you delete
      its entry from <span class="Li">%INC</span>. See &quot;require&quot; in
      perlfunc and &quot;%INC&quot; in perlvar.</dd>
  <dt>Attempt to set length of freed array</dt>
  <dd>(W misc) You tried to set the length of an array which has been freed. You
      can do this by storing a reference to the scalar representing the last
      index of an array and later assigning through that reference. For example
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    $r = do {my @a; \$#a};
    $$r = 503
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>Attempt to use reference as lvalue in substr</dt>
  <dd>(W substr) You supplied a reference as the first argument to
      <b>substr()</b> used as an lvalue, which is pretty strange. Perhaps you
      forgot to dereference it first. See &quot;substr&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt>Attribute prototype(%s) discards earlier prototype attribute in same
    sub</dt>
  <dd>(W misc) A sub was declared as sub foo : prototype(A) : prototype(B) {},
      for example. Since each sub can only have one prototype, the earlier
      declaration(s) are discarded while the last one is applied.</dd>
  <dt>av_reify called on tied array</dt>
  <dd>(S debugging) This indicates that something went wrong and Perl got
      <i>very</i> confused about <span class="Li">@_</span> or
      <span class="Li">@DB::args</span> being tied.</dd>
  <dt>Bad arg length for %s, is %u, should be %d</dt>
  <dd>(F) You passed a buffer of the wrong size to one of <b>msgctl()</b>,
      <b>semctl()</b> or <b>shmctl()</b>. In C parlance, the correct sizes are,
      respectively, sizeof(struct&#x00A0;msqid_ds&#x00A0;*),
      sizeof(struct&#x00A0;semid_ds&#x00A0;*), and
      sizeof(struct&#x00A0;shmid_ds&#x00A0;*).</dd>
  <dt>Bad evalled substitution pattern</dt>
  <dd>(F) You've used the <span class="Li">&quot;/e&quot;</span> switch to
      evaluate the replacement for a substitution, but perl found a syntax error
      in the code to evaluate, most likely an unexpected right brace '}'.</dd>
  <dt>Bad filehandle: %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) A symbol was passed to something wanting a filehandle, but the symbol
      has no filehandle associated with it. Perhaps you didn't do an
      <b>open()</b>, or did it in another package.</dd>
  <dt>Bad <b>free()</b> ignored</dt>
  <dd>(S malloc) An internal routine called <b>free()</b> on something that had
      never been <b>malloc()</b>ed in the first place. Mandatory, but can be
      disabled by setting environment variable
      <span class="Li">&quot;PERL_BADFREE&quot;</span> to 0.
    <p class="Pp">This message can be seen quite often with DB_File on systems
        with &quot;hard&quot; dynamic linking, like
        <span class="Li">&quot;AIX&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;OS/2&quot;</span>. It is a bug of
        <span class="Li">&quot;Berkeley DB&quot;</span> which is left unnoticed
        if <span class="Li">&quot;DB&quot;</span> uses <i>forgiving</i> system
        <b>malloc()</b>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Bad hash</dt>
  <dd>(P) One of the internal hash routines was passed a null HV pointer.</dd>
  <dt>Badly placed ()'s</dt>
  <dd>(A) You've accidentally run your script through <b>csh</b> instead of
      Perl. Check the #! line, or manually feed your script into Perl
    yourself.</dd>
  <dt>Bad name after %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) You started to name a symbol by using a package prefix, and then
      didn't finish the symbol. In particular, you can't interpolate outside of
      quotes, so
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    $var = 'myvar';
    $sym = mypack::$var;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">is not the same as</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    $var = 'myvar';
    $sym = &quot;mypack::$var&quot;;
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>Bad plugin affecting keyword '%s'</dt>
  <dd>(F) An extension using the keyword plugin mechanism violated the plugin
      API.</dd>
  <dt>Bad <b>realloc()</b> ignored</dt>
  <dd>(S malloc) An internal routine called <b>realloc()</b> on something that
      had never been <b>malloc()</b>ed in the first place. Mandatory, but can be
      disabled by setting the environment variable
      <span class="Li">&quot;PERL_BADFREE&quot;</span> to 1.</dd>
  <dt>Bad symbol for array</dt>
  <dd>(P) An internal request asked to add an array entry to something that
      wasn't a symbol table entry.</dd>
  <dt>Bad symbol for dirhandle</dt>
  <dd>(P) An internal request asked to add a dirhandle entry to something that
      wasn't a symbol table entry.</dd>
  <dt>Bad symbol for filehandle</dt>
  <dd>(P) An internal request asked to add a filehandle entry to something that
      wasn't a symbol table entry.</dd>
  <dt>Bad symbol for hash</dt>
  <dd>(P) An internal request asked to add a hash entry to something that wasn't
      a symbol table entry.</dd>
  <dt>Bad symbol for scalar</dt>
  <dd>(P) An internal request asked to add a scalar entry to something that
      wasn't a symbol table entry.</dd>
  <dt>Bareword found in conditional</dt>
  <dd>(W bareword) The compiler found a bareword where it expected a
      conditional, which often indicates that an || or &amp;&amp; was parsed as
      part of the last argument of the previous construct, for example:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    open FOO || die;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">It may also indicate a misspelled constant that has been
        interpreted as a bareword:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    use constant TYPO =&gt; 1;
    if (TYOP) { print &quot;foo&quot; }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;strict&quot;</span> pragma is
        useful in avoiding such errors.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Bareword in require contains &quot;%s&quot;</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>Bareword in require maps to disallowed filename &quot;%s&quot;</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>Bareword in require maps to empty filename</dt>
  <dd>(F) The bareword form of require has been invoked with a filename which
      could not have been generated by a valid bareword permitted by the parser.
      You shouldn't be able to get this error from Perl code, but XS code may
      throw it if it passes an invalid module name to
      <span class="Li">&quot;Perl_load_module&quot;</span>.</dd>
  <dt>Bareword in require must not start with a double-colon:
    &quot;%s&quot;</dt>
  <dd>(F) In <span class="Li">&quot;require Bare::Word&quot;</span>, the
      bareword is not allowed to start with a double-colon. Write
      <span class="Li">&quot;require ::Foo::Bar&quot;</span> as
      <span class="Li">&quot;require Foo::Bar&quot;</span> instead.</dd>
  <dt>Bareword &quot;%s&quot; not allowed while &quot;strict subs&quot; in
    use</dt>
  <dd>(F) With &quot;strict subs&quot; in use, a bareword is only allowed as a
      subroutine identifier, in curly brackets or to the left of the
      &quot;=&gt;&quot; symbol. Perhaps you need to predeclare a
    subroutine?</dd>
  <dt>Bareword &quot;%s&quot; refers to nonexistent package</dt>
  <dd>(W bareword) You used a qualified bareword of the form
      <span class="Li">&quot;Foo::&quot;</span>, but the compiler saw no other
      uses of that namespace before that point. Perhaps you need to predeclare a
      package?</dd>
  <dt>BEGIN failed--compilation aborted</dt>
  <dd>(F) An untrapped exception was raised while executing a BEGIN subroutine.
      Compilation stops immediately and the interpreter is exited.</dd>
  <dt>BEGIN not safe after errors--compilation aborted</dt>
  <dd>(F) Perl found a <span class="Li">&quot;BEGIN {}&quot;</span> subroutine
      (or a <span class="Li">&quot;use&quot;</span> directive, which implies a
      <span class="Li">&quot;BEGIN {}&quot;</span>) after one or more
      compilation errors had already occurred. Since the intended environment
      for the <span class="Li">&quot;BEGIN {}&quot;</span> could not be
      guaranteed (due to the errors), and since subsequent code likely depends
      on its correct operation, Perl just gave up.</dd>
  <dt>\%d better written as $%d</dt>
  <dd>(W syntax) Outside of patterns, backreferences live on as variables. The
      use of backslashes is grandfathered on the right-hand side of a
      substitution, but stylistically it's better to use the variable form
      because other Perl programmers will expect it, and it works better if
      there are more than 9 backreferences.</dd>
  <dt>Binary number &gt; 0b11111111111111111111111111111111 non-portable</dt>
  <dd>(W portable) The binary number you specified is larger than 2**32-1
      (4294967295) and therefore non-portable between systems. See perlport for
      more on portability concerns.</dd>
  <dt><b>bind()</b> on closed socket %s</dt>
  <dd>(W closed) You tried to do a bind on a closed socket. Did you forget to
      check the return value of your <b>socket()</b> call? See &quot;bind&quot;
      in perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt><b>binmode()</b> on closed filehandle %s</dt>
  <dd>(W unopened) You tried <b>binmode()</b> on a filehandle that was never
      opened. Check your control flow and number of arguments.</dd>
  <dt>Bit vector size &gt; 32 non-portable</dt>
  <dd>(W portable) Using bit vector sizes larger than 32 is non-portable.</dd>
  <dt>Bizarre copy of %s</dt>
  <dd>(P) Perl detected an attempt to copy an internal value that is not
      copiable.</dd>
  <dt>Bizarre SvTYPE [%d]</dt>
  <dd>(P) When starting a new thread or returning values from a thread, Perl
      encountered an invalid data type.</dd>
  <dt>Both or neither range ends should be Unicode in regex; marked by
    &lt;--&#x00A0;HERE in m/%s/</dt>
  <dd>(W regexp) (only under
      <span class="Li">&quot;use&#x00A0;re&#x00A0;'strict'&quot;</span> or
      within <span class="Li">&quot;(?[...])&quot;</span>)
    <p class="Pp">In a bracketed character class in a regular expression
        pattern, you had a range which has exactly one end of it specified using
        <span class="Li">&quot;\N{}&quot;</span>, and the other end is specified
        using a non-portable mechanism. Perl treats the range as a Unicode
        range, that is, all the characters in it are considered to be the
        Unicode characters, and which may be different code points on some
        platforms Perl runs on. For example,
        <span class="Li">&quot;[\N{U+06}-\x08]&quot;</span> is treated as if you
        had instead said
        <span class="Li">&quot;[\N{U+06}-\N{U+08}]&quot;</span>, that is it
        matches the characters whose code points in Unicode are 6, 7, and 8. But
        that <span class="Li">&quot;\x08&quot;</span> might indicate that you
        meant something different, so the warning gets raised.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Buffer overflow in prime_env_iter: %s</dt>
  <dd>(W internal) A warning peculiar to VMS. While Perl was preparing to
      iterate over <span class="Li">%ENV</span>, it encountered a logical name
      or symbol definition which was too long, so it was truncated to the string
      shown.</dd>
  <dt>Callback called exit</dt>
  <dd>(F) A subroutine invoked from an external package via <b>call_sv()</b>
      exited by calling exit.</dd>
  <dt>%s() called too early to check prototype</dt>
  <dd>(W prototype) You've called a function that has a prototype before the
      parser saw a definition or declaration for it, and Perl could not check
      that the call conforms to the prototype. You need to either add an early
      prototype declaration for the subroutine in question, or move the
      subroutine definition ahead of the call to get proper prototype checking.
      Alternatively, if you are certain that you're calling the function
      correctly, you may put an ampersand before the name to avoid the warning.
      See perlsub.</dd>
  <dt>Cannot chr %f</dt>
  <dd>(F) You passed an invalid number (like an infinity or not-a-number) to
      <span class="Li">&quot;chr&quot;</span>.</dd>
  <dt>Cannot complete in-place edit of %s: %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) Your perl script appears to have changed directory while performing an
      in-place edit of a file specified by a relative path, and your system
      doesn't include the directory relative POSIX functions needed to handle
      that.</dd>
  <dt>Cannot compress %f in pack</dt>
  <dd>(F) You tried compressing an infinity or not-a-number as an unsigned
      integer with BER, which makes no sense.</dd>
  <dt>Cannot compress integer in pack</dt>
  <dd>(F) An argument to pack(&quot;w&quot;,...) was too large to compress. The
      BER compressed integer format can only be used with positive integers, and
      you attempted to compress a very large number (&gt; 1e308). See
      &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt>Cannot compress negative numbers in pack</dt>
  <dd>(F) An argument to pack(&quot;w&quot;,...) was negative. The BER
      compressed integer format can only be used with positive integers. See
      &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt>Cannot convert a reference to %s to typeglob</dt>
  <dd>(F) You manipulated Perl's symbol table directly, stored a reference in
      it, then tried to access that symbol via conventional Perl syntax. The
      access triggers Perl to autovivify that typeglob, but it there is no legal
      conversion from that type of reference to a typeglob.</dd>
  <dt>Cannot copy to %s</dt>
  <dd>(P) Perl detected an attempt to copy a value to an internal type that
      cannot be directly assigned to.</dd>
  <dt>Cannot find encoding &quot;%s&quot;</dt>
  <dd>(S io) You tried to apply an encoding that did not exist to a filehandle,
      either with <b>open()</b> or <b>binmode()</b>.</dd>
  <dt>Cannot open %s as a dirhandle: it is already open as a filehandle</dt>
  <dd>(F) You tried to use <b>opendir()</b> to associate a dirhandle to a symbol
      (glob or scalar) that already holds a filehandle. Since this idiom might
      render your code confusing, it was deprecated in Perl 5.10. As of Perl
      5.28, it is a fatal error.</dd>
  <dt>Cannot open %s as a filehandle: it is already open as a dirhandle</dt>
  <dd>(F) You tried to use <b>open()</b> to associate a filehandle to a symbol
      (glob or scalar) that already holds a dirhandle. Since this idiom might
      render your code confusing, it was deprecated in Perl 5.10. As of Perl
      5.28, it is a fatal error.</dd>
  <dt>Cannot pack %f with '%c'</dt>
  <dd>(F) You tried converting an infinity or not-a-number to an integer, which
      makes no sense.</dd>
  <dt>Cannot printf %f with '%c'</dt>
  <dd>(F) You tried printing an infinity or not-a-number as a character (%c),
      which makes no sense. Maybe you meant '%s', or just stringifying it?</dd>
  <dt>Cannot set tied @DB::args</dt>
  <dd>(F) <span class="Li">&quot;caller&quot;</span> tried to set
      <span class="Li">@DB::args</span>, but found it tied. Tying
      <span class="Li">@DB::args</span> is not supported. (Before this error was
      added, it used to crash.)</dd>
  <dt>Cannot tie unreifiable array</dt>
  <dd>(P) You somehow managed to call <span class="Li">&quot;tie&quot;</span> on
      an array that does not keep a reference count on its arguments and cannot
      be made to do so. Such arrays are not even supposed to be accessible to
      Perl code, but are only used internally.</dd>
  <dt>Cannot yet reorder <b>sv_vcatpvfn()</b> arguments from va_list</dt>
  <dd>(F) Some XS code tried to use
      <span class="Li">&quot;sv_vcatpvfn()&quot;</span> or a related function
      with a format string that specifies explicit indexes for some of the
      elements, and using a C-style variable-argument list (a
      <span class="Li">&quot;va_list&quot;</span>). This is not currently
      supported. XS authors wanting to do this must instead construct a C array
      of <span class="Li">&quot;SV*&quot;</span> scalars containing the
      arguments.</dd>
  <dt>Can only compress unsigned integers in pack</dt>
  <dd>(F) An argument to pack(&quot;w&quot;,...) was not an integer. The BER
      compressed integer format can only be used with positive integers, and you
      attempted to compress something else. See &quot;pack&quot; in
    perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt>Can't bless non-reference value</dt>
  <dd>(F) Only hard references may be blessed. This is how Perl
      &quot;enforces&quot; encapsulation of objects. See perlobj.</dd>
  <dt>Can't &quot;break&quot; in a loop topicalizer</dt>
  <dd>(F) You called <span class="Li">&quot;break&quot;</span>, but you're in a
      <span class="Li">&quot;foreach&quot;</span> block rather than a
      <span class="Li">&quot;given&quot;</span> block. You probably meant to use
      <span class="Li">&quot;next&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;last&quot;</span>.</dd>
  <dt>Can't &quot;break&quot; outside a given block</dt>
  <dd>(F) You called <span class="Li">&quot;break&quot;</span>, but you're not
      inside a <span class="Li">&quot;given&quot;</span> block.</dd>
  <dt>Can't call method &quot;%s&quot; on an undefined value</dt>
  <dd>(F) You used the syntax of a method call, but the slot filled by the
      object reference or package name contains an undefined value. Something
      like this will reproduce the error:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    $BADREF = undef;
    process $BADREF 1,2,3;
    $BADREF-&gt;process(1,2,3);
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>Can't call method &quot;%s&quot; on unblessed reference</dt>
  <dd>(F) A method call must know in what package it's supposed to run. It
      ordinarily finds this out from the object reference you supply, but you
      didn't supply an object reference in this case. A reference isn't an
      object reference until it has been blessed. See perlobj.</dd>
  <dt>Can't call method &quot;%s&quot; without a package or object
    reference</dt>
  <dd>(F) You used the syntax of a method call, but the slot filled by the
      object reference or package name contains an expression that returns a
      defined value which is neither an object reference nor a package name.
      Something like this will reproduce the error:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    $BADREF = 42;
    process $BADREF 1,2,3;
    $BADREF-&gt;process(1,2,3);
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>Can't call <b>mro_isa_changed_in()</b> on anonymous symbol table</dt>
  <dd>(P) Perl got confused as to whether a hash was a plain hash or a symbol
      table hash when trying to update <span class="Li">@ISA</span> caches.</dd>
  <dt>Can't call <b>mro_method_changed_in()</b> on anonymous symbol table</dt>
  <dd>(F) An XS module tried to call
      <span class="Li">&quot;mro_method_changed_in&quot;</span> on a hash that
      was not attached to the symbol table.</dd>
  <dt>Can't chdir to %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) You called <span class="Li">&quot;perl -x/foo/bar&quot;</span>, but
      <i>/foo/bar</i> is not a directory that you can chdir to, possibly because
      it doesn't exist.</dd>
  <dt>Can't check filesystem of script &quot;%s&quot; for nosuid</dt>
  <dd>(P) For some reason you can't check the filesystem of the script for
      nosuid.</dd>
  <dt>Can't coerce %s to %s in %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) Certain types of SVs, in particular real symbol table entries
      (typeglobs), can't be forced to stop being what they are. So you can't say
      things like:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    *foo += 1;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">You CAN say</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    $foo = *foo;
    $foo += 1;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">but then <span class="Li">$foo</span> no longer contains a
        glob.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Can't &quot;continue&quot; outside a when block</dt>
  <dd>(F) You called <span class="Li">&quot;continue&quot;</span>, but you're
      not inside a <span class="Li">&quot;when&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;default&quot;</span> block.</dd>
  <dt>Can't create pipe mailbox</dt>
  <dd>(P) An error peculiar to VMS. The process is suffering from exhausted
      quotas or other plumbing problems.</dd>
  <dt>Can't declare %s in &quot;%s&quot;</dt>
  <dd>(F) Only scalar, array, and hash variables may be declared as
      &quot;my&quot;, &quot;our&quot; or &quot;state&quot; variables. They must
      have ordinary identifiers as names.</dd>
  <dt>Can't &quot;default&quot; outside a topicalizer</dt>
  <dd>(F) You have used a <span class="Li">&quot;default&quot;</span> block that
      is neither inside a <span class="Li">&quot;foreach&quot;</span> loop nor a
      <span class="Li">&quot;given&quot;</span> block. (Note that this error is
      issued on exit from the <span class="Li">&quot;default&quot;</span> block,
      so you won't get the error if you use an explicit
      <span class="Li">&quot;continue&quot;</span>.)</dd>
  <dt>Can't determine class of operator %s, assuming BASEOP</dt>
  <dd>(S) This warning indicates something wrong in the internals of perl. Perl
      was trying to find the class (e.g. LISTOP) of a particular OP, and was
      unable to do so. This is likely to be due to a bug in the perl internals,
      or due to a bug in XS code which manipulates perl optrees.</dd>
  <dt>Can't do inplace edit: %s is not a regular file</dt>
  <dd>(S inplace) You tried to use the <b>-i</b> switch on a special file, such
      as a file in /dev, a FIFO or an uneditable directory. The file was
      ignored.</dd>
  <dt>Can't do inplace edit on %s: %s</dt>
  <dd>(S inplace) The creation of the new file failed for the indicated
    reason.</dd>
  <dt>Can't do inplace edit without backup</dt>
  <dd>(F) You're on a system such as MS-DOS that gets confused if you try
      reading from a deleted (but still opened) file. You have to say
      <span class="Li">&quot;-i.bak&quot;</span>, or some such.</dd>
  <dt>Can't do inplace edit: %s would not be unique</dt>
  <dd>(S inplace) Your filesystem does not support filenames longer than 14
      characters and Perl was unable to create a unique filename during inplace
      editing with the <b>-i</b> switch. The file was ignored.</dd>
  <dt>Can't do %s(&quot;%s&quot;) on non-UTF-8 locale; resolved to
    &quot;%s&quot;.</dt>
  <dd>(W locale) You are 1) running under &quot;<span class="Li">&quot;use
      locale&quot;</span>&quot;; 2) the current locale is not a UTF-8 one; 3)
      you tried to do the designated case-change operation on the specified
      Unicode character; and 4) the result of this operation would mix Unicode
      and locale rules, which likely conflict. Mixing of different rule types is
      forbidden, so the operation was not done; instead the result is the
      indicated value, which is the best available that uses entirely Unicode
      rules. That turns out to almost always be the original character,
      unchanged.
    <p class="Pp">It is generally a bad idea to mix non-UTF-8 locales and
        Unicode, and this issue is one of the reasons why. This warning is
        raised when Unicode rules would normally cause the result of this
        operation to contain a character that is in the range specified by the
        locale, 0..255, and hence is subject to the locale's rules, not
        Unicode's.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you are using locale purely for its characteristics related
        to things like its numeric and time formatting (and not
        <span class="Li">&quot;LC_CTYPE&quot;</span>), consider using a

        locale&quot; pragma&quot; in perllocale) like
        &quot;<span class="Li">&quot;use&#x00A0;locale&#x00A0;':not_characters'&quot;</span>&quot;.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that failed case-changing operations done as a result of

        regular expression engine calls behind the scenes.)</p>

  <dt>Can't do waitpid with flags</dt>
  <dd>(F) This machine doesn't have either <b>waitpid()</b> or <b>wait4()</b>,
      so only <b>waitpid()</b> without flags is emulated.</dd>
  <dt>Can't emulate -%s on #! line</dt>
  <dd>(F) The #! line specifies a switch that doesn't make sense at this point.
      For example, it'd be kind of silly to put a <b>-x</b> on the #! line.</dd>
  <dt>Can't %s %s-endian %ss on this platform</dt>
  <dd>(F) Your platform's byte-order is neither big-endian nor little-endian, or
      it has a very strange pointer size. Packing and unpacking big- or
      little-endian floating point values and pointers may not be possible. See
      &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt>Can't exec &quot;%s&quot;: %s</dt>
  <dd>(W exec) A <b>system()</b>, <b>exec()</b>, or piped open call could not
      execute the named program for the indicated reason. Typical reasons
      include: the permissions were wrong on the file, the file wasn't found in
      <span class="Li">$ENV{PATH}</span>, the executable in question was
      compiled for another architecture, or the #! line in a script points to an
      interpreter that can't be run for similar reasons. (Or maybe your system
      doesn't support #! at all.)</dd>
  <dt>Can't exec %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) Perl was trying to execute the indicated program for you because
      that's what the #! line said. If that's not what you wanted, you may need
      to mention &quot;perl&quot; on the #! line somewhere.</dd>
  <dt>Can't execute %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) You used the <b>-S</b> switch, but the copies of the script to execute

      <span class="Li">&quot;word&quot;</span>.</dd>
  <dt>Can't find label %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) You said to goto a label that isn't mentioned anywhere that it's
      possible for us to go to. See &quot;goto&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt>Can't find %s on PATH</dt>
  <dd>(F) You used the <b>-S</b> switch, but the script to execute could not be
      found in the PATH.</dd>
  <dt>Can't find %s on PATH, '.' not in PATH</dt>
  <dd>(F) You used the <b>-S</b> switch, but the script to execute could not be
      found in the PATH, or at least not with the correct permissions. The
      script exists in the current directory, but PATH prohibits running
    it.</dd>
  <dt>Can't find string terminator %s anywhere before EOF</dt>
  <dd>(F) Perl strings can stretch over multiple lines. This message means that
      the closing delimiter was omitted. Because bracketed quotes count nesting
      levels, the following is missing its final parenthesis:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    print q(The character '(' starts a side comment.);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If you're getting this error from a here-document, you may
        have included unseen whitespace before or after your closing tag or
        there may not be a linebreak after it. A good programmer's editor will
        have a way to help you find these characters (or lack of characters).

  <dd></dd>
  <dt>Can't find Unicode property definition &quot;%s&quot; in regex; marked by

  <dd>(F) The named property which you specified via
      <span class="Li">&quot;\p&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;\P&quot;</span> is not one known to Perl. Perhaps
      you misspelled the name? See &quot;Properties accessible through \p{} and
      \P{}&quot; in perluniprops for a complete list of available official
      properties. If it is a user-defined property it must have been defined by
      the time the regular expression is matched.

  <dt>Can't fork: %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) A fatal error occurred while trying to fork while opening a

  <dt>Can't fork, trying again in 5 seconds</dt>
  <dd>(W pipe) A fork in a piped open failed with EAGAIN and will be retried
      after five seconds.</dd>
  <dt>Can't get filespec - stale stat buffer?</dt>
  <dd>(S) A warning peculiar to VMS. This arises because of the difference
      between access checks under VMS and under the Unix model Perl assumes.
      Under VMS, access checks are done by filename, rather than by bits in the
      stat buffer, so that ACLs and other protections can be taken into account.
      Unfortunately, Perl assumes that the stat buffer contains all the
      necessary information, and passes it, instead of the filespec, to the
      access-checking routine. It will try to retrieve the filespec using the
      device name and FID present in the stat buffer, but this works only if you
      haven't made a subsequent call to the CRTL <b>stat()</b> routine, because
      the device name is overwritten with each call. If this warning appears,
      the name lookup failed, and the access-checking routine gave up and
      returned FALSE, just to be conservative. (Note: The access-checking
      routine knows about the Perl <span class="Li">&quot;stat&quot;</span>
      operator and file tests, so you shouldn't ever see this warning in
      response to a Perl command; it arises only if some internal code takes
      stat buffers lightly.)</dd>
  <dt>Can't get pipe mailbox device name</dt>
  <dd>(P) An error peculiar to VMS. After creating a mailbox to act as a pipe,
      Perl can't retrieve its name for later use.</dd>
  <dt>Can't get SYSGEN parameter value for MAXBUF</dt>
  <dd>(P) An error peculiar to VMS. Perl asked <span class="Li">$GETSYI</span>
      how big you want your mailbox buffers to be, and didn't get an
    answer.</dd>
  <dt>Can't &quot;goto&quot; into a binary or list expression</dt>
  <dd>(F) A &quot;goto&quot; statement was executed to jump into the middle of a
      binary or list expression. You can't get there from here. The reason for
      this restriction is that the interpreter would get confused as to how many
      arguments there are, resulting in stack corruption or crashes. This error
      occurs in cases such as these:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    goto F;
    print do { F: }; # Can't jump into the arguments to print

    goto G;
    $x + do { G: $y }; # How is + supposed to get its first operand?
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>Can't &quot;goto&quot; into a &quot;given&quot; block</dt>
  <dd>(F) A &quot;goto&quot; statement was executed to jump into the middle of a
      <span class="Li">&quot;given&quot;</span> block. You can't get there from
      here. See &quot;goto&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt>Can't &quot;goto&quot; into the middle of a foreach loop</dt>
  <dd>(F) A &quot;goto&quot; statement was executed to jump into the middle of a
      foreach loop. You can't get there from here. See &quot;goto&quot; in
      perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt>Can't &quot;goto&quot; out of a pseudo block</dt>
  <dd>(F) A &quot;goto&quot; statement was executed to jump out of what might
      look like a block, except that it isn't a proper block. This usually
      occurs if you tried to jump out of a <b>sort()</b> block or subroutine,
      which is a no-no. See &quot;goto&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt>Can't goto subroutine from an eval-%s</dt>
  <dd>(F) The &quot;goto subroutine&quot; call can't be used to jump out of an
      eval &quot;string&quot; or block.</dd>
  <dt>Can't goto subroutine from a sort sub (or similar callback)</dt>
  <dd>(F) The &quot;goto subroutine&quot; call can't be used to jump out of the
      comparison sub for a <b>sort()</b>, or from a similar callback (such as
      the <b>reduce()</b> function in List::Util).</dd>
  <dt>Can't goto subroutine outside a subroutine</dt>
  <dd>(F) The deeply magical &quot;goto subroutine&quot; call can only replace
      one subroutine call for another. It can't manufacture one out of whole
      cloth. In general you should be calling it out of only an AUTOLOAD routine
      anyway. See &quot;goto&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt>Can't ignore signal CHLD, forcing to default</dt>
  <dd>(W signal) Perl has detected that it is being run with the SIGCHLD signal
      (sometimes known as SIGCLD) disabled. Since disabling this signal will
      interfere with proper determination of exit status of child processes,
      Perl has reset the signal to its default value. This situation typically
      indicates that the parent program under which Perl may be running (e.g.
      cron) is being very careless.</dd>
  <dt>Can't kill a non-numeric process ID</dt>
  <dd>(F) Process identifiers must be (signed) integers. It is a fatal error to
      attempt to <b>kill()</b> an undefined, empty-string or otherwise
      non-numeric process identifier.</dd>
  <dt>Can't &quot;last&quot; outside a loop block</dt>
  <dd>(F) A &quot;last&quot; statement was executed to break out of the current
      block, except that there's this itty bitty problem called there isn't a
      current block. Note that an &quot;if&quot; or &quot;else&quot; block
      doesn't count as a &quot;loopish&quot; block, as doesn't a block given to
      <b>sort()</b>, <b>map()</b> or <b>grep()</b>. You can usually double the
      curlies to get the same effect though, because the inner curlies will be
      considered a block that loops once. See &quot;last&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt>Can't linearize anonymous symbol table</dt>
  <dd>(F) Perl tried to calculate the method resolution order (MRO) of a
      package, but failed because the package stash has no name.</dd>
  <dt>Can't load '%s' for module %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) The module you tried to load failed to load a dynamic extension. This
      may either mean that you upgraded your version of perl to one that is
      incompatible with your old dynamic extensions (which is known to happen
      between major versions of perl), or (more likely) that your dynamic
      extension was built against an older version of the library that is
      installed on your system. You may need to rebuild your old dynamic
      extensions.</dd>
  <dt>Can't localize lexical variable %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) You used local on a variable name that was previously declared as a
      lexical variable using &quot;my&quot; or &quot;state&quot;. This is not
      allowed. If you want to localize a package variable of the same name,
      qualify it with the package name.</dd>
  <dt>Can't localize through a reference</dt>
  <dd>(F) You said something like <span class="Li">&quot;local
      $$ref&quot;</span>, which Perl can't currently handle, because when it
      goes to restore the old value of whatever <span class="Li">$ref</span>
      pointed to after the scope of the <b>local()</b> is finished, it can't be
      sure that <span class="Li">$ref</span> will still be a reference.</dd>
  <dt>Can't locate %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) You said to <span class="Li">&quot;do&quot;</span> (or
      <span class="Li">&quot;require&quot;</span>, or
      <span class="Li">&quot;use&quot;</span>) a file that couldn't be found.
      Perl looks for the file in all the locations mentioned in
      <span class="Li">@INC</span>, unless the file name included the full path
      to the file. Perhaps you need to set the PERL5LIB or PERL5OPT environment
      variable to say where the extra library is, or maybe the script needs to
      add the library name to <span class="Li">@INC</span>. Or maybe you just
      misspelled the name of the file. See &quot;require&quot; in perlfunc and
      lib.</dd>
  <dt>Can't locate auto/%s.al in @INC</dt>
  <dd>(F) A function (or method) was called in a package which allows autoload,
      but there is no function to autoload. Most probable causes are a misprint
      in a function/method name or a failure to
      <span class="Li">&quot;AutoSplit&quot;</span> the file, say, by doing
      <span class="Li">&quot;make install&quot;</span>.</dd>
  <dt>Can't locate loadable object for module %s in @INC</dt>
  <dd>(F) The module you loaded is trying to load an external library, like for
      example, <i>foo.so</i> or <i>bar.dll</i>, but the DynaLoader module was
      unable to locate this library. See DynaLoader.</dd>
  <dt>Can't locate object method &quot;%s&quot; via package &quot;%s&quot;</dt>
  <dd>(F) You called a method correctly, and it correctly indicated a package
      functioning as a class, but that package doesn't define that particular
      method, nor does any of its base classes. See perlobj.</dd>
  <dt>Can't locate object method &quot;%s&quot; via package &quot;%s&quot;
    (perhaps you forgot to load &quot;%s&quot;?)</dt>
  <dd>(F) You called a method on a class that did not exist, and the method
      could not be found in UNIVERSAL. This often means that a method requires a
      package that has not been loaded.</dd>
  <dt>Can't locate package %s for @%s::ISA</dt>
  <dd>(W syntax) The <span class="Li">@ISA</span> array contained the name of
      another package that doesn't seem to exist.</dd>
  <dt>Can't locate PerlIO%s</dt>
  <dd>(F) You tried to use in <b>open()</b> a PerlIO layer that does not exist,
      e.g. open(FH, &quot;&gt;:nosuchlayer&quot;, &quot;somefile&quot;).</dd>
  <dt>Can't make list assignment to %ENV on this system</dt>
  <dd>(F) List assignment to <span class="Li">%ENV</span> is not supported on
      some systems, notably VMS.</dd>
  <dt>Can't make loaded symbols global on this platform while loading %s</dt>
  <dd>(S) A module passed the flag 0x01 to <b>DynaLoader::dl_load_file()</b> to
      request that symbols from the stated file are made available globally
      within the process, but that functionality is not available on this
      platform. Whilst the module likely will still work, this may prevent the
      perl interpreter from loading other XS-based extensions which need to link
      directly to functions defined in the C or XS code in the stated file.</dd>
  <dt>Can't modify %s in %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) You aren't allowed to assign to the item indicated, or otherwise try
      to change it, such as with an auto-increment.</dd>
  <dt>Can't modify nonexistent substring</dt>
  <dd>(P) The internal routine that does assignment to a <b>substr()</b> was
      handed a NULL.</dd>
  <dt>Can't modify non-lvalue subroutine call of &amp;%s</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>Can't modify non-lvalue subroutine call of &amp;%s in %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) Subroutines meant to be used in lvalue context should be declared as
      such. See &quot;Lvalue subroutines&quot; in perlsub.</dd>
  <dt>Can't modify reference to %s in %s assignment</dt>
  <dd>(F) Only a limited number of constructs can be used as the argument to a
      reference constructor on the left-hand side of an assignment, and what you
      used was not one of them. See &quot;Assigning to References&quot; in
      perlref.</dd>
  <dt>Can't modify reference to localized parenthesized array in list
    assignment</dt>
  <dd>(F) Assigning to <span class="Li">&quot;\local(@array)&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;\(local @array)&quot;</span> is not supported, as
      it is not clear exactly what it should do. If you meant to make
      <span class="Li">@array</span> refer to some other array, use
      <span class="Li">&quot;\@array = \@other_array&quot;</span>. If you want
      to make the elements of <span class="Li">@array</span> aliases of the
      scalars referenced on the right-hand side, use
      <span class="Li">&quot;\(@array) = @scalar_refs&quot;</span>.</dd>
  <dt>Can't modify reference to parenthesized hash in list assignment</dt>
  <dd>(F) Assigning to <span class="Li">&quot;\(%hash)&quot;</span> is not
      supported. If you meant to make <span class="Li">%hash</span> refer to
      some other hash, use <span class="Li">&quot;\%hash =
      \%other_hash&quot;</span>. If you want to make the elements of
      <span class="Li">%hash</span> into aliases of the scalars referenced on
      the right-hand side, use a hash slice:
      <span class="Li">&quot;\@hash{@keys} =
    @those_scalar_refs&quot;</span>.</dd>
  <dt>Can't msgrcv to read-only var</dt>
  <dd>(F) The target of a msgrcv must be modifiable to be used as a receive
      buffer.</dd>
  <dt>Can't &quot;next&quot; outside a loop block</dt>
  <dd>(F) A &quot;next&quot; statement was executed to reiterate the current
      block, but there isn't a current block. Note that an &quot;if&quot; or
      &quot;else&quot; block doesn't count as a &quot;loopish&quot; block, as
      doesn't a block given to <b>sort()</b>, <b>map()</b> or <b>grep()</b>. You
      can usually double the curlies to get the same effect though, because the
      inner curlies will be considered a block that loops once. See
      &quot;next&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt>Can't open %s: %s</dt>
  <dd>(S inplace) The implicit opening of a file through use of the
      <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;&gt;&quot;</span> filehandle, either implicitly
      under the <span class="Li">&quot;-n&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;-p&quot;</span> command-line switches, or
      explicitly, failed for the indicated reason. Usually this is because you
      don't have read permission for a file which you named on the command line.
    <p class="Pp">(F) You tried to call perl with the <b>-e</b> switch, but
        <i>/dev/null</i> (or your operating system's equivalent) could not be
        opened.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Can't open a reference</dt>
  <dd>(W io) You tried to open a scalar reference for reading or writing, using
      the 3-arg <b>open()</b> syntax:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    open FH, '&gt;', $ref;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">but your version of perl is compiled without perlio, and this
        form of open is not supported.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Can't open bidirectional pipe</dt>
  <dd>(W pipe) You tried to say <span class="Li">&quot;open(CMD,
      &quot;|cmd|&quot;)&quot;</span>, which is not supported. You can try any
      of several modules in the Perl library to do this, such as IPC::Open2.
      Alternately, direct the pipe's output to a file using &quot;&gt;&quot;,
      and then read it in under a different file handle.</dd>
  <dt>Can't open error file %s as stderr</dt>
  <dd>(F) An error peculiar to VMS. Perl does its own command line redirection,
      and couldn't open the file specified after '2&gt;' or '2&gt;&gt;' on the
      command line for writing.</dd>
  <dt>Can't open input file %s as stdin</dt>
  <dd>(F) An error peculiar to VMS. Perl does its own command line redirection,
      and couldn't open the file specified after '&lt;' on the command line for
      reading.</dd>
  <dt>Can't open output file %s as stdout</dt>
  <dd>(F) An error peculiar to VMS. Perl does its own command line redirection,

  <dt>Can't open output pipe (name: %s)</dt>
  <dd>(P) An error peculiar to VMS. Perl does its own command line redirection,
      and couldn't open the pipe into which to send data destined for
    stdout.</dd>
  <dt>Can't open perl script &quot;%s&quot;: %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) The script you specified can't be opened for the indicated reason.
    <p class="Pp">If you're debugging a script that uses #!, and normally relies
        on the shell's <span class="Li">$PATH</span> search, the -S option

        <span class="Li">&quot;`which $scriptname`&quot;</span>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Can't read CRTL environ</dt>
  <dd>(S) A warning peculiar to VMS. Perl tried to read an element of
      <span class="Li">%ENV</span> from the CRTL's internal environment array
      and discovered the array was missing. You need to figure out where your
      CRTL misplaced its environ or define <i>PERL_ENV_TABLES</i> (see perlvms)
      so that environ is not searched.</dd>
  <dt>Can't redeclare &quot;%s&quot; in &quot;%s&quot;</dt>
  <dd>(F) A &quot;my&quot;, &quot;our&quot; or &quot;state&quot; declaration was
      found within another declaration, such as <span class="Li">&quot;my ($x,

      $x)&quot;</span>.</dd>
  <dt>Can't &quot;redo&quot; outside a loop block</dt>
  <dd>(F) A &quot;redo&quot; statement was executed to restart the current
      block, but there isn't a current block. Note that an &quot;if&quot; or
      &quot;else&quot; block doesn't count as a &quot;loopish&quot; block, as
      doesn't a block given to <b>sort()</b>, <b>map()</b> or <b>grep()</b>. You
      can usually double the curlies to get the same effect though, because the
      inner curlies will be considered a block that loops once. See
      &quot;redo&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt>Can't remove %s: %s, skipping file</dt>
  <dd>(S inplace) You requested an inplace edit without creating a backup file.
      Perl was unable to remove the original file to replace it with the
      modified file. The file was left unmodified.</dd>
  <dt>Can't rename in-place work file '%s' to '%s': %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) When closed implicitly, the temporary file for in-place editing
      couldn't be renamed to the original filename.</dd>
  <dt>Can't rename %s to %s: %s, skipping file</dt>
  <dd>(F) The rename done by the <b>-i</b> switch failed for some reason,
      probably because you don't have write permission to the directory.</dd>
  <dt>Can't reopen input pipe (name: %s) in binary mode</dt>
  <dd>(P) An error peculiar to VMS. Perl thought stdin was a pipe, and tried to
      reopen it to accept binary data. Alas, it failed.</dd>
  <dt>Can't represent character for Ox%X on this platform</dt>
  <dd>(F) There is a hard limit to how big a character code point can be due to
      the fundamental properties of UTF-8, especially on EBCDIC platforms. The
      given code point exceeds that. The only work-around is to not use such a
      large code point.</dd>
  <dt>Can't reset %ENV on this system</dt>
  <dd>(F) You called <span class="Li">&quot;reset('E')&quot;</span> or similar,
      which tried to reset all variables in the current package beginning with
      &quot;E&quot;. In the main package, that includes
      <span class="Li">%ENV</span>. Resetting <span class="Li">%ENV</span> is
      not supported on some systems, notably VMS.</dd>
  <dt>Can't resolve method &quot;%s&quot; overloading &quot;%s&quot; in package
    &quot;%s&quot;</dt>
  <dd>(F)(P) Error resolving overloading specified by a method name (as opposed
      to a subroutine reference): no such method callable via the package. If
      the method name is <span class="Li">&quot;???&quot;</span>, this is an
      internal error.</dd>
  <dt>Can't return %s from lvalue subroutine</dt>
  <dd>(F) Perl detected an attempt to return illegal lvalues (such as temporary
      or readonly values) from a subroutine used as an lvalue. This is not
      allowed.</dd>
  <dt>Can't return outside a subroutine</dt>
  <dd>(F) The return statement was executed in mainline code, that is, where
      there was no subroutine call to return out of. See perlsub.</dd>
  <dt>Can't return %s to lvalue scalar context</dt>
  <dd>(F) You tried to return a complete array or hash from an lvalue
      subroutine, but you called the subroutine in a way that made Perl think
      you meant to return only one value. You probably meant to write
      parentheses around the call to the subroutine, which tell Perl that the
      call should be in list context.</dd>
  <dt>Can't stat script &quot;%s&quot;</dt>
  <dd>(P) For some reason you can't <b>fstat()</b> the script even though you
      have it open already. Bizarre.</dd>
  <dt>Can't take log of %g</dt>
  <dd>(F) For ordinary real numbers, you can't take the logarithm of a negative
      number or zero. There's a Math::Complex package that comes standard with
      Perl, though, if you really want to do that for the negative numbers.</dd>
  <dt>Can't take sqrt of %g</dt>
  <dd>(F) For ordinary real numbers, you can't take the square root of a
      negative number. There's a Math::Complex package that comes standard with
      Perl, though, if you really want to do that.</dd>
  <dt>Can't undef active subroutine</dt>
  <dd>(F) You can't undefine a routine that's currently running. You can,
      however, redefine it while it's running, and you can even undef the
      redefined subroutine while the old routine is running. Go figure.</dd>
  <dt>Can't unweaken a nonreference</dt>
  <dd>(F) You attempted to unweaken something that was not a reference. Only
      references can be unweakened.</dd>
  <dt>Can't upgrade %s (%d) to %d</dt>
  <dd>(P) The internal sv_upgrade routine adds &quot;members&quot; to an SV,
      making it into a more specialized kind of SV. The top several SV types are
      so specialized, however, that they cannot be interconverted. This message
      indicates that such a conversion was attempted.</dd>
  <dt>Can't use '%c' after -mname</dt>
  <dd>(F) You tried to call perl with the <b>-m</b> switch, but you put
      something other than &quot;=&quot; after the module name.</dd>
  <dt>Can't use a hash as a reference</dt>
  <dd>(F) You tried to use a hash as a reference, as in
      <span class="Li">&quot;%foo-&gt;{&quot;bar&quot;}&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;%$ref-&gt;{&quot;hello&quot;}&quot;</span>.
      Versions of perl &lt;= 5.22.0 used to allow this syntax, but shouldn't
      have. This was deprecated in perl 5.6.1.</dd>
  <dt>Can't use an array as a reference</dt>
  <dd>(F) You tried to use an array as a reference, as in
      <span class="Li">&quot;@foo-&gt;[23]&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;@$ref-&gt;[99]&quot;</span>. Versions of perl &lt;=
      5.22.0 used to allow this syntax, but shouldn't have. This was deprecated
      in perl 5.6.1.</dd>
  <dt>Can't use anonymous symbol table for method lookup</dt>
  <dd>(F) The internal routine that does method lookup was handed a symbol table
      that doesn't have a name. Symbol tables can become anonymous for example
      by undefining stashes: <span class="Li">&quot;undef
      %Some::Package::&quot;</span>.</dd>
  <dt>Can't use an undefined value as %s reference</dt>
  <dd>(F) A value used as either a hard reference or a symbolic reference must
      be a defined value. This helps to delurk some insidious errors.</dd>
  <dt>Can't use bareword (&quot;%s&quot;) as %s ref while &quot;strict
    refs&quot; in use</dt>
  <dd>(F) Only hard references are allowed by &quot;strict refs&quot;. Symbolic
      references are disallowed. See perlref.</dd>
  <dt>Can't use %! because Errno.pm is not available</dt>
  <dd>(F) The first time the <span class="Li">&quot;%!&quot;</span> hash is
      used, perl automatically loads the Errno.pm module. The Errno module is
      expected to tie the %! hash to provide symbolic names for
      <span class="Li">$!</span> errno values.</dd>
  <dt>Can't use both '&lt;' and '&gt;' after type '%c' in %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) A type cannot be forced to have both big-endian and little-endian
      byte-order at the same time, so this combination of modifiers is not
      allowed. See &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt>Can't use 'defined(@array)' (Maybe you should just omit the
    <b>defined()</b>?)</dt>
  <dd>(F) <b>defined()</b> is not useful on arrays because it checks for an
      undefined <i>scalar</i> value. If you want to see if the array is empty,
      just use <span class="Li">&quot;if (@array) { # not empty }&quot;</span>
      for example.</dd>
  <dt>Can't use 'defined(%hash)' (Maybe you should just omit the
    <b>defined()</b>?)</dt>
  <dd>(F) <span class="Li">&quot;defined()&quot;</span> is not usually right on
      hashes.
    <p class="Pp">Although <span class="Li">&quot;defined %hash&quot;</span> is
        false on a plain not-yet-used hash, it becomes true in several
        non-obvious circumstances, including iterators, weak references, stash
        names, even remaining true after <span class="Li">&quot;undef
        %hash&quot;</span>. These things make <span class="Li">&quot;defined
        %hash&quot;</span> fairly useless in practice, so it now generates a
        fatal error.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If a check for non-empty is what you wanted then just put it
        in boolean context (see &quot;Scalar values&quot; in perldata):</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    if (%hash) {
       # not empty
    }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If you had <span class="Li">&quot;defined
        %Foo::Bar::QUUX&quot;</span> to check whether such a package variable
        exists then that's never really been reliable, and isn't a good way to
        enquire about the features of a package, or whether it's loaded,
      etc.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Can't use %s for loop variable</dt>
  <dd>(P) The parser got confused when trying to parse a
      <span class="Li">&quot;foreach&quot;</span> loop.</dd>
  <dt>Can't use global %s in &quot;%s&quot;</dt>
  <dd>(F) You tried to declare a magical variable as a lexical variable. This is
      not allowed, because the magic can be tied to only one location (namely
      the global variable) and it would be incredibly confusing to have
      variables in your program that looked like magical variables but
    weren't.</dd>
  <dt>Can't use '%c' in a group with different byte-order in %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) You attempted to force a different byte-order on a type that is
      already inside a group with a byte-order modifier. For example you cannot
      force little-endianness on a type that is inside a big-endian group.</dd>
  <dt>Can't use &quot;my %s&quot; in sort comparison</dt>
  <dd>(F) The global variables <span class="Li">$a</span> and
      <span class="Li">$b</span> are reserved for sort comparisons. You
      mentioned <span class="Li">$a</span> or <span class="Li">$b</span> in the
      same line as the &lt;=&gt; or cmp operator, and the variable had earlier
      been declared as a lexical variable. Either qualify the sort variable with
      the package name, or rename the lexical variable.</dd>
  <dt>Can't use %s ref as %s ref</dt>
  <dd>(F) You've mixed up your reference types. You have to dereference a
      reference of the type needed. You can use the <b>ref()</b> function to
      test the type of the reference, if need be.</dd>
  <dt>Can't use string (&quot;%s&quot;) as %s ref while &quot;strict refs&quot;
    in use</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>Can't use string (&quot;%s&quot;...) as %s ref while &quot;strict
    refs&quot; in use</dt>
  <dd>(F) You've told Perl to dereference a string, something which
      <span class="Li">&quot;use strict&quot;</span> blocks to prevent it
      happening accidentally. See &quot;Symbolic references&quot; in perlref.
      This can be triggered by an <span class="Li">&quot;@&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;$&quot;</span> in a double-quoted string
      immediately before interpolating a variable, for example in
      <span class="Li">&quot;user @$twitter_id&quot;</span>, which says to treat
      the contents of <span class="Li">$twitter_id</span> as an array reference;
      use a <span class="Li">&quot;\&quot;</span> to have a literal
      <span class="Li">&quot;@&quot;</span> symbol followed by the contents of
      <span class="Li">$twitter_id</span>: <span class="Li">&quot;user
      \@$twitter_id&quot;</span>.</dd>
  <dt>Can't use subscript on %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) The compiler tried to interpret a bracketed expression as a subscript.
      But to the left of the brackets was an expression that didn't look like a
      hash or array reference, or anything else subscriptable.</dd>
  <dt>Can't use \%c to mean $%c in expression</dt>
  <dd>(W syntax) In an ordinary expression, backslash is a unary operator that
      creates a reference to its argument. The use of backslash to indicate a
      backreference to a matched substring is valid only as part of a regular
      expression pattern. Trying to do this in ordinary Perl code produces a
      value that prints out looking like <b>SCALAR</b>(0xdecaf). Use the
      <span class="Li">$1</span> form instead.</dd>
  <dt>Can't weaken a nonreference</dt>
  <dd>(F) You attempted to weaken something that was not a reference. Only
      references can be weakened.</dd>
  <dt>Can't &quot;when&quot; outside a topicalizer</dt>
  <dd>(F) You have used a <b>when()</b> block that is neither inside a
      <span class="Li">&quot;foreach&quot;</span> loop nor a
      <span class="Li">&quot;given&quot;</span> block. (Note that this error is
      issued on exit from the <span class="Li">&quot;when&quot;</span> block, so
      you won't get the error if the match fails, or if you use an explicit
      <span class="Li">&quot;continue&quot;</span>.)</dd>
  <dt>Can't x= to read-only value</dt>
  <dd>(F) You tried to repeat a constant value (often the undefined value) with
      an assignment operator, which implies modifying the value itself. Perhaps
      you need to copy the value to a temporary, and repeat that.</dd>
  <dt>Character following &quot;\c&quot; must be printable ASCII</dt>
  <dd>(F) In
      <span class="Li">&quot;\c</span><i>X</i><span class="Li">&quot;</span>,
      <i>X</i> must be a printable (non-control) ASCII character.
    <p class="Pp">Note that ASCII characters that don't map to control
        characters are discouraged, and will generate the warning (when enabled)
        &quot;&quot;\c%c&quot; is more clearly written simply as
        &quot;%s&quot;&quot;.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Character following \%c must be '{' or a single-character Unicode property
    name in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/</dt>
  <dd>(F) (In the above the <span class="Li">%c</span> is replaced by either
      <span class="Li">&quot;p&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;P&quot;</span>.) You specified something that isn't
      a legal Unicode property name. Most Unicode properties are specified by
      <span class="Li">&quot;\p{...}&quot;</span>. But if the name is a single
      character one, the braces may be omitted.</dd>

    <p class="Pp">where the format expects to process a byte (a character with a

  <dd>(W syntax) The
      <span class="Li">&quot;\c</span><i>X</i><span class="Li">&quot;</span>
      construct is intended to be a way to specify non-printable characters. You
      used it for a printable one, which is better written as simply itself,
      perhaps preceded by a backslash for non-word characters. Doing it the way
      you did is not portable between ASCII and EBCDIC platforms.</dd>
  <dt>Cloning substitution context is unimplemented</dt>

  <dt>\C no longer supported in regex; marked by &lt;--&#x00A0;HERE in

  <dd>(F) The \C character class used to allow a match of single byte within a
      multi-byte utf-8 character, but was removed in v5.24 as it broke
      encapsulation and its implementation was extremely buggy. If you really
      need to process the individual bytes, you probably want to convert your
      string to one where each underlying byte is stored as a character, with
      <b>utf8::encode()</b>.</dd>
  <dt>Code missing after '/'</dt>
  <dd>(F) You had a (sub-)template that ends with a '/'. There must be another
      template code following the slash. See &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt>Code point 0x%X is not Unicode, and not portable</dt>
  <dd>(S non_unicode) You had a code point that has never been in any standard,
      so it is likely that languages other than Perl will NOT understand it. At
      one time, it was legal in some standards to have code points up to
      0x7FFF_FFFF, but not higher, and this code point is higher.
    <p class="Pp">Acceptance of these code points is a Perl extension, and you
        should expect that nothing other than Perl can handle them; Perl itself
        on EBCDIC platforms before v5.24 does not handle them.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Code points above 0xFFFF_FFFF require larger than a 32 bit
        word.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Perl also makes no guarantees that the representation of these
        code points won't change at some point in the future, say when machines
        become available that have larger than a 64-bit word. At that time,
        files written by an older Perl would require conversion before being
        readable by a newer Perl.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Code point 0x%X is not Unicode, may not be portable</dt>
  <dd>(S non_unicode) You had a code point above the Unicode maximum of
      U+10FFFF.
    <p class="Pp">Perl allows strings to contain a superset of Unicode code
        points, but these may not be accepted by other languages/systems.
        Further, even if these languages/systems accept these large code points,
        they may have chosen a different representation for them than the
        UTF-8-like one that Perl has, which would mean files are not
        exchangeable between them and Perl.</p>
    <p class="Pp">On EBCDIC platforms, code points above 0x3FFF_FFFF have a
        different representation in Perl v5.24 than before, so any file
        containing these that was written before that version will require
        conversion before being readable by a later Perl.</p>

  <dd>(W regexp) The regular expression engine uses recursion in complex
      situations where back-tracking is required. Recursion depth is limited to
      32766, or perhaps less in architectures where the stack cannot grow
      arbitrarily. (&quot;Simple&quot; and &quot;medium&quot; situations are
      handled without recursion and are not subject to a limit.) Try shortening
      the string under examination; looping in Perl code (e.g. with
      <span class="Li">&quot;while&quot;</span>) rather than in the regular
      expression engine; or rewriting the regular expression so that it is
      simpler or backtracks less. (See perlfaq2 for information on <i>Mastering
      Regular Expressions</i>.)</dd>
  <dt><b>connect()</b> on closed socket %s</dt>
  <dd>(W closed) You tried to do a connect on a closed socket. Did you forget to
      check the return value of your <b>socket()</b> call? See
      &quot;connect&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt>Constant(%s): Call to &amp;{$^H{%s}} did not return a defined value</dt>
  <dd>(F) The subroutine registered to handle constant overloading (see
      overload) or a custom charnames handler (see &quot;CUSTOM
      TRANSLATORS&quot; in charnames) returned an undefined value.</dd>
  <dt>Constant(%s): $^H{%s} is not defined</dt>
  <dd>(F) The parser found inconsistencies while attempting to define an
      overloaded constant. Perhaps you forgot to load the corresponding overload
      pragma?</dd>
  <dt>Constant is not %s reference</dt>
  <dd>(F) A constant value (perhaps declared using the
      <span class="Li">&quot;use constant&quot;</span> pragma) is being
      dereferenced, but it amounts to the wrong type of reference. The message
      indicates the type of reference that was expected. This usually indicates
      a syntax error in dereferencing the constant value. See &quot;Constant
      Functions&quot; in perlsub and constant.</dd>
  <dt>Constants from lexical variables potentially modified elsewhere are
    deprecated. This will not be allowed in Perl 5.32</dt>
  <dd>(D deprecated) You wrote something like
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    my $var;
    $sub = sub () { $var };
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">but <span class="Li">$var</span> is referenced elsewhere and
        could be modified after the <span class="Li">&quot;sub&quot;</span>
        expression is evaluated. Either it is explicitly modified elsewhere
        (<span class="Li">&quot;$var = 3&quot;</span>) or it is passed to a
        subroutine or to an operator like
        <span class="Li">&quot;printf&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;map&quot;</span>, which may or may not modify the
        variable.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Traditionally, Perl has captured the value of the variable at
        that point and turned the subroutine into a constant eligible for
        inlining. In those cases where the variable can be modified elsewhere,
        this breaks the behavior of closures, in which the subroutine captures
        the variable itself, rather than its value, so future changes to the
        variable are reflected in the subroutine's return value.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This usage is deprecated, and will no longer be allowed in
        Perl 5.32, making it possible to change the behavior in the future.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you intended for the subroutine to be eligible for
        inlining, then make sure the variable is not referenced elsewhere,
        possibly by copying it:</p>

    <pre>
    my $var2 = $var;
    $sub = sub () { $var2 };

  <dd>(F) The parser found inconsistencies either while attempting to define an

  <dt>:const is experimental</dt>
  <dd>(S experimental::const_attr) The &quot;const&quot; attribute is

      doing so you are taking the risk that your code may break in a future Perl
      version.</dd>
  <dt>:const is not permitted on named subroutines</dt>
  <dd>(F) The &quot;const&quot; attribute causes an anonymous subroutine to be

      subroutines are not cloned like this, so the attribute does not make sense
      on them.</dd>
  <dt>Copy method did not return a reference</dt>
  <dd>(F) The method which overloads &quot;=&quot; is buggy. See &quot;Copy
      Constructor&quot; in overload.</dd>
  <dt>&amp;CORE::%s cannot be called directly</dt>
  <dd>(F) You tried to call a subroutine in the
      <span class="Li">&quot;CORE::&quot;</span> namespace with
      <span class="Li">&amp;foo</span> syntax or through a reference. Some
      subroutines in this package cannot yet be called that way, but must be
      called as barewords. Something like this will work:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>

    shove @array, 1,2,3; # pushes on to @array

  <dt>CORE::%s is not a keyword</dt>
  <dd>(F) The CORE:: namespace is reserved for Perl keywords.</dd>
  <dt>Corrupted regexp opcode %d &gt; %d</dt>
  <dd>(P) This is either an error in Perl, or, if you're using one, your custom
      regular expression engine. If not the latter, report the problem through

  <dt>corrupted regexp pointers</dt>
  <dd>(P) The regular expression engine got confused by what the regular

  <dt>Corrupt malloc ptr 0x%x at 0x%x</dt>
  <dd>(P) The malloc package that comes with Perl had an internal failure.</dd>
  <dt>Count after length/code in unpack</dt>
  <dd>(F) You had an unpack template indicating a counted-length string, but you
      have also specified an explicit size for the string. See &quot;pack&quot;
      in perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt>Declaring references is experimental</dt>
  <dd>(S experimental::declared_refs) This warning is emitted if you use a

      <span class="Li">&quot;my&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;state&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;our&quot;</span>, or
      <span class="Li">&quot;local&quot;</span>. Simply suppress the warning if
      you want to use the feature, but know that in doing so you are taking the
      risk of using an experimental feature which may change or be removed in a
      future Perl version:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>

  <dt>Deep recursion on subroutine &quot;%s&quot;</dt>
  <dd>(W recursion) This subroutine has called itself (directly or indirectly)
      100 times more than it has returned. This probably indicates an infinite

      it indicates something else.
    <p class="Pp">This threshold can be changed from 100, by recompiling the

  <dt>Deprecated use of <b>my()</b> in false conditional. This will be a fatal
    error in Perl 5.30</dt>
  <dd>(D deprecated) You used a declaration similar to <span class="Li">&quot;my
      $x if 0&quot;</span>. There has been a long-standing bug in Perl that
      causes a lexical variable not to be cleared at scope exit when its
      declaration includes a false conditional. Some people have exploited this
      bug to achieve a kind of static variable. Since we intend to fix this bug,
      we don't want people relying on this behavior. You can achieve a similar
      static effect by declaring the variable in a separate block outside the
      function, eg
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    sub f { my $x if 0; return $x++ }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">becomes</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    { my $x; sub f { return $x++ } }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Beginning with perl 5.10.0, you can also use
        <span class="Li">&quot;state&quot;</span> variables to have lexicals
        that are initialized only once (see feature):</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    sub f { state $x; return $x++ }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This use of <span class="Li">&quot;my()&quot;</span> in a
        false conditional has been deprecated since Perl 5.10, and it will
        become a fatal error in Perl 5.30.</p>

  <dt>DESTROY created new reference to dead object '%s'</dt>

  <dt>%s did not return a true value</dt>
  <dd>(F) A required (or used) file must return a true value to indicate that it
      compiled correctly and ran its initialization code correctly. It's

      value would do. See &quot;require&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt>(Did you mean &amp;%s instead?)</dt>
  <dd>(W misc) You probably referred to an imported subroutine &amp;FOO as

  <dt>(Did you mean &quot;local&quot; instead of &quot;our&quot;?)</dt>
  <dd>(W shadow) Remember that &quot;our&quot; does not localize the declared
      global variable. You have declared it again in the same lexical scope,
      which seems superfluous.</dd>
  <dt>(Did you mean $ or @ instead of %?)</dt>
  <dd>(W) You probably said <span class="Li">%hash</span>{$key} when you meant
      <span class="Li">$hash</span>{$key} or

      meant <span class="Li">%hash</span> and got carried away.</dd>
  <dt>Died</dt>
  <dd>(F) You passed <b>die()</b> an empty string (the equivalent of
      <span class="Li">&quot;die &quot;&quot;&quot;</span>) or you called it

  <dd>(D deprecated) Previously <span class="Li">&quot; do &quot;somefile&quot;;

  <dt>(Do you need to predeclare %s?)</dt>
  <dd>(S syntax) This is an educated guess made in conjunction with the message
      &quot;%s found where operator expected&quot;. It often means a subroutine
      or module name is being referenced that hasn't been declared yet. This may
      be because of ordering problems in your file, or because of a missing
      &quot;sub&quot;, &quot;package&quot;, &quot;require&quot;, or
      &quot;use&quot; statement. If you're referencing something that isn't
      defined yet, you don't actually have to define the subroutine or package
      before the current location. You can use an empty &quot;sub foo;&quot; or
      &quot;package FOO;&quot; to enter a &quot;forward&quot; declaration.</dd>

      the state of the program's environment. This is potentially insecure.</dd>
  <dt>Error converting file specification %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) An error peculiar to VMS. Because Perl may have to deal with file
      specifications in either VMS or Unix syntax, it converts them to a single
      form when it must operate on them directly. Either you've passed an
      invalid file specification to Perl, or you've found a case the conversion

      time, as it would when the pattern contains interpolated values. Since
      that is a security risk, it is not allowed. If you insist, you may still
      do this by using the <span class="Li">&quot;re 'eval'&quot;</span> pragma
      or by explicitly building the pattern from an interpolated string at run
      time and using that in an <b>eval()</b>. See &quot;(?{ code })&quot; in

  <dd>(F) The <span class="Li">&quot;(?[...])&quot;</span> extended character
      class regular expression construct only allows character classes
      (including character class escapes like

  <dt>Explicit blessing to '' (assuming package main)</dt>
  <dd>(W misc) You are blessing a reference to a zero length string. This has
      the effect of blessing the reference into the package main. This is

  <dd>(W regexp)(F) A character class range must start and end at a literal

      <span class="Li">&quot;\d&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;[:alpha:]&quot;</span>. The &quot;-&quot; in your
      false range is interpreted as a literal &quot;-&quot;. In a
      <span class="Li">&quot;(?[...])&quot;</span> construct, this is an error,
      rather than a warning. Consider quoting the &quot;-&quot;, &quot;\-&quot;.
      The &lt;--&#x00A0;HERE shows whereabouts in the regular expression the
      problem was discovered. See perlre.</dd>
  <dt>Fatal VMS error (status=%d) at %s, line %d</dt>
  <dd>(P) An error peculiar to VMS. Something untoward happened in a VMS system
      service or RTL routine; Perl's exit status should provide more details.
      The filename in &quot;at <span class="Li">%s</span>&quot; and the line
      number in &quot;line <span class="Li">%d</span>&quot; tell you which
      section of the Perl source code is distressed.</dd>
  <dt>fcntl is not implemented</dt>
  <dd>(F) Your machine apparently doesn't implement <b>fcntl()</b>. What is
      this, a PDP-11 or something?</dd>
  <dt>FETCHSIZE returned a negative value</dt>
  <dd>(F) A tied array claimed to have a negative number of elements, which is
      not possible.</dd>
  <dt>Field too wide in 'u' format in pack</dt>
  <dd>(W pack) Each line in an uuencoded string starts with a length indicator
      which can't encode values above 63. So there is no point in asking for a
      line length bigger than that. Perl will behave as if you specified
      <span class="Li">&quot;u63&quot;</span> as the format.</dd>
  <dt><b>File::Glob::glob()</b> will disappear in perl 5.30. Use

  <dd>(D deprecated) <span class="Li">&quot;File::Glob&quot;</span> has a
      function called <span class="Li">&quot;glob&quot;</span>, which just calls
      <span class="Li">&quot;bsd_glob&quot;</span>. However, its prototype is
      different from the prototype of
      <span class="Li">&quot;CORE::glob&quot;</span>, and hence,
      <span class="Li">&quot;File::Glob::glob&quot;</span> should not be used.
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;File::Glob::glob()&quot;</span> was
        deprecated in perl 5.8.0. A deprecation message was issued from perl

  </dd>
  <dt>Filehandle %s opened only for input</dt>
  <dd>(W io) You tried to write on a read-only filehandle. If you intended it to
      be a read-write filehandle, you needed to open it with &quot;+&lt;&quot;
      or &quot;+&gt;&quot; or &quot;+&gt;&gt;&quot; instead of with
      &quot;&lt;&quot; or nothing. If you intended only to write the file, use
      &quot;&gt;&quot; or &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;. See &quot;open&quot; in
      perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt>Filehandle %s opened only for output</dt>
  <dd>(W io) You tried to read from a filehandle opened only for writing, If you
      intended it to be a read/write filehandle, you needed to open it with
      &quot;+&lt;&quot; or &quot;+&gt;&quot; or &quot;+&gt;&gt;&quot; instead of
      with &quot;&gt;&quot;. If you intended only to read from the file, use
      &quot;&lt;&quot;. See &quot;open&quot; in perlfunc. Another possibility is
      that you attempted to open filedescriptor 0 (also known as STDIN) for
      output (maybe you closed STDIN earlier?).</dd>
  <dt>Filehandle %s reopened as %s only for input</dt>
  <dd>(W io) You opened for reading a filehandle that got the same filehandle id
      as STDOUT or STDERR. This occurred because you closed STDOUT or STDERR
      previously.</dd>
  <dt>Filehandle STDIN reopened as %s only for output</dt>
  <dd>(W io) You opened for writing a filehandle that got the same filehandle id
      as STDIN. This occurred because you closed STDIN previously.</dd>
  <dt>Final $ should be \$ or $name</dt>
  <dd>(F) You must now decide whether the final $ in a string was meant to be a
      literal dollar sign, or was meant to introduce a variable name that
      happens to be missing. So you have to put either the backslash or the
      name.</dd>
  <dt><b>flock()</b> on closed filehandle %s</dt>
  <dd>(W closed) The filehandle you're attempting to <b>flock()</b> got itself
      closed some time before now. Check your control flow. <b>flock()</b>
      operates on filehandles. Are you attempting to call <b>flock()</b> on a
      dirhandle by the same name?</dd>
  <dt>Format not terminated</dt>
  <dd>(F) A format must be terminated by a line with a solitary dot. Perl got to
      the end of your file without finding such a line.</dd>
  <dt>Format %s redefined</dt>
  <dd>(W redefine) You redefined a format. To suppress this warning, say
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>

        no warnings 'redefine';
        eval &quot;format NAME =...&quot;;

    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">(or something like that).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>%s found where operator expected</dt>
  <dd>(S syntax) The Perl lexer knows whether to expect a term or an operator.
      If it sees what it knows to be a term when it was expecting to see an
      operator, it gives you this warning. Usually it indicates that an operator
      or delimiter was omitted, such as a semicolon.</dd>
  <dt>gdbm store returned %d, errno %d, key &quot;%s&quot;</dt>
  <dd>(S) A warning from the GDBM_File extension that a store failed.</dd>
  <dt>gethostent not implemented</dt>
  <dd>(F) Your C library apparently doesn't implement <b>gethostent()</b>,
      probably because if it did, it'd feel morally obligated to return every
      hostname on the Internet.</dd>
  <dt>get%<b>sname()</b> on closed socket %s</dt>
  <dd>(W closed) You tried to get a socket or peer socket name on a closed
      socket. Did you forget to check the return value of your <b>socket()</b>
      call?</dd>
  <dt>getpwnam returned invalid UIC %#o for user &quot;%s&quot;</dt>
  <dd>(S) A warning peculiar to VMS. The call to
      <span class="Li">&quot;sys$getuai&quot;</span> underlying the
      <span class="Li">&quot;getpwnam&quot;</span> operator returned an invalid
      UIC.</dd>
  <dt><b>getsockopt()</b> on closed socket %s</dt>
  <dd>(W closed) You tried to get a socket option on a closed socket. Did you
      forget to check the return value of your <b>socket()</b> call? See
      &quot;getsockopt&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt>given is experimental</dt>
  <dd>(S experimental::smartmatch) <span class="Li">&quot;given&quot;</span>
      depends on smartmatch, which is experimental, so its behavior may change
      or even be removed in any future release of perl. See the explanation
      under &quot;Experimental Details on given and when&quot; in perlsyn.</dd>
  <dt>Global symbol &quot;%s&quot; requires explicit package name (did you
    forget to declare &quot;my %s&quot;?)</dt>
  <dd>(F) You've said &quot;use strict&quot; or &quot;use strict vars&quot;,
      which indicates that all variables must either be lexically scoped (using
      &quot;my&quot; or &quot;state&quot;), declared beforehand using
      &quot;our&quot;, or explicitly qualified to say which package the global
      variable is in (using &quot;::&quot;).</dd>
  <dt>glob failed (%s)</dt>
  <dd>(S glob) Something went wrong with the external program(s) used for
      <span class="Li">&quot;glob&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;*.c&gt;&quot;</span>. Usually, this means that
      you supplied a <span class="Li">&quot;glob&quot;</span> pattern that
      caused the external program to fail and exit with a nonzero status. If the
      message indicates that the abnormal exit resulted in a coredump, this may
      also mean that your csh (C shell) is broken. If so, you should change all
      of the csh-related variables in config.sh: If you have tcsh, make the
      variables refer to it as if it were csh (e.g.
      <span class="Li">&quot;full_csh='/usr/bin/tcsh'&quot;</span>); otherwise,
      make them all empty (except that <span class="Li">&quot;d_csh&quot;</span>
      should be <span class="Li">'undef'</span>) so that Perl will think csh is
      missing. In either case, after editing config.sh, run
      <span class="Li">&quot;./Configure -S&quot;</span> and rebuild Perl.</dd>
  <dt>Glob not terminated</dt>
  <dd>(F) The lexer saw a left angle bracket in a place where it was expecting a
      term, so it's looking for the corresponding right angle bracket, and not
      finding it. Chances are you left some needed parentheses out earlier in
      the line, and you really meant a &quot;less than&quot;.</dd>
  <dt>gmtime(%f) failed</dt>
  <dd>(W overflow) You called <span class="Li">&quot;gmtime&quot;</span> with a
      number that it could not handle: too large, too small, or NaN. The
      returned value is <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span>.</dd>
  <dt>gmtime(%f) too large</dt>
  <dd>(W overflow) You called <span class="Li">&quot;gmtime&quot;</span> with a
      number that was larger than it can reliably handle and
      <span class="Li">&quot;gmtime&quot;</span> probably returned the wrong
      date. This warning is also triggered with NaN (the special not-a-number
      value).</dd>
  <dt>gmtime(%f) too small</dt>
  <dd>(W overflow) You called <span class="Li">&quot;gmtime&quot;</span> with a
      number that was smaller than it can reliably handle and
      <span class="Li">&quot;gmtime&quot;</span> probably returned the wrong
      date.</dd>
  <dt>Got an error from DosAllocMem</dt>
  <dd>(P) An error peculiar to OS/2. Most probably you're using an obsolete
      version of Perl, and this should not happen anyway.</dd>
  <dt>goto must have label</dt>
  <dd>(F) Unlike with &quot;next&quot; or &quot;last&quot;, you're not allowed
      to goto an unspecified destination. See &quot;goto&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt>Goto undefined subroutine%s</dt>
  <dd>(F) You tried to call a subroutine with <span class="Li">&quot;goto
      &amp;sub&quot;</span> syntax, but the indicated subroutine hasn't been
      defined, or if it was, it has since been undefined.</dd>
  <dt>Group name must start with a non-digit word character in regex; marked by
    &lt;--&#x00A0;HERE in m/%s/</dt>
  <dd>(F) Group names must follow the rules for perl identifiers, meaning they
      must start with a non-digit word character. A common cause of this error
      is using (?&amp;0) instead of (?0). See perlre.</dd>
  <dt>()-group starts with a count</dt>
  <dd>(F) A ()-group started with a count. A count is supposed to follow
      something: a template character or a ()-group. See &quot;pack&quot; in
      perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt>%s had compilation errors.</dt>
  <dd>(F) The final summary message when a <span class="Li">&quot;perl
      -c&quot;</span> fails.</dd>
  <dt>Had to create %s unexpectedly</dt>
  <dd>(S internal) A routine asked for a symbol from a symbol table that ought
      to have existed already, but for some reason it didn't, and had to be
      created on an emergency basis to prevent a core dump.</dd>
  <dt>%s has too many errors</dt>
  <dd>(F) The parser has given up trying to parse the program after 10 errors.
      Further error messages would likely be uninformative.</dd>
  <dt>Hexadecimal float: exponent overflow</dt>
  <dd>(W overflow) The hexadecimal floating point has a larger exponent than the
      floating point supports.</dd>
  <dt>Hexadecimal float: exponent underflow</dt>
  <dd>(W overflow) The hexadecimal floating point has a smaller exponent than
      the floating point supports. With the IEEE 754 floating point, this may
      also mean that the subnormals (formerly known as denormals) are being
      used, which may or may not be an error.</dd>
  <dt>Hexadecimal float: internal error (%s)</dt>
  <dd>(F) Something went horribly bad in hexadecimal float handling.</dd>
  <dt>Hexadecimal float: mantissa overflow</dt>
  <dd>(W overflow) The hexadecimal floating point literal had more bits in the
      mantissa (the part between the 0x and the exponent, also known as the
      fraction or the significand) than the floating point supports.</dd>
  <dt>Hexadecimal float: precision loss</dt>
  <dd>(W overflow) The hexadecimal floating point had internally more digits
      than could be output. This can be caused by unsupported long double
      formats, or by 64-bit integers not being available (needed to retrieve the
      digits under some configurations).</dd>
  <dt>Hexadecimal float: unsupported long double format</dt>
  <dd>(F) You have configured Perl to use long doubles but the internals of the
      long double format are unknown; therefore the hexadecimal float output is
      impossible.</dd>
  <dt>Hexadecimal number &gt; 0xffffffff non-portable</dt>
  <dd>(W portable) The hexadecimal number you specified is larger than 2**32-1
      (4294967295) and therefore non-portable between systems. See perlport for
      more on portability concerns.</dd>
  <dt>Identifier too long</dt>
  <dd>(F) Perl limits identifiers (names for variables, functions, etc.) to
      about 250 characters for simple names, and somewhat more for compound
      names (like <span class="Li">$A::B</span>). You've exceeded Perl's limits.
      Future versions of Perl are likely to eliminate these arbitrary
      limitations.</dd>
  <dt>Ignoring zero length \N{} in character class in regex; marked by
    &lt;--&#x00A0;HERE in m/%s/</dt>
  <dd>(W regexp) Named Unicode character escapes
      (<span class="Li">&quot;\N{...}&quot;</span>) may return a zero-length
      sequence. When such an escape is used in a character class its behavior is
      not well defined. Check that the correct escape has been used, and the
      correct charname handler is in scope.</dd>
  <dt>Illegal binary digit '%c'</dt>
  <dd>(F) You used a digit other than 0 or 1 in a binary number.</dd>
  <dt>Illegal binary digit %s ignored</dt>
  <dd>(W digit) You may have tried to use a digit other than 0 or 1 in a binary
      number. Interpretation of the binary number stopped before the offending
      digit.</dd>
  <dt>Illegal character after '_' in prototype for %s : %s</dt>
  <dd>(W illegalproto) An illegal character was found in a prototype
      declaration. The '_' in a prototype must be followed by a ';', indicating
      the rest of the parameters are optional, or one of '@' or '%', since those
      two will accept 0 or more final parameters.</dd>
  <dt>Illegal character \%o (carriage return)</dt>
  <dd>(F) Perl normally treats carriage returns in the program text as it would
      any other whitespace, which means you should never see this error when
      Perl was built using standard options. For some reason, your version of
      Perl appears to have been built without this support. Talk to your Perl
      administrator.</dd>
  <dt>Illegal character following sigil in a subroutine signature</dt>
  <dd>(F) A parameter in a subroutine signature contained an unexpected
      character following the <span class="Li">&quot;$&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;@&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;%&quot;</span> sigil character. Normally the sigil
      should be followed by the variable name or
      <span class="Li">&quot;=&quot;</span> etc. Perhaps you are trying use a
      prototype while in the scope of <span class="Li">&quot;use feature
      'signatures'&quot;</span>? For example:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    sub foo ($$) {}            # legal - a prototype

    use feature 'signatures;
    sub foo ($$) {}            # illegal - was expecting a signature
    sub foo ($a, $b)
            :prototype($$) {}  # legal
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>Illegal character in prototype for %s : %s</dt>
  <dd>(W illegalproto) An illegal character was found in a prototype
      declaration. Legal characters in prototypes are $, @, %, *, ;, [, ],
      &amp;, \, and +. Perhaps you were trying to write a subroutine signature
      but didn't enable that feature first (<span class="Li">&quot;use feature
      'signatures'&quot;</span>), so your signature was instead interpreted as a
      bad prototype.</dd>
  <dt>Illegal declaration of anonymous subroutine</dt>
  <dd>(F) When using the <span class="Li">&quot;sub&quot;</span> keyword to
      construct an anonymous subroutine, you must always specify a block of
      code. See perlsub.</dd>
  <dt>Illegal declaration of subroutine %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) A subroutine was not declared correctly. See perlsub.</dd>
  <dt>Illegal division by zero</dt>
  <dd>(F) You tried to divide a number by 0. Either something was wrong in your
      logic, or you need to put a conditional in to guard against meaningless
      input.</dd>
  <dt>Illegal hexadecimal digit %s ignored</dt>
  <dd>(W digit) You may have tried to use a character other than 0 - 9 or A - F,
      a - f in a hexadecimal number. Interpretation of the hexadecimal number
      stopped before the illegal character.</dd>
  <dt>Illegal modulus zero</dt>
  <dd>(F) You tried to divide a number by 0 to get the remainder. Most numbers
      don't take to this kindly.</dd>
  <dt>Illegal number of bits in vec</dt>
  <dd>(F) The number of bits in <b>vec()</b> (the third argument) must be a
      power of two from 1 to 32 (or 64, if your platform supports that).</dd>
  <dt>Illegal octal digit '%c'</dt>
  <dd>(F) You used an 8 or 9 in an octal number.</dd>
  <dt>Illegal octal digit %s ignored</dt>
  <dd>(W digit) You may have tried to use an 8 or 9 in an octal number.
      Interpretation of the octal number stopped before the 8 or 9.</dd>
  <dt>Illegal operator following parameter in a subroutine signature</dt>
  <dd>(F) A parameter in a subroutine signature, was followed by something other
      than <span class="Li">&quot;=&quot;</span> introducing a default,
      <span class="Li">&quot;,&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;)&quot;</span>.
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    use feature 'signatures';
    sub foo ($=1) {}           # legal
    sub foo ($a = 1) {}        # legal

  <dt>Illegal pattern in regex; marked by &lt;--&#x00A0;HERE in m/%s/</dt>
  <dd>(F) You wrote something like
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
 (?+foo)
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;+&quot;</span> is valid only when
        followed by digits, indicating a capturing group. See
        <span class="Li">&quot;(?</span><i>PARNO</i><span class="Li">)&quot;</span>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Illegal suidscript</dt>
  <dd>(F) The script run under suidperl was somehow illegal.</dd>
  <dt>Illegal switch in PERL5OPT: -%c</dt>
  <dd>(X) The PERL5OPT environment variable may only be used to set the
      following switches: <b>-[CDIMUdmtw]</b>.</dd>
  <dt>Illegal user-defined property name</dt>
  <dd>(F) You specified a Unicode-like property name in a regular expression
      pattern (using <span class="Li">&quot;\p{}&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;\P{}&quot;</span>) that Perl knows isn't an
      official Unicode property, and was likely meant to be a user-defined
      property name, but it can't be one of those, as they must begin with
      either <span class="Li">&quot;In&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;Is&quot;</span>. Check the spelling. See also
      &quot;Can't find Unicode property definition &quot;%s&quot;&quot;.</dd>
  <dt>Ill-formed CRTL environ value &quot;%s&quot;</dt>
  <dd>(W internal) A warning peculiar to VMS. Perl tried to read the CRTL's
      internal environ array, and encountered an element without the
      <span class="Li">&quot;=&quot;</span> delimiter used to separate keys from
      values. The element is ignored.</dd>
  <dt>Ill-formed message in prime_env_iter: |%s|</dt>
  <dd>(W internal) A warning peculiar to VMS. Perl tried to read a logical name
      or CLI symbol definition when preparing to iterate over
      <span class="Li">%ENV</span>, and didn't see the expected delimiter
      between key and value, so the line was ignored.</dd>
  <dt>(in cleanup) %s</dt>
  <dd>(W misc) This prefix usually indicates that a <b>DESTROY()</b> method
      raised the indicated exception. Since destructors are usually called by
      the system at arbitrary points during execution, and often a vast number
      of times, the warning is issued only once for any number of failures that
      would otherwise result in the same message being repeated.
    <p class="Pp">Failure of user callbacks dispatched using the
        <span class="Li">&quot;G_KEEPERR&quot;</span> flag could also result in
        this warning. See &quot;G_KEEPERR&quot; in perlcall.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Incomplete expression within '(?[ ])' in regex; marked by
    &lt;--&#x00A0;HERE in m/%s/</dt>
  <dd>(F) There was a syntax error within the <span class="Li">&quot;(?[
      ])&quot;</span>. This can happen if the expression inside the construct
      was completely empty, or if there are too many or few operands for the
      number of operators. Perl is not smart enough to give you a more precise
      indication as to what is wrong.</dd>
  <dt>Inconsistent hierarchy during C3 merge of class '%s': merging failed on
    parent '%s'</dt>
  <dd>(F) The method resolution order (MRO) of the given class is not
      C3-consistent, and you have enabled the C3 MRO for this class. See the C3
      documentation in mro for more information.</dd>
  <dt>Indentation on line %d of here-doc doesn't match delimiter</dt>
  <dd>(F) You have an indented here-document where one or more of its lines have
      whitespace at the beginning that does not match the closing delimiter.
    <p class="Pp">For example, line 2 below is wrong because it does not have at
        least 2 spaces, but lines 1 and 3 are fine because they have at least
      2:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    if ($something) {
      print &lt;&lt;~EOF;
        Line 1
       Line 2 not
          Line 3
        EOF
    }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Note that tabs and spaces are compared strictly, meaning 1 tab
        will not match 8 spaces.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Infinite recursion in regex</dt>
  <dd>(F) You used a pattern that references itself without consuming any input
      text. You should check the pattern to ensure that recursive patterns
      either consume text or fail.</dd>
  <dt>Infinite recursion via empty pattern</dt>
  <dd>(F) You tried to use the empty pattern inside of a regex code block, for
      instance <span class="Li">&quot;/(?{ s!!! })/&quot;</span>, which resulted
      in re-executing the same pattern, which is an infinite loop which is
      broken by throwing an exception.</dd>
  <dt>Initialization of state variables in list currently forbidden</dt>
  <dd>(F) <span class="Li">&quot;state&quot;</span> only permits initializing a
      single variable, specified without parentheses. So
      <span class="Li">&quot;state $a = 42&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;state @a = qw(a b c)&quot;</span> are allowed, but
      not <span class="Li">&quot;state ($a) = 42&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;(state $a) = 42&quot;</span>. To initialize more
      than one <span class="Li">&quot;state&quot;</span> variable, initialize
      them one at a time.</dd>
  <dt>%%s[%s] in scalar context better written as $%s[%s]</dt>
  <dd>(W syntax) In scalar context, you've used an array index/value slice
      (indicated by %) to select a single element of an array. Generally it's
      better to ask for a scalar value (indicated by $). The difference is that
      <span class="Li">$foo[&amp;bar]</span> always behaves like a scalar, both
      in the value it returns and when evaluating its argument, while
      <span class="Li">%foo[&amp;bar]</span> provides a list context to its
      subscript, which can do weird things if you're expecting only one
      subscript. When called in list context, it also returns the index (what
      <span class="Li">&amp;bar</span> returns) in addition to the value.</dd>
  <dt>%%s{%s} in scalar context better written as $%s{%s}</dt>
  <dd>(W syntax) In scalar context, you've used a hash key/value slice
      (indicated by %) to select a single element of a hash. Generally it's
      better to ask for a scalar value (indicated by $). The difference is that
      <span class="Li">$foo{&amp;bar}</span> always behaves like a scalar, both
      in the value it returns and when evaluating its argument, while
      <span class="Li">@foo{&amp;bar}</span> and provides a list context to its
      subscript, which can do weird things if you're expecting only one
      subscript. When called in list context, it also returns the key in
      addition to the value.</dd>
  <dt>Insecure dependency in %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) You tried to do something that the tainting mechanism didn't like. The
      tainting mechanism is turned on when you're running setuid or setgid, or
      when you specify <b>-T</b> to turn it on explicitly. The tainting
      mechanism labels all data that's derived directly or indirectly from the
      user, who is considered to be unworthy of your trust. If any such data is
      used in a &quot;dangerous&quot; operation, you get this error. See perlsec
      for more information.</dd>
  <dt>Insecure directory in %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) You can't use <b>system()</b>, <b>exec()</b>, or a piped open in a
      setuid or setgid script if <span class="Li">$ENV{PATH}</span> contains a
      directory that is writable by the world. Also, the PATH must not contain
      any relative directory. See perlsec.</dd>
  <dt>Insecure $ENV{%s} while running %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) You can't use <b>system()</b>, <b>exec()</b>, or a piped open in a
      setuid or setgid script if any of <span class="Li">$ENV{PATH}</span>,
      <span class="Li">$ENV{IFS}</span>, <span class="Li">$ENV{CDPATH}</span>,
      <span class="Li">$ENV{ENV}</span>, <span class="Li">$ENV{BASH_ENV}</span>
      or <span class="Li">$ENV{TERM}</span> are derived from data supplied (or
      potentially supplied) by the user. The script must set the path to a known
      value, using trustworthy data. See perlsec.</dd>
  <dt>Insecure user-defined property %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) Perl detected tainted data when trying to compile a regular expression
      that contains a call to a user-defined character property function, i.e.
      <span class="Li">&quot;\p{IsFoo}&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;\p{InFoo}&quot;</span>. See &quot;User-Defined
      Character Properties&quot; in perlunicode and perlsec.</dd>
  <dt>Integer overflow in format string for %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) The indexes and widths specified in the format string of
      <span class="Li">&quot;printf()&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;sprintf()&quot;</span> are too large. The numbers
      must not overflow the size of integers for your architecture.</dd>
  <dt>Integer overflow in %s number</dt>
  <dd>(S overflow) The hexadecimal, octal or binary number you have specified
      either as a literal or as an argument to <b>hex()</b> or <b>oct()</b> is
      too big for your architecture, and has been converted to a floating point
      number. On a 32-bit architecture the largest hexadecimal, octal or binary
      number representable without overflow is 0xFFFFFFFF, 037777777777, or
      0b11111111111111111111111111111111 respectively. Note that Perl
      transparently promotes all numbers to a floating point representation
      internally--subject to loss of precision errors in subsequent
    operations.</dd>
  <dt>Integer overflow in srand</dt>
  <dd>(S overflow) The number you have passed to srand is too big to fit in your
      architecture's integer representation. The number has been replaced with
      the largest integer supported (0xFFFFFFFF on 32-bit architectures). This
      means you may be getting less randomness than you expect, because
      different random seeds above the maximum will return the same sequence of
      random numbers.</dd>
  <dt>Integer overflow in version</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>Integer overflow in version %d</dt>
  <dd>(W overflow) Some portion of a version initialization is too large for the
      size of integers for your architecture. This is not a warning because
      there is no rational reason for a version to try and use an element larger
      than typically 2**32. This is usually caused by trying to use some odd
      mathematical operation as a version, like 100/9.</dd>
  <dt>Internal disaster in regex; marked by &lt;--&#x00A0;HERE in m/%s/</dt>
  <dd>(P) Something went badly wrong in the regular expression parser. The
      &lt;--&#x00A0;HERE shows whereabouts in the regular expression the problem
      was discovered.</dd>
  <dt>Internal inconsistency in tracking vforks</dt>
  <dd>(S) A warning peculiar to VMS. Perl keeps track of the number of times
      you've called <span class="Li">&quot;fork&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;exec&quot;</span>, to determine whether the current
      call to <span class="Li">&quot;exec&quot;</span> should affect the current
      script or a subprocess (see &quot;exec LIST&quot; in perlvms). Somehow,
      this count has become scrambled, so Perl is making a guess and treating
      this <span class="Li">&quot;exec&quot;</span> as a request to terminate
      the Perl script and execute the specified command.</dd>
  <dt>internal %&lt;num&gt;p might conflict with future printf extensions</dt>
  <dd>(S internal) Perl's internal routine that handles
      <span class="Li">&quot;printf&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;sprintf&quot;</span> formatting follows a slightly
      different set of rules when called from C or XS code. Specifically,
      formats consisting of digits followed by &quot;p&quot; (e.g.,
      &quot;%7p&quot;) are reserved for future use. If you see this message,
      then an XS module tried to call that routine with one such reserved
      format.</dd>

  <dt>%s (...) interpreted as function</dt>
  <dd>(W syntax) You've run afoul of the rule that says that any list operator
      followed by parentheses turns into a function, with all the list operators
      arguments found inside the parentheses. See &quot;Terms and List Operators
      (Leftward)&quot; in perlop.</dd>
  <dt>In '(?...)', the '(' and '?' must be adjacent in regex; marked by

  <dd>(F) The two-character sequence <span class="Li">&quot;(?&quot;</span> in
      this context in a regular expression pattern should be an indivisible
      token, with nothing intervening between the
      <span class="Li">&quot;(&quot;</span> and the

      token, with nothing intervening between the
      <span class="Li">&quot;(&quot;</span> and the

  <dt>Invalid %s attribute: %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) The indicated attribute for a subroutine or variable was not
      recognized by Perl or by a user-supplied handler. See attributes.</dd>
  <dt>Invalid %s attributes: %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) The indicated attributes for a subroutine or variable were not

  <dt>Invalid character in charnames alias definition; marked by
    &lt;--&#x00A0;HERE in '%s</dt>
  <dd>(F) You tried to create a custom alias for a character name, with the
      <span class="Li">&quot;:alias&quot;</span> option to
      <span class="Li">&quot;use charnames&quot;</span> and the specified
      character in the indicated name isn't valid. See &quot;CUSTOM
      ALIASES&quot; in charnames.</dd>
  <dt>Invalid \0 character in %s for %s: %s\0%s</dt>
  <dd>(W syscalls) Embedded \0 characters in pathnames or other system call
      arguments produce a warning as of 5.20. The parts after the \0 were
      formerly ignored by system calls.</dd>
  <dt>Invalid character in \N{...}; marked by &lt;--&#x00A0;HERE in \N{%s}</dt>
  <dd>(F) Only certain characters are valid for character names. The indicated
      one isn't. See &quot;CUSTOM ALIASES&quot; in charnames.</dd>
  <dt>Invalid conversion in %s: &quot;%s&quot;</dt>
  <dd>(W printf) Perl does not understand the given format conversion. See

  <dt>Invalid escape in the specified encoding in regex; marked by
    &lt;--&#x00A0;HERE in m/%s/</dt>
  <dd>(W regexp)(F) The numeric escape (for example
      <span class="Li">&quot;\xHH&quot;</span>) of value &lt; 256 didn't
      correspond to a single character through the conversion from the encoding
      specified by the encoding pragma. The escape was replaced with REPLACEMENT
      CHARACTER (U+FFFD) instead, except within
      <span class="Li">&quot;(?[&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;])&quot;</span>, where
      it is a fatal error. The &lt;--&#x00A0;HERE shows whereabouts in the

  <dt>Invalid hexadecimal number in \N{U+...}</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>Invalid hexadecimal number in \N{U+...} in regex; marked by
    &lt;--&#x00A0;HERE in m/%s/</dt>
  <dd>(F) The character constant represented by

      Either it is empty, or you tried to use a character other than 0 - 9 or A
      - F, a - f in a hexadecimal number.</dd>
  <dt>Invalid module name %s with -%c option: contains single ':'</dt>
  <dd>(F) The module argument to perl's <b>-m</b> and <b>-M</b> command-line
      options cannot contain single colons in the module name, but only in the
      arguments after &quot;=&quot;. In other words, <b>-MFoo::Bar=:baz</b> is
      ok, but <b>-MFoo:Bar=baz</b> is not.</dd>
  <dt>Invalid mro name: '%s'</dt>
  <dd>(F) You tried to

      &quot;foo&quot;)&quot;</span> or <span class="Li">&quot;use mro
      'foo'&quot;</span>, where <span class="Li">&quot;foo&quot;</span> is not a
      valid method resolution order (MRO). Currently, the only valid ones
      supported are <span class="Li">&quot;dfs&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;c3&quot;</span>, unless you have loaded a module
      that is a MRO plugin. See mro and perlmroapi.</dd>
  <dt>Invalid negative number (%s) in chr</dt>
  <dd>(W utf8) You passed a negative number to
      <span class="Li">&quot;chr&quot;</span>. Negative numbers are not valid
      character numbers, so it returns the Unicode replacement character
      (U+FFFD).</dd>
  <dt>Invalid number '%s' for -C option.</dt>
  <dd>(F) You supplied a number to the -C option that either has extra leading
      zeroes or overflows perl's unsigned integer representation.</dd>
  <dt>invalid option -D%c, use -D'' to see choices</dt>
  <dd>(S debugging) Perl was called with invalid debugger flags. Call perl with

  <dt>Invalid quantifier in {,} in regex; marked by &lt;--&#x00A0;HERE in
    m/%s/</dt>
  <dd>(F) The pattern looks like a {min,max} quantifier, but the min or max
      could not be parsed as a valid number - either it has leading zeroes, or
      it represents too big a number to cope with. The &lt;--&#x00A0;HERE shows
      where in the regular expression the problem was discovered. See
    perlre.</dd>
  <dt>Invalid [] range &quot;%s&quot; in regex; marked by &lt;--&#x00A0;HERE in

      <span class="Li">&quot;{}&quot;</span> from your ending
      <span class="Li">&quot;\x{}&quot;</span> -
      <span class="Li">&quot;\x&quot;</span> without the curly braces can go
      only up to <span class="Li">&quot;ff&quot;</span>. The &lt;--&#x00A0;HERE
      shows whereabouts in the regular expression the problem was discovered.

  <dt>Invalid range &quot;%s&quot; in transliteration operator</dt>
  <dd>(F) The range specified in the tr/// or y/// operator had a minimum
      character greater than the maximum character. See perlop.</dd>
  <dt>Invalid separator character %s in attribute list</dt>
  <dd>(F) Something other than a colon or whitespace was seen between the
      elements of an attribute list. If the previous attribute had a
      parenthesised parameter list, perhaps that list was terminated too soon.
      See attributes.</dd>
  <dt>Invalid separator character %s in PerlIO layer specification %s</dt>
  <dd>(W layer) When pushing layers onto the Perl I/O system, something other
      than a colon or whitespace was seen between the elements of a layer list.
      If the previous attribute had a parenthesised parameter list, perhaps that
      list was terminated too soon.</dd>
  <dt>Invalid strict version format (%s)</dt>
  <dd>(F) A version number did not meet the &quot;strict&quot; criteria for
      versions. A &quot;strict&quot; version number is a positive decimal number
      (integer or decimal-fraction) without exponentiation or else a
      dotted-decimal v-string with a leading 'v' character and at least three
      components. The parenthesized text indicates which criteria were not met.
      See the version module for more details on allowed version formats.</dd>
  <dt>Invalid type '%s' in %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) The given character is not a valid pack or unpack type. See
      &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.
    <p class="Pp">(W) The given character is not a valid pack or unpack type but
        used to be silently ignored.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Invalid version format (%s)</dt>
  <dd>(F) A version number did not meet the &quot;lax&quot; criteria for
      versions. A &quot;lax&quot; version number is a positive decimal number
      (integer or decimal-fraction) without exponentiation or else a
      dotted-decimal v-string. If the v-string has fewer than three components,
      it must have a leading 'v' character. Otherwise, the leading 'v' is
      optional. Both decimal and dotted-decimal versions may have a trailing
      &quot;alpha&quot; component separated by an underscore character after a
      fractional or dotted-decimal component. The parenthesized text indicates
      which criteria were not met. See the version module for more details on
      allowed version formats.</dd>
  <dt>Invalid version object</dt>
  <dd>(F) The internal structure of the version object was invalid. Perhaps the

  <dt>Locale '%s' contains (at least) the following characters which have
    unexpected meanings: %s The Perl program will use the expected meanings</dt>
  <dd>(W locale) You are using the named UTF-8 locale. UTF-8 locales are
      expected to have very particular behavior, which most do. This message
      arises when perl found some departures from the expectations, and is
      notifying you that the expected behavior overrides these differences. In
      some cases the differences are caused by the locale definition being
      defective, but the most common causes of this warning are when there are
      ambiguities and conflicts in following the Standard, and the locale has
      chosen an approach that differs from Perl's.
    <p class="Pp">One of these is because that, contrary to the claims, Unicode
        is not completely locale insensitive. Turkish and some related languages
        have two types of <span class="Li">&quot;I&quot;</span> characters. One
        is dotted in both upper- and lowercase, and the other is dotless in both
        cases. Unicode allows a locale to use either the Turkish rules, or the
        rules used in all other instances, where there is only one type of
        <span class="Li">&quot;I&quot;</span>, which is dotless in the
        uppercase, and dotted in the lower. The perl core does not (yet) handle
        the Turkish case, and this message warns you of that. Instead, the
        Unicode::Casing module allows you to mostly implement the Turkish casing
        rules.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The other common cause is for the characters</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
 $ + &lt; = &gt; ^ ` | ~
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">These are probematic. The C standard says that these should be
        considered punctuation in the C locale (and the POSIX standard defers to
        the C standard), and Unicode is generally considered a superset of the C
        locale. But Unicode has added an extra category, &quot;Symbol&quot;, and
        classifies these particular characters as being symbols. Most UTF-8
        locales have them treated as punctuation, so that <b>ispunct</b>(2)
        returns non-zero for them. But a few locales have it return 0. Perl
        takes the first approach, not using
        <span class="Li">&quot;ispunct()&quot;</span> at all (see Note [5] in
        perlrecharclass), and this message is raised to notify you that you are
        getting Perl's approach, not the locale's.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Locale '%s' may not work well.%s</dt>
  <dd>(W locale) You are using the named locale, which is a non-UTF-8 one, and
      which perl has determined is not fully compatible with what it can handle.
      The second <span class="Li">%s</span> gives a reason.
    <p class="Pp">By far the most common reason is that the locale has
        characters in it that are represented by more than one byte. The only
        such locales that Perl can handle are the UTF-8 locales. Most likely the
        specified locale is a non-UTF-8 one for an East Asian language such as
        Chinese or Japanese. If the locale is a superset of ASCII, the ASCII
        portion of it may work in Perl.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Some essentially obsolete locales that aren't supersets of
        ASCII, mainly those in ISO 646 or other 7-bit locales, such as ASMO 449,
        can also have problems, depending on what portions of the ASCII
        character set get changed by the locale and are also used by the
        program. The warning message lists the determinable conflicting
        characters.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that not all incompatibilities are found.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If this happens to you, there's not much you can do except
        switch to use a different locale or use Encode to translate from the
        locale into UTF-8; if that's impracticable, you have been warned that
        some things may break.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This message is output once each time a bad locale is switched
        into within the scope of
        <span class="Li">&quot;use&#x00A0;locale&quot;</span>, or on the first
        possibly-affected operation if the
        <span class="Li">&quot;use&#x00A0;locale&quot;</span> inherits a bad
        one. It is not raised for any operations from the POSIX module.</p>

  <dt>Malformed prototype for %s: %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) You tried to use a function with a malformed prototype. The syntax of
      function prototypes is given a brief compile-time check for obvious errors
      like invalid characters. A more rigorous check is run when the function is
      called. Perhaps the function's author was trying to write a subroutine
      signature but didn't enable that feature first (<span class="Li">&quot;use
      feature 'signatures'&quot;</span>), so the signature was instead
      interpreted as a bad prototype.</dd>
  <dt>Malformed UTF-8 character%s</dt>
  <dd>(S utf8)(F) Perl detected a string that should be UTF-8, but didn't comply
      with UTF-8 encoding rules, or represents a code point whose ordinal
      integer value doesn't fit into the word size of the current platform
      (overflows). Details as to the exact malformation are given in the
      variable, <span class="Li">%s</span>, part of the message.
    <p class="Pp">One possible cause is that you set the UTF8 flag yourself for
        data that you thought to be in UTF-8 but it wasn't (it was for example
        legacy 8-bit data). To guard against this, you can use
        <span class="Li">&quot;Encode::decode('UTF-8', ...)&quot;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you use the

      a later one mandatory. Parameters are filled from left to right, so it's
      impossible for the caller to omit an earlier one and pass a later one. If
      you want to act as if the parameters are filled from right to left,
      declare the rightmost optional and then shuffle the parameters around in
      the subroutine's body.</dd>
  <dt>Matched non-Unicode code point 0x%X against Unicode property; may not be
    portable</dt>
  <dd>(S non_unicode) Perl allows strings to contain a superset of Unicode code
      points; each code point may be as large as what is storable in a signed
      integer on your system, but these may not be accepted by other
      languages/systems. This message occurs when you matched a string
      containing such a code point against a regular expression pattern, and the
      code point was matched against a Unicode property,
      <span class="Li">&quot;\p{...}&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;\P{...}&quot;</span>. Unicode properties are only
      defined on Unicode code points, so the result of this match is undefined
      by Unicode, but Perl (starting in v5.20) treats non-Unicode code points as
      if they were typical unassigned Unicode ones, and matched this one
      accordingly. Whether a given property matches these code points or not is
      specified in &quot;Properties accessible through \p{} and \P{}&quot; in
      perluniprops.
    <p class="Pp">This message is suppressed (unless it has been made fatal) if
        it is immaterial to the results of the match if the code point is
        Unicode or not. For example, the property
        <span class="Li">&quot;\p{ASCII_Hex_Digit}&quot;</span> only can match
        the 22 characters <span class="Li">&quot;[0-9A-Fa-f]&quot;</span>, so
        obviously all other code points, Unicode or not, won't match it. (And
        <span class="Li">&quot;\P{ASCII_Hex_Digit}&quot;</span> will match every
        code point except these 22.)</p>
    <p class="Pp">Getting this message indicates that the outcome of the match
        arguably should have been the opposite of what actually happened. If you
        think that is the case, you may wish to make the
        <span class="Li">&quot;non_unicode&quot;</span> warnings category fatal;
        if you agree with Perl's decision, you may wish to turn off this

  <dt>Missing right brace on \%c{} in regex; marked by &lt;--&#x00A0;HERE in

  <dd>(F) Missing right brace in <span class="Li">&quot;\x{...}&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;\p{...}&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;\P{...}&quot;</span>, or

  <dt>Missing right brace on \N{}</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>Missing right brace on \N{} or unescaped left brace after \N</dt>
  <dd>(F) <span class="Li">&quot;\N&quot;</span> has two meanings.
    <p class="Pp">The traditional one has it followed by a name enclosed in
        braces, meaning the character (or sequence of characters) given by that
        name. Thus <span class="Li">&quot;\N{ASTERISK}&quot;</span> is another
        way of writing <span class="Li">&quot;*&quot;</span>, valid in both
        double-quoted strings and regular expression patterns. In patterns, it
        doesn't have the meaning an unescaped
        <span class="Li">&quot;*&quot;</span> does.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Starting in Perl 5.12.0,
        <span class="Li">&quot;\N&quot;</span> also can have an additional
        meaning (only) in patterns, namely to match a non-newline character.
        (This is short for <span class="Li">&quot;[^\n]&quot;</span>, and like
        <span class="Li">&quot;.&quot;</span> but is not affected by the
        <span class="Li">&quot;/s&quot;</span> regex modifier.)</p>
    <p class="Pp">This can lead to some ambiguities. When
        <span class="Li">&quot;\N&quot;</span> is not followed immediately by a
        left brace, Perl assumes the <span class="Li">&quot;[^\n]&quot;</span>
        meaning. Also, if the braces form a valid quantifier such as
        <span class="Li">&quot;\N{3}&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;\N{5,}&quot;</span>, Perl assumes that this means
        to match the given quantity of non-newlines (in these examples, 3; and 5
        or more, respectively). In all other case, where there is a
        <span class="Li">&quot;\N{&quot;</span> and a matching
        <span class="Li">&quot;}&quot;</span>, Perl assumes that a character
        name is desired.</p>
    <p class="Pp">However, if there is no matching
        <span class="Li">&quot;}&quot;</span>, Perl doesn't know if it was
        mistakenly omitted, or if <span class="Li">&quot;[^\n]{&quot;</span> was
        desired, and raises this error. If you meant the former, add the right
        brace; if you meant the latter, escape the brace with a backslash, like
        so: <span class="Li">&quot;\N\{&quot;</span></p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Missing right curly or square bracket</dt>
  <dd>(F) The lexer counted more opening curly or square brackets than closing
      ones. As a general rule, you'll find it's missing near the place you were
      last editing.</dd>
  <dt>(Missing semicolon on previous line?)</dt>
  <dd>(S syntax) This is an educated guess made in conjunction with the message
      &quot;%s found where operator expected&quot;. Don't automatically put a
      semicolon on the previous line just because you saw this message.</dd>
  <dt>Modification of a read-only value attempted</dt>
  <dd>(F) You tried, directly or indirectly, to change the value of a constant.
      You didn't, of course, try &quot;2 = 1&quot;, because the compiler catches
      that. But an easy way to do the same thing is:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    sub mod { $_[0] = 1 }
    mod(2);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Another way is to assign to a <b>substr()</b> that's off the
        end of the string.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Yet another way is to assign to a
        <span class="Li">&quot;foreach&quot;</span> loop <i>VAR</i> when
        <i>VAR</i> is aliased to a constant in the look <i>LIST</i>:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    $x = 1;
    foreach my $n ($x, 2) {

    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>Modification of non-creatable array value attempted, %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) You tried to make an array value spring into existence, and the
      subscript was probably negative, even counting from end of the array
      backwards.</dd>
  <dt>Modification of non-creatable hash value attempted, %s</dt>
  <dd>(P) You tried to make a hash value spring into existence, and it couldn't
      be created for some peculiar reason.</dd>
  <dt>Module name must be constant</dt>
  <dd>(F) Only a bare module name is allowed as the first argument to a
      &quot;use&quot;.</dd>
  <dt>Module name required with -%c option</dt>
  <dd>(F) The <span class="Li">&quot;-M&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;-m&quot;</span> options say that Perl should load
      some module, but you omitted the name of the module. Consult perlrun for
      full details about <span class="Li">&quot;-M&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;-m&quot;</span>.</dd>
  <dt>More than one argument to '%s' open</dt>
  <dd>(F) The <span class="Li">&quot;open&quot;</span> function has been asked
      to open multiple files. This can happen if you are trying to open a pipe
      to a command that takes a list of arguments, but have forgotten to specify
      a piped open mode. See &quot;open&quot; in perlfunc for details.</dd>

  <dt>Multiple slurpy parameters not allowed</dt>
  <dd>(F) In subroutine signatures, a slurpy parameter
      (<span class="Li">&quot;@&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;%&quot;</span>) must be the last parameter, and
      there must not be more than one of them; for example:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    sub foo ($a, @b)    {} # legal
    sub foo ($a, @b, %) {} # invalid

  <dt>'/' must follow a numeric type in unpack</dt>
  <dd>(F) You had an unpack template that contained a '/', but this did not
      follow some unpack specification producing a numeric value. See
      &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt>%s must not be a named sequence in transliteration operator</dt>
  <dd>(F) Transliteration (<span class="Li">&quot;tr///&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;y///&quot;</span>) transliterates individual
      characters. But a named sequence by definition is more than an individual
      character, and hence doing this operation on it doesn't make sense.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;my sub&quot; not yet implemented</dt>
  <dd>(F) Lexically scoped subroutines are not yet implemented. Don't try that
      yet.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;my&quot; subroutine %s can't be in a package</dt>
  <dd>(F) Lexically scoped subroutines aren't in a package, so it doesn't make
      sense to try to declare one with a package qualifier on the front.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;my %s&quot; used in sort comparison</dt>
  <dd>(W syntax) The package variables <span class="Li">$a</span> and
      <span class="Li">$b</span> are used for sort comparisons. You used
      <span class="Li">$a</span> or <span class="Li">$b</span> in as an operand
      to the <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;=&gt;&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;cmp&quot;</span> operator inside a sort comparison
      block, and the variable had earlier been declared as a lexical variable.
      Either qualify the sort variable with the package name, or rename the
      lexical variable.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;my&quot; variable %s can't be in a package</dt>
  <dd>(F) Lexically scoped variables aren't in a package, so it doesn't make
      sense to try to declare one with a package qualifier on the front. Use
      <b>local()</b> if you want to localize a package variable.</dd>
  <dt>Name &quot;%s::%s&quot; used only once: possible typo</dt>
  <dd>(W once) Typographical errors often show up as unique variable names. If
      you had a good reason for having a unique name, then just mention it again
      somehow to suppress the message. The
      <span class="Li">&quot;our&quot;</span> declaration is also provided for
      this purpose.
    <p class="Pp">NOTE: This warning detects package symbols that have been used
        only once. This means lexical variables will never trigger this warning.
        It also means that all of the package variables
        <span class="Li">$c</span>, <span class="Li">@c</span>,
        <span class="Li">%c</span>, as well as *c, &amp;c, sub c{}, c(), and c
        (the filehandle or format) are considered the same; if a program uses
        <span class="Li">$c</span> only once but also uses any of the others it
        will not trigger this warning. Symbols beginning with an underscore and
        symbols using special identifiers (q.v. perldata) are exempt from this
        warning.</p>

  <dd>(F) Within
      <span class="Li">&quot;(?[&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;])&quot;</span>, all
      constants interpreted as octal need to be exactly 3 digits long. This
      helps catch some ambiguities. If your constant is too short, add leading

        separate them:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
 (?[ [ \7776 ] ])        # Syntax error!
 (?[ [ \o{7776} ] ])     # One meaning

  <dt>Negative length</dt>
  <dd>(F) You tried to do a read/write/send/recv operation with a buffer length
      that is less than 0. This is difficult to imagine.</dd>
  <dt>Negative offset to vec in lvalue context</dt>
  <dd>(F) When <span class="Li">&quot;vec&quot;</span> is called in an lvalue
      context, the second argument must be greater than or equal to zero.</dd>
  <dt>Negative repeat count does nothing</dt>
  <dd>(W numeric) You tried to execute the <span class="Li">&quot;x&quot;</span>
      repetition operator fewer than 0 times, which doesn't make sense.</dd>
  <dt>Nested quantifiers in regex; marked by &lt;--&#x00A0;HERE in m/%s/</dt>
  <dd>(F) You can't quantify a quantifier without intervening parentheses. So
      things like ** or +* or ?* are illegal. The &lt;--&#x00A0;HERE shows
      whereabouts in the regular expression the problem was discovered.
    <p class="Pp">Note that the minimal matching quantifiers,
        <span class="Li">&quot;*?&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;+?&quot;</span>, and
        <span class="Li">&quot;??&quot;</span> appear to be nested quantifiers,

  <dt>next::method/next::can/maybe::next::method cannot find enclosing

  <dd>(F) <span class="Li">&quot;next::method&quot;</span> needs to be called

  <dt>\N in a character class must be a named character: \N{...} in regex;
    marked by &lt;--&#x00A0;HERE in m/%s/</dt>
  <dd>(F) The new (as of Perl 5.12) meaning of
      <span class="Li">&quot;\N&quot;</span> as
      <span class="Li">&quot;[^\n]&quot;</span> is not valid in a bracketed
      character class, for the same reason that
      <span class="Li">&quot;.&quot;</span> in a character class loses its
      specialness: it matches almost everything, which is probably not what you
      want.</dd>
  <dt>\N{} in inverted character class or as a range end-point is restricted to
    one character in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/</dt>
  <dd>(F) Named Unicode character escapes
      (<span class="Li">&quot;\N{...}&quot;</span>) may return a multi-character
      sequence. Even though a character class is supposed to match just one
      character of input, perl will match the whole thing correctly, except when
      the class is inverted (<span class="Li">&quot;[^...]&quot;</span>), or the
      escape is the beginning or final end point of a range. The mathematically
      logical behavior for what matches when inverting is very different from
      what people expect, so we have decided to forbid it. Similarly unclear is
      what should be generated when the
      <span class="Li">&quot;\N{...}&quot;</span> is used as one of the end
      points of the range, such as in
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
 [\x{41}-\N{ARABIC SEQUENCE YEH WITH HAMZA ABOVE WITH AE}]
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">What is meant here is unclear, as the
        <span class="Li">&quot;\N{...}&quot;</span> escape is a sequence of code
        points, so this is made an error.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>\N{NAME} must be resolved by the lexer in regex; marked by
    &lt;--&#x00A0;HERE in m/%s/</dt>
  <dd>(F) When compiling a regex pattern, an unresolved named character or
      sequence was encountered. This can happen in any of several ways that
      bypass the lexer, such as using single-quotish context, or an extra
      backslash in double-quotish:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    $re = '\N{SPACE}';  # Wrong!
    $re = &quot;\\N{SPACE}&quot;; # Wrong!
    /$re/;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Instead, use double-quotes with a single backslash:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    $re = &quot;\N{SPACE}&quot;;  # ok
    /$re/;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The lexer can be bypassed as well by creating the pattern from
        smaller components:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    $re = '\N';
    /${re}{SPACE}/;     # Wrong!
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">It's not a good idea to split a construct in the middle like
        this, and it doesn't work here. Instead use the solution above.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Finally, the message also can happen under the
        <span class="Li">&quot;/x&quot;</span> regex modifier when the
        <span class="Li">&quot;\N&quot;</span> is separated by spaces from the
        <span class="Li">&quot;{&quot;</span>, in which case, remove the
      spaces.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>

  <dt>No %s allowed while running setuid</dt>
  <dd>(F) Certain operations are deemed to be too insecure for a setuid or
      setgid script to even be allowed to attempt. Generally speaking there will
      be another way to do what you want that is, if not secure, at least
      securable. See perlsec.</dd>
  <dt>No code specified for -%c</dt>
  <dd>(F) Perl's <b>-e</b> and <b>-E</b> command-line options require an
      argument. If you want to run an empty program, pass the empty string as a
      separate argument or run a program consisting of a single 0 or 1:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>

    perl -e0
    perl -e1
    </pre>

  <dt>No comma allowed after %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) A list operator that has a filehandle or &quot;indirect object&quot;
      is not allowed to have a comma between that and the following arguments.
      Otherwise it'd be just another one of the arguments.
    <p class="Pp">One possible cause for this is that you expected to have
        imported a constant to your name space with <b>use</b> or <b>import</b>
        while no such importing took place, it may for example be that your
        operating system does not support that particular constant. Hopefully
        you did use an explicit import list for the constants you expect to see;
        please see &quot;use&quot; in perlfunc and &quot;import&quot; in
        perlfunc. While an explicit import list would probably have caught this
        error earlier it naturally does not remedy the fact that your operating
        system still does not support that constant. Maybe you have a typo in
        the constants of the symbol import list of <b>use</b> or <b>import</b>
        or in the constant name at the line where this error was triggered?</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>No command into which to pipe on command line</dt>
  <dd>(F) An error peculiar to VMS. Perl handles its own command line
      redirection, and found a '|' at the end of the command line, so it doesn't
      know where you want to pipe the output from this command.</dd>
  <dt>No DB::DB routine defined</dt>
  <dd>(F) The currently executing code was compiled with the <b>-d</b> switch,
      but for some reason the current debugger (e.g. <i>perl5db.pl</i> or a

      routine to be called at the beginning of each statement.</dd>
  <dt>No dbm on this machine</dt>
  <dd>(P) This is counted as an internal error, because every machine should
      supply dbm nowadays, because Perl comes with SDBM. See SDBM_File.</dd>
  <dt>No DB::sub routine defined</dt>
  <dd>(F) The currently executing code was compiled with the <b>-d</b> switch,
      but for some reason the current debugger (e.g. <i>perl5db.pl</i> or a
      <span class="Li">&quot;Devel::&quot;</span> module) didn't define a
      <span class="Li">&quot;DB::sub&quot;</span> routine to be called at the
      beginning of each ordinary subroutine call.</dd>
  <dt>No directory specified for -I</dt>
  <dd>(F) The <b>-I</b> command-line switch requires a directory name as part of
      the <i>same</i> argument. Use <b>-Ilib</b>, for instance. <b>-I lib</b>
      won't work.</dd>
  <dt>No error file after 2&gt; or 2&gt;&gt; on command line</dt>
  <dd>(F) An error peculiar to VMS. Perl handles its own command line
      redirection, and found a '2&gt;' or a '2&gt;&gt;' on the command line, but
      can't find the name of the file to which to write data destined for
      stderr.</dd>
  <dt>No group ending character '%c' found in template</dt>
  <dd>(F) A pack or unpack template has an opening '(' or '[' without its
      matching counterpart. See &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt>No input file after &lt; on command line</dt>
  <dd>(F) An error peculiar to VMS. Perl handles its own command line
      redirection, and found a '&lt;' on the command line, but can't find the
      name of the file from which to read data for stdin.</dd>
  <dt>No next::method '%s' found for %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) <span class="Li">&quot;next::method&quot;</span> found no further
      instances of this method name in the remaining packages of the MRO of this
      class. If you don't want it throwing an exception, use
      <span class="Li">&quot;maybe::next::method&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;next::can&quot;</span>. See mro.</dd>
  <dt>Non-finite repeat count does nothing</dt>
  <dd>(W numeric) You tried to execute the <span class="Li">&quot;x&quot;</span>
      repetition operator <span class="Li">&quot;Inf&quot;</span> (or
      <span class="Li">&quot;-Inf&quot;</span>) or
      <span class="Li">&quot;NaN&quot;</span> times, which doesn't make
    sense.</dd>
  <dt>Non-hex character in regex; marked by &lt;--&#x00A0;HERE in m/%s/</dt>
  <dd>(F) In a regular expression, there was a non-hexadecimal character where a
      hex one was expected, like
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
 (?[ [ \xDG ] ])
 (?[ [ \x{DEKA} ] ])
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>Non-octal character in regex; marked by &lt;--&#x00A0;HERE in m/%s/</dt>
  <dd>(F) In a regular expression, there was a non-octal character where an
      octal one was expected, like
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
 (?[ [ \o{1278} ] ])
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>Non-octal character '%c'. Resolved as &quot;%s&quot;</dt>
  <dd>(W digit) In parsing an octal numeric constant, a character was
      unexpectedly encountered that isn't octal. The resulting value is as
      indicated.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;no&quot; not allowed in expression</dt>
  <dd>(F) The &quot;no&quot; keyword is recognized and executed at compile time,
      and returns no useful value. See perlmod.</dd>
  <dt>Non-string passed as bitmask</dt>
  <dd>(W misc) A number has been passed as a bitmask argument to
      <b>select()</b>. Use the <b>vec()</b> function to construct the file
      descriptor bitmasks for select. See &quot;select&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt>No output file after &gt; on command line</dt>
  <dd>(F) An error peculiar to VMS. Perl handles its own command line
      redirection, and found a lone '&gt;' at the end of the command line, so it
      doesn't know where you wanted to redirect stdout.</dd>
  <dt>No output file after &gt; or &gt;&gt; on command line</dt>
  <dd>(F) An error peculiar to VMS. Perl handles its own command line
      redirection, and found a '&gt;' or a '&gt;&gt;' on the command line, but
      can't find the name of the file to which to write data destined for
      stdout.</dd>
  <dt>No package name allowed for subroutine %s in &quot;our&quot;</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>No package name allowed for variable %s in &quot;our&quot;</dt>
  <dd>(F) Fully qualified subroutine and variable names are not allowed in
      &quot;our&quot; declarations, because that doesn't make much sense under
      existing rules. Such syntax is reserved for future extensions.</dd>
  <dt>No Perl script found in input</dt>
  <dd>(F) You called <span class="Li">&quot;perl -x&quot;</span>, but no line
      was found in the file beginning with #! and containing the word
      &quot;perl&quot;.</dd>
  <dt>No setregid available</dt>
  <dd>(F) Configure didn't find anything resembling the <b>setregid()</b> call
      for your system.</dd>
  <dt>No setreuid available</dt>
  <dd>(F) Configure didn't find anything resembling the <b>setreuid()</b> call
      for your system.</dd>
  <dt>No such class %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) You provided a class qualifier in a &quot;my&quot;, &quot;our&quot; or
      &quot;state&quot; declaration, but this class doesn't exist at this point
      in your program.</dd>
  <dt>No such class field &quot;%s&quot; in variable %s of type %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) You tried to access a key from a hash through the indicated typed
      variable but that key is not allowed by the package of the same type. The
      indicated package has restricted the set of allowed keys using the fields
      pragma.</dd>
  <dt>No such hook: %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) You specified a signal hook that was not recognized by Perl.
      Currently, Perl accepts <span class="Li">&quot;__DIE__&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;__WARN__&quot;</span> as valid signal hooks.</dd>
  <dt>No such pipe open</dt>
  <dd>(P) An error peculiar to VMS. The internal routine <b>my_pclose()</b>
      tried to close a pipe which hadn't been opened. This should have been
      caught earlier as an attempt to close an unopened filehandle.</dd>
  <dt>No such signal: SIG%s</dt>
  <dd>(W signal) You specified a signal name as a subscript to
      <span class="Li">%SIG</span> that was not recognized. Say
      <span class="Li">&quot;kill -l&quot;</span> in your shell to see the valid
      signal names on your system.</dd>
  <dt>Not a CODE reference</dt>
  <dd>(F) Perl was trying to evaluate a reference to a code value (that is, a
      subroutine), but found a reference to something else instead. You can use
      the <b>ref()</b> function to find out what kind of ref it really was. See
      also perlref.</dd>
  <dt>Not a GLOB reference</dt>
  <dd>(F) Perl was trying to evaluate a reference to a &quot;typeglob&quot;
      (that is, a symbol table entry that looks like
      <span class="Li">*foo</span>), but found a reference to something else
      instead. You can use the <b>ref()</b> function to find out what kind of
      ref it really was. See perlref.</dd>
  <dt>Not a HASH reference</dt>
  <dd>(F) Perl was trying to evaluate a reference to a hash value, but found a
      reference to something else instead. You can use the <b>ref()</b> function
      to find out what kind of ref it really was. See perlref.</dd>
  <dt>'#' not allowed immediately following a sigil in a subroutine
    signature</dt>
  <dd>(F) In a subroutine signature definition, a comment following a sigil
      (<span class="Li">&quot;$&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;@&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;%&quot;</span>), needs to be separated by
      whitespace or a comma etc., in particular to avoid confusion with the
      <span class="Li">$#</span> variable. For example:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    # bad
    sub f ($# ignore first arg
           , $b) {}
    # good
    sub f ($, # ignore first arg
           $b) {}
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>Not an ARRAY reference</dt>
  <dd>(F) Perl was trying to evaluate a reference to an array value, but found a
      reference to something else instead. You can use the <b>ref()</b> function
      to find out what kind of ref it really was. See perlref.</dd>
  <dt>Not a SCALAR reference</dt>
  <dd>(F) Perl was trying to evaluate a reference to a scalar value, but found a
      reference to something else instead. You can use the <b>ref()</b> function
      to find out what kind of ref it really was. See perlref.</dd>
  <dt>Not a subroutine reference</dt>
  <dd>(F) Perl was trying to evaluate a reference to a code value (that is, a
      subroutine), but found a reference to something else instead. You can use
      the <b>ref()</b> function to find out what kind of ref it really was. See
      also perlref.</dd>
  <dt>Not a subroutine reference in overload table</dt>
  <dd>(F) An attempt was made to specify an entry in an overloading table that
      doesn't somehow point to a valid subroutine. See overload.</dd>
  <dt>Not enough arguments for %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) The function requires more arguments than you specified.</dd>
  <dt>Not enough format arguments</dt>
  <dd>(W syntax) A format specified more picture fields than the next line
      supplied. See perlform.</dd>
  <dt>%s: not found</dt>
  <dd>(A) You've accidentally run your script through the Bourne shell instead
      of Perl. Check the #! line, or manually feed your script into Perl
      yourself.</dd>
  <dt>(?[...]) not valid in locale in regex; marked by &lt;--&#x00A0;HERE in
    m/%s/</dt>
  <dd>(F) <span class="Li">&quot;(?[...])&quot;</span> cannot be used within the
      scope of a <span class="Li">&quot;use&#x00A0;locale&quot;</span> or with
      an <span class="Li">&quot;/l&quot;</span> regular expression modifier, as
      that would require deferring to run-time the calculation of what it should
      evaluate to, and it is regex compile-time only.</dd>
  <dt>no UTC offset information; assuming local time is UTC</dt>
  <dd>(S) A warning peculiar to VMS. Perl was unable to find the local timezone
      offset, so it's assuming that local system time is equivalent to UTC. If
      it's not, define the logical name <i>SYS$TIMEZONE_DIFFERENTIAL</i> to
      translate to the number of seconds which need to be added to UTC to get
      local time.</dd>
  <dt>NULL OP IN RUN</dt>
  <dd>(S debugging) Some internal routine called <b>run()</b> with a null opcode
      pointer.</dd>
  <dt>Null picture in formline</dt>
  <dd>(F) The first argument to formline must be a valid format picture
      specification. It was found to be empty, which probably means you supplied
      it an uninitialized value. See perlform.</dd>
  <dt>Null realloc</dt>
  <dd>(P) An attempt was made to realloc NULL.</dd>
  <dt>NULL regexp argument</dt>
  <dd>(P) The internal pattern matching routines blew it big time.</dd>
  <dt>NULL regexp parameter</dt>
  <dd>(P) The internal pattern matching routines are out of their gourd.</dd>
  <dt>Number too long</dt>
  <dd>(F) Perl limits the representation of decimal numbers in programs to about
      250 characters. You've exceeded that length. Future versions of Perl are
      likely to eliminate this arbitrary limitation. In the meantime, try using
      scientific notation (e.g. &quot;1e6&quot; instead of
      &quot;1_000_000&quot;).</dd>
  <dt>Number with no digits</dt>
  <dd>(F) Perl was looking for a number but found nothing that looked like a
      number. This happens, for example with
      <span class="Li">&quot;\o{}&quot;</span>, with no number between the
      braces.</dd>
  <dt>Octal number &gt; 037777777777 non-portable</dt>
  <dd>(W portable) The octal number you specified is larger than 2**32-1
      (4294967295) and therefore non-portable between systems. See perlport for
      more on portability concerns.</dd>
  <dt>Odd name/value argument for subroutine '%s'</dt>
  <dd>(F) A subroutine using a slurpy hash parameter in its signature received
      an odd number of arguments to populate the hash. It requires the arguments
      to be paired, with the same number of keys as values. The caller of the
      subroutine is presumably at fault.
    <p class="Pp">The message attempts to include the name of the called
        subroutine. If the subroutine has been aliased, the subroutine's
        original name will be shown, regardless of what name the caller
      used.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Odd number of arguments for overload::constant</dt>
  <dd>(W overload) The call to overload::constant contained an odd number of
      arguments. The arguments should come in pairs.</dd>
  <dt>Odd number of elements in anonymous hash</dt>
  <dd>(W misc) You specified an odd number of elements to initialize a hash,
      which is odd, because hashes come in key/value pairs.</dd>
  <dt>Odd number of elements in hash assignment</dt>
  <dd>(W misc) You specified an odd number of elements to initialize a hash,
      which is odd, because hashes come in key/value pairs.</dd>
  <dt>Offset outside string</dt>
  <dd>(F)(W layer) You tried to do a read/write/send/recv/seek operation with an
      offset pointing outside the buffer. This is difficult to imagine. The sole
      exceptions to this are that zero padding will take place when going past
      the end of the string when either
      <span class="Li">&quot;sysread()&quot;</span>ing a file, or when seeking
      past the end of a scalar opened for I/O (in anticipation of future reads
      and to imitate the behavior with real files).</dd>
  <dt>Old package separator used in string</dt>
  <dd>(W syntax) You used the old package separator, &quot;'&quot;, in a
      variable named inside a double-quoted string; e.g.,
      <span class="Li">&quot;In $name's house&quot;</span>. This is equivalent
      to <span class="Li">&quot;In $name::s house&quot;</span>. If you meant the
      former, put a backslash before the apostrophe (<span class="Li">&quot;In
      $name\'s house&quot;</span>).</dd>
  <dt>%s() on unopened %s</dt>
  <dd>(W unopened) An I/O operation was attempted on a filehandle that was never
      initialized. You need to do an <b>open()</b>, a <b>sysopen()</b>, or a
      <b>socket()</b> call, or call a constructor from the FileHandle
    package.</dd>
  <dt>-%s on unopened filehandle %s</dt>
  <dd>(W unopened) You tried to invoke a file test operator on a filehandle that
      isn't open. Check your control flow. See also &quot;-X&quot; in
    perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt>oops: oopsAV</dt>
  <dd>(S internal) An internal warning that the grammar is screwed up.</dd>
  <dt>oops: oopsHV</dt>
  <dd>(S internal) An internal warning that the grammar is screwed up.</dd>
  <dt>Operand with no preceding operator in regex; marked by &lt;--&#x00A0;HERE
    in m/%s/</dt>
  <dd>(F) You wrote something like
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
 (?[ \p{Digit} \p{Thai} ])
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">There are two operands, but no operator giving how you want to
        combine them.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Operation &quot;%s&quot;: no method found, %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) An attempt was made to perform an overloaded operation for which no
      handler was defined. While some handlers can be autogenerated in terms of
      other handlers, there is no default handler for any operation, unless the
      <span class="Li">&quot;fallback&quot;</span> overloading key is specified
      to be true. See overload.</dd>
  <dt>Operation &quot;%s&quot; returns its argument for non-Unicode code point
    0x%X</dt>
  <dd>(S non_unicode) You performed an operation requiring Unicode rules on a
      code point that is not in Unicode, so what it should do is not defined.
      Perl has chosen to have it do nothing, and warn you.
    <p class="Pp">If the operation shown is &quot;ToFold&quot;, it means that
        case-insensitive matching in a regular expression was done on the code
        point.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you know what you are doing you can turn off this warning
        by <span class="Li">&quot;no warnings 'non_unicode';&quot;</span>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Operation &quot;%s&quot; returns its argument for UTF-16 surrogate
    U+%X</dt>
  <dd>(S surrogate) You performed an operation requiring Unicode rules on a
      Unicode surrogate. Unicode frowns upon the use of surrogates for anything
      but storing strings in UTF-16, but rules are (reluctantly) defined for the
      surrogates, and they are to do nothing for this operation. Because the use
      of surrogates can be dangerous, Perl warns.
    <p class="Pp">If the operation shown is &quot;ToFold&quot;, it means that
        case-insensitive matching in a regular expression was done on the code
        point.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you know what you are doing you can turn off this warning
        by <span class="Li">&quot;no warnings 'surrogate';&quot;</span>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Operator or semicolon missing before %s</dt>
  <dd>(S ambiguous) You used a variable or subroutine call where the parser was
      expecting an operator. The parser has assumed you really meant to use an
      operator, but this is highly likely to be incorrect. For example, if you
      say &quot;*foo *foo&quot; it will be interpreted as if you said &quot;*foo
      * 'foo'&quot;.</dd>
  <dt>Optional parameter lacks default expression</dt>
  <dd>(F) In a subroutine signature, you wrote something like &quot;$a =&quot;,
      making a named optional parameter without a default value. A nameless
      optional parameter is permitted to have no default value, but a named one
      must have a specific default. You probably want &quot;$a =
    undef&quot;.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;our&quot; variable %s redeclared</dt>
  <dd>(W shadow) You seem to have already declared the same global once before
      in the current lexical scope.</dd>
  <dt>Out of memory!</dt>
  <dd>(X) The <b>malloc()</b> function returned 0, indicating there was
      insufficient remaining memory (or virtual memory) to satisfy the request.
      Perl has no option but to exit immediately.
    <p class="Pp">At least in Unix you may be able to get past this by
        increasing your process datasize limits: in csh/tcsh use
        <span class="Li">&quot;limit&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;limit datasize n&quot;</span> (where
        <span class="Li">&quot;n&quot;</span> is the number of kilobytes) to
        check the current limits and change them, and in ksh/bash/zsh use
        <span class="Li">&quot;ulimit -a&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;ulimit -d n&quot;</span>, respectively.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Out of memory during %s extend</dt>
  <dd>(X) An attempt was made to extend an array, a list, or a string beyond the
      largest possible memory allocation.</dd>
  <dt>Out of memory during &quot;large&quot; request for %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) The <b>malloc()</b> function returned 0, indicating there was
      insufficient remaining memory (or virtual memory) to satisfy the request.
      However, the request was judged large enough (compile-time default is
      64K), so a possibility to shut down by trapping this error is
    granted.</dd>
  <dt>Out of memory during request for %s</dt>
  <dd>(X)(F) The <b>malloc()</b> function returned 0, indicating there was
      insufficient remaining memory (or virtual memory) to satisfy the request.
    <p class="Pp">The request was judged to be small, so the possibility to trap
        it depends on the way perl was compiled. By default it is not trappable.
        However, if compiled for this, Perl may use the contents of
        <span class="Li">$^M</span> as an emergency pool after <b>die()</b>ing
        with this message. In this case the error is trappable <i>once</i>, and
        the error message will include the line and file where the failed
        request happened.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Out of memory during ridiculously large request</dt>
  <dd>(F) You can't allocate more than 2^31+&quot;small amount&quot; bytes. This
      error is most likely to be caused by a typo in the Perl program. e.g.,
      <span class="Li">$arr[time]</span> instead of
      <span class="Li">$arr[$time]</span>.</dd>
  <dt>Out of memory for yacc stack</dt>
  <dd>(F) The yacc parser wanted to grow its stack so it could continue parsing,
      but <b>realloc()</b> wouldn't give it more memory, virtual or
    otherwise.</dd>
  <dt>'.' outside of string in pack</dt>
  <dd>(F) The argument to a '.' in your template tried to move the working
      position to before the start of the packed string being built.</dd>
  <dt>'@' outside of string in unpack</dt>
  <dd>(F) You had a template that specified an absolute position outside the
      string being unpacked. See &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt>'@' outside of string with malformed UTF-8 in unpack</dt>
  <dd>(F) You had a template that specified an absolute position outside the
      string being unpacked. The string being unpacked was also invalid UTF-8.
      See &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt>overload arg '%s' is invalid</dt>
  <dd>(W overload) The overload pragma was passed an argument it did not
      recognize. Did you mistype an operator?</dd>
  <dt>Overloaded dereference did not return a reference</dt>
  <dd>(F) An object with an overloaded dereference operator was dereferenced,
      but the overloaded operation did not return a reference. See
    overload.</dd>
  <dt>Overloaded qr did not return a REGEXP</dt>
  <dd>(F) An object with a <span class="Li">&quot;qr&quot;</span> overload was
      used as part of a match, but the overloaded operation didn't return a
      compiled regexp. See overload.</dd>
  <dt>%s package attribute may clash with future reserved word: %s</dt>
  <dd>(W reserved) A lowercase attribute name was used that had a
      package-specific handler. That name might have a meaning to Perl itself
      some day, even though it doesn't yet. Perhaps you should use a mixed-case
      attribute name, instead. See attributes.</dd>
  <dt>pack/unpack repeat count overflow</dt>
  <dd>(F) You can't specify a repeat count so large that it overflows your
      signed integers. See &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt>page overflow</dt>
  <dd>(W io) A single call to <b>write()</b> produced more lines than can fit on
      a page. See perlform.</dd>
  <dt>panic: %s</dt>
  <dd>(P) An internal error.</dd>
  <dt>panic: attempt to call %s in %s</dt>
  <dd>(P) One of the file test operators entered a code branch that calls an ACL
      related-function, but that function is not available on this platform.
      Earlier checks mean that it should not be possible to enter this branch on
      this platform.</dd>
  <dt>panic: child pseudo-process was never scheduled</dt>
  <dd>(P) A child pseudo-process in the ithreads implementation on Windows was
      not scheduled within the time period allowed and therefore was not able to
      initialize properly.</dd>
  <dt>panic: ck_grep, type=%u</dt>

  <dt>POSIX syntax [%c %c] belongs inside character classes%s in regex; marked

  <dd>(W regexp) Perl thinks that you intended to write a POSIX character class,
      but didn't use enough brackets. These POSIX class constructs [: :], [= =],
      and [. .] go <i>inside</i> character classes, the [] are part of the
      construct, for example:
      <span class="Li">&quot;qr/[012[:alpha:]345]/&quot;</span>. What the
      regular expression pattern compiled to is probably not what you were
      intending. For example, <span class="Li">&quot;qr/[:alpha:]/&quot;</span>
      compiles to a regular bracketed character class consisting of the four
      characters <span class="Li">&quot;:&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;a&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;l&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;h&quot;</span>, and
      <span class="Li">&quot;p&quot;</span>. To specify the POSIX class, it
      should have been written
      <span class="Li">&quot;qr/[[:alpha:]]/&quot;</span>.
    <p class="Pp">Note that [= =] and [. .] are not currently implemented; they
        are simply placeholders for future extensions and will cause fatal

  <dt>Possible attempt to put comments in <b>qw()</b> list</dt>
  <dd>(W qw) <b>qw()</b> lists contain items separated by whitespace; as with

      treated as literal data. (You may have used different delimiters than the

    <p class="Pp">You probably wrote something like this:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    qw! a, b, c !;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">which puts literal commas into some of the list items. Write

  </dd>
  <dt>Possible memory corruption: %s overflowed 3rd argument</dt>
  <dd>(F) An <b>ioctl()</b> or <b>fcntl()</b> returned more than Perl was
      bargaining for. Perl guesses a reasonable buffer size, but puts a sentinel
      byte at the end of the buffer just in case. This sentinel byte got
      clobbered, and Perl assumes that memory is now corrupted. See
      &quot;ioctl&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt>Possible precedence issue with control flow operator</dt>
  <dd>(W syntax) There is a possible problem with the mixing of a control flow
      operator (e.g. <span class="Li">&quot;return&quot;</span>) and a
      low-precedence operator like <span class="Li">&quot;or&quot;</span>.
      Consider:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    sub { return $a or $b; }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This is parsed as:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    sub { (return $a) or $b; }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Which is effectively just:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    sub { return $a; }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Either use parentheses or the high-precedence variant of the
        operator.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note this may be also triggered for constructs like:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    sub { 1 if die; }
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>Possible precedence problem on bitwise %s operator</dt>
  <dd>(W precedence) Your program uses a bitwise logical operator in conjunction
      with a numeric comparison operator, like this :
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    if ($x &amp; $y == 0) { ... }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This expression is actually equivalent to
        <span class="Li">&quot;$x &amp; ($y == 0)&quot;</span>, due to the
        higher precedence of <span class="Li">&quot;==&quot;</span>. This is
        probably not what you want. (If you really meant to write this, disable
        the warning, or, better, put the parentheses explicitly and write
        <span class="Li">&quot;$x &amp; ($y == 0)&quot;</span>).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Possible unintended interpolation of $\ in regex</dt>
  <dd>(W ambiguous) You said something like
      <span class="Li">&quot;m/$\/&quot;</span> in a regex. The regex
      <span class="Li">&quot;m/foo$\s+bar/m&quot;</span> translates to: match
      the word 'foo', the output record separator (see &quot;$\&quot; in
      perlvar) and the letter 's' (one time or more) followed by the word 'bar'.
    <p class="Pp">If this is what you intended then you can silence the warning
        by using <span class="Li">&quot;m/${\}/&quot;</span> (for example:
        <span class="Li">&quot;m/foo${\}s+bar/&quot;</span>).</p>
    <p class="Pp">If instead you intended to match the word 'foo' at the end of
        the line followed by whitespace and the word 'bar' on the next line then
        you can use <span class="Li">&quot;m/$(?)\/&quot;</span> (for example:
        <span class="Li">&quot;m/foo$(?)\s+bar/&quot;</span>).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Possible unintended interpolation of %s in string</dt>
  <dd>(W ambiguous) You said something like '@foo' in a double-quoted string but
      there was no array <span class="Li">@foo</span> in scope at the time. If
      you wanted a literal <span class="Li">@foo</span>, then write it as \@foo;
      otherwise find out what happened to the array you apparently lost track

  <dd>(W regexp) You applied a regular expression quantifier in a place where it

      quantifier inside the assertion instead. For example, the way to match
      &quot;abc&quot; provided that it is followed by three repetitions of

  <dd>(F) One (or both) of the numeric arguments to the range operator

      <span class="Li">&quot;\179&quot;</span> in a double-quotish string. All
      but the last digit is treated as a single character, specified in octal.
      The last digit is the next character in the string. To tell Perl that this

  <dt>Scalar value @%s[%s] better written as $%s[%s]</dt>
  <dd>(W syntax) You've used an array slice (indicated by @) to select a single
      element of an array. Generally it's better to ask for a scalar value
      (indicated by $). The difference is that
      <span class="Li">$foo[&amp;bar]</span> always behaves like a scalar, both
      when assigning to it and when evaluating its argument, while
      <span class="Li">@foo[&amp;bar]</span> behaves like a list when you assign
      to it, and provides a list context to its subscript, which can do weird
      things if you're expecting only one subscript.
    <p class="Pp">On the other hand, if you were actually hoping to treat the
        array element as a list, you need to look into how references work,

  <dt>500 Server error</dt>
  <dd>(A) This is the error message generally seen in a browser window when
      trying to run a CGI program (including SSI) over the web. The actual error
      text varies widely from server to server. The most frequently-seen
      variants are &quot;500 Server error&quot;, &quot;Method (something) not
      permitted&quot;, &quot;Document contains no data&quot;, &quot;Premature
      end of script headers&quot;, and &quot;Did not produce a valid
      header&quot;.

  <dt><b>setsockopt()</b> on closed socket %s</dt>
  <dd>(W closed) You tried to set a socket option on a closed socket. Did you
      forget to check the return value of your <b>socket()</b> call? See
      &quot;setsockopt&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt>Setting $/ to a reference to %s is forbidden</dt>
  <dd>(F) You assigned a reference to a scalar to <span class="Li">$/</span>
      where the referenced item is not a positive integer. In older perls this
      <b>appeared</b> to work the same as setting it to
      <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> but was in fact internally
      different, less efficient and with very bad luck could have resulted in
      your file being split by a stringified form of the reference.
    <p class="Pp">In Perl 5.20.0 this was changed so that it would be
        <b>exactly</b> the same as setting <span class="Li">$/</span> to undef,
        with the exception that this warning would be thrown.</p>
    <p class="Pp">You are recommended to change your code to set
        <span class="Li">$/</span> to <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span>
        explicitly if you wish to slurp the file. As of Perl 5.28 assigning
        <span class="Li">$/</span> to a reference to an integer which isn't
        positive is a fatal error.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Setting $/ to %s reference is forbidden</dt>
  <dd>(F) You tried to assign a reference to a non integer to
      <span class="Li">$/</span>. In older Perls this would have behaved
      similarly to setting it to a reference to a positive integer, where the
      integer was the address of the reference. As of Perl 5.20.0 this is a
      fatal error, to allow future versions of Perl to use non-integer refs for
      more interesting purposes.</dd>
  <dt>shm%s not implemented</dt>
  <dd>(F) You don't have System V shared memory IPC on your system.</dd>
  <dt>!=~ should be !~</dt>
  <dd>(W syntax) The non-matching operator is !~, not !=~. !=~ will be
      interpreted as the != (numeric not equal) and ~ (1's complement)
      operators: probably not what you intended.</dd>
  <dt>/%s/ should probably be written as &quot;%s&quot;</dt>
  <dd>(W syntax) You have used a pattern where Perl expected to find a string,
      as in the first argument to <span class="Li">&quot;join&quot;</span>. Perl
      will treat the true or false result of matching the pattern against
      <span class="Li">$_</span> as the string, which is probably not what you
      had in mind.</dd>
  <dt><b>shutdown()</b> on closed socket %s</dt>
  <dd>(W closed) You tried to do a shutdown on a closed socket. Seems a bit
      superfluous.</dd>
  <dt>SIG%s handler &quot;%s&quot; not defined</dt>
  <dd>(W signal) The signal handler named in <span class="Li">%SIG</span>
      doesn't, in fact, exist. Perhaps you put it into the wrong package?</dd>
  <dt>Slab leaked from cv %p</dt>
  <dd>(S) If you see this message, then something is seriously wrong with the
      internal bookkeeping of op trees. An op tree needed to be freed after a
      compilation error, but could not be found, so it was leaked instead.</dd>
  <dt>sleep(%u) too large</dt>
  <dd>(W overflow) You called <span class="Li">&quot;sleep&quot;</span> with a
      number that was larger than it can reliably handle and
      <span class="Li">&quot;sleep&quot;</span> probably slept for less time
      than requested.</dd>
  <dt>Slurpy parameter not last</dt>
  <dd>(F) In a subroutine signature, you put something after a slurpy (array or
      hash) parameter. The slurpy parameter takes all the available arguments,
      so there can't be any left to fill later parameters.</dd>
  <dt>Smart matching a non-overloaded object breaks encapsulation</dt>
  <dd>(F) You should not use the <span class="Li">&quot;~~&quot;</span> operator
      on an object that does not overload it: Perl refuses to use the object's
      underlying structure for the smart match.</dd>
  <dt>Smartmatch is experimental</dt>
  <dd>(S experimental::smartmatch) This warning is emitted if you use the
      smartmatch (<span class="Li">&quot;~~&quot;</span>) operator. This is
      currently an experimental feature, and its details are subject to change
      in future releases of Perl. Particularly, its current behavior is noticed
      for being unnecessarily complex and unintuitive, and is very likely to be
      overhauled.</dd>
  <dt>Sorry, hash keys must be smaller than 2**31 bytes</dt>
  <dd>(F) You tried to create a hash containing a very large key, where
      &quot;very large&quot; means that it needs at least 2 gigabytes to store.
      Unfortunately, Perl doesn't yet handle such large hash keys. You should
      reconsider your design to avoid hashing such a long string directly.</dd>
  <dt>sort is now a reserved word</dt>
  <dd>(F) An ancient error message that almost nobody ever runs into anymore.
      But before sort was a keyword, people sometimes used it as a
    filehandle.</dd>
  <dt>Source filters apply only to byte streams</dt>
  <dd>(F) You tried to activate a source filter (usually by loading a source
      filter module) within a string passed to
      <span class="Li">&quot;eval&quot;</span>. This is not permitted under the
      <span class="Li">&quot;unicode_eval&quot;</span> feature. Consider using
      <span class="Li">&quot;evalbytes&quot;</span> instead. See feature.</dd>
  <dt><b>splice()</b> offset past end of array</dt>
  <dd>(W misc) You attempted to specify an offset that was past the end of the
      array passed to <b>splice()</b>. Splicing will instead commence at the end
      of the array, rather than past it. If this isn't what you want, try
      explicitly pre-extending the array by assigning $#array =
      <span class="Li">$offset</span>. See &quot;splice&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt>Split loop</dt>
  <dd>(P) The split was looping infinitely. (Obviously, a split shouldn't
      iterate more times than there are characters of input, which is what
      happened.) See &quot;split&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt>Statement unlikely to be reached</dt>
  <dd>(W exec) You did an <b>exec()</b> with some statement after it other than
      a <b>die()</b>. This is almost always an error, because <b>exec()</b>
      never returns unless there was a failure. You probably wanted to use
      <b>system()</b> instead, which does return. To suppress this warning, put
      the <b>exec()</b> in a block by itself.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;state&quot; subroutine %s can't be in a package</dt>
  <dd>(F) Lexically scoped subroutines aren't in a package, so it doesn't make
      sense to try to declare one with a package qualifier on the front.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;state %s&quot; used in sort comparison</dt>
  <dd>(W syntax) The package variables <span class="Li">$a</span> and
      <span class="Li">$b</span> are used for sort comparisons. You used
      <span class="Li">$a</span> or <span class="Li">$b</span> in as an operand
      to the <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;=&gt;&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;cmp&quot;</span> operator inside a sort comparison
      block, and the variable had earlier been declared as a lexical variable.
      Either qualify the sort variable with the package name, or rename the
      lexical variable.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;state&quot; variable %s can't be in a package</dt>
  <dd>(F) Lexically scoped variables aren't in a package, so it doesn't make
      sense to try to declare one with a package qualifier on the front. Use
      <b>local()</b> if you want to localize a package variable.</dd>
  <dt><b>stat()</b> on unopened filehandle %s</dt>
  <dd>(W unopened) You tried to use the <b>stat()</b> function on a filehandle
      that was either never opened or has since been closed.</dd>
  <dt>Strings with code points over 0xFF may not be mapped into in-memory file
    handles</dt>
  <dd>(W utf8) You tried to open a reference to a scalar for read or append
      where the scalar contained code points over 0xFF. In-memory files model
      on-disk files and can only contain bytes.</dd>
  <dt>Stub found while resolving method &quot;%s&quot; overloading
    &quot;%s&quot; in package &quot;%s&quot;</dt>
  <dd>(P) Overloading resolution over <span class="Li">@ISA</span> tree may be
      broken by importation stubs. Stubs should never be implicitly created, but
      explicit calls to <span class="Li">&quot;can&quot;</span> may break
    this.</dd>
  <dt>Subroutine attributes must come before the signature</dt>
  <dd>(F) When subroutine signatures are enabled, any subroutine attributes must
      come before the signature. Note that this order was the opposite in
      versions 5.22..5.26. So:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    sub foo :lvalue ($a, $b) { ... }  # 5.20 and 5.28 +
    sub foo ($a, $b) :lvalue { ... }  # 5.22 .. 5.26
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>Subroutine &quot;&amp;%s&quot; is not available</dt>
  <dd>(W closure) During compilation, an inner named subroutine or eval is
      attempting to capture an outer lexical subroutine that is not currently
      available. This can happen for one of two reasons. First, the lexical
      subroutine may be declared in an outer anonymous subroutine that has not
      yet been created. (Remember that named subs are created at compile time,
      while anonymous subs are created at run-time.) For example,
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    sub { my sub a {...} sub f { \&amp;a } }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">At the time that f is created, it can't capture the current
        &quot;a&quot; sub, since the anonymous subroutine hasn't been created
        yet. Conversely, the following won't give a warning since the anonymous
        subroutine has by now been created and is live:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    sub { my sub a {...} eval 'sub f { \&amp;a }' }-&gt;();
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The second situation is caused by an eval accessing a lexical
        subroutine that has gone out of scope, for example,</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    sub f {
        my sub a {...}
        sub { eval '\&amp;a' }
    }
    f()-&gt;();
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Here, when the '\&amp;a' in the eval is being compiled, f() is
        not currently being executed, so its &amp;a is not available for
        capture.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>&quot;%s&quot; subroutine &amp;%s masks earlier declaration in same
    %s</dt>
  <dd>(W shadow) A &quot;my&quot; or &quot;state&quot; subroutine has been
      redeclared in the current scope or statement, effectively eliminating all
      access to the previous instance. This is almost always a typographical
      error. Note that the earlier subroutine will still exist until the end of
      the scope or until all closure references to it are destroyed.</dd>
  <dt>Subroutine %s redefined</dt>
  <dd>(W redefine) You redefined a subroutine. To suppress this warning, say
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    {
        no warnings 'redefine';
        eval &quot;sub name { ... }&quot;;
    }
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>Subroutine &quot;%s&quot; will not stay shared</dt>
  <dd>(W closure) An inner (nested) <i>named</i> subroutine is referencing a
      &quot;my&quot; subroutine defined in an outer named subroutine.
    <p class="Pp">When the inner subroutine is called, it will see the value of
        the outer subroutine's lexical subroutine as it was before and during
        the *first* call to the outer subroutine; in this case, after the first
        call to the outer subroutine is complete, the inner and outer
        subroutines will no longer share a common value for the lexical
        subroutine. In other words, it will no longer be shared. This will
        especially make a difference if the lexical subroutines accesses lexical
        variables declared in its surrounding scope.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This problem can usually be solved by making the inner
        subroutine anonymous, using the <span class="Li">&quot;sub
        {}&quot;</span> syntax. When inner anonymous subs that reference lexical
        subroutines in outer subroutines are created, they are automatically
        rebound to the current values of such lexical subs.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Substitution loop</dt>
  <dd>(P) The substitution was looping infinitely. (Obviously, a substitution
      shouldn't iterate more times than there are characters of input, which is
      what happened.) See the discussion of substitution in &quot;Regexp
      Quote-Like Operators&quot; in perlop.</dd>
  <dt>Substitution pattern not terminated</dt>
  <dd>(F) The lexer couldn't find the interior delimiter of an s/// or s{}{}
      construct. Remember that bracketing delimiters count nesting level.
      Missing the leading <span class="Li">&quot;$&quot;</span> from variable
      <span class="Li">$s</span> may cause this error.</dd>
  <dt>Substitution replacement not terminated</dt>
  <dd>(F) The lexer couldn't find the final delimiter of an s/// or s{}{}
      construct. Remember that bracketing delimiters count nesting level.
      Missing the leading <span class="Li">&quot;$&quot;</span> from variable
      <span class="Li">$s</span> may cause this error.</dd>
  <dt>substr outside of string</dt>
  <dd>(W substr)(F) You tried to reference a <b>substr()</b> that pointed
      outside of a string. That is, the absolute value of the offset was larger
      than the length of the string. See &quot;substr&quot; in perlfunc. This
      warning is fatal if substr is used in an lvalue context (as the left hand
      side of an assignment or as a subroutine argument for example).</dd>
  <dt>sv_upgrade from type %d down to type %d</dt>
  <dd>(P) Perl tried to force the upgrade of an SV to a type which was actually
      inferior to its current type.</dd>
  <dt>SWASHNEW didn't return an HV ref</dt>
  <dd>(P) Something went wrong internally when Perl was trying to look up
      Unicode characters.</dd>
  <dt>Switch (?(condition)... contains too many branches in regex; marked by
    &lt;--&#x00A0;HERE in m/%s/</dt>
  <dd>(F) A (?(condition)if-clause|else-clause) construct can have at most two
      branches (the if-clause and the else-clause). If you want one or both to
      contain alternation, such as using
      <span class="Li">&quot;this|that|other&quot;</span>, enclose it in
      clustering parentheses:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>

  <dd>(F) The condition part of a (?(condition)if-clause|else-clause) construct

  <dt>Switch (?(condition)... not terminated in regex; marked by
    &lt;--&#x00A0;HERE in m/%s/</dt>
  <dd>(F) You omitted to close a (?(condition)...) block somewhere in the

  <dt>switching effective %s is not implemented</dt>
  <dd>(F) While under the <span class="Li">&quot;use filetest&quot;</span>
      pragma, we cannot switch the real and effective uids or gids.</dd>
  <dt>syntax error</dt>
  <dd>(F) Probably means you had a syntax error. Common reasons include:

    <pre>
    A keyword is misspelled.
    A semicolon is missing.
    A comma is missing.
    An opening or closing parenthesis is missing.
    An opening or closing brace is missing.
    A closing quote is missing.
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Often there will be another error message associated with the
        syntax error giving more information. (Sometimes it helps to turn on
        <b>-w</b>.) The error message itself often tells you where it was in the
        line when it decided to give up. Sometimes the actual error is several
        tokens before this, because Perl is good at understanding random input.
        Occasionally the line number may be misleading, and once in a blue moon
        the only way to figure out what's triggering the error is to call
        <span class="Li">&quot;perl -c&quot;</span> repeatedly, chopping away
        half the program each time to see if the error went away. Sort of the

      continue to pretend that it is. And if you quote me on that, I will deny
      it.</dd>
  <dt>The experimental declared_refs feature is not enabled</dt>
  <dd>(F) To declare references to variables, as in <span class="Li">&quot;my
      \%x&quot;</span>, you must first enable the feature:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    no warnings &quot;experimental::declared_refs&quot;;
    use feature &quot;declared_refs&quot;;
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>The %s function is unimplemented</dt>
  <dd>(F) The function indicated isn't implemented on this architecture,
      according to the probings of Configure.</dd>
  <dt>The regex_sets feature is experimental</dt>
  <dd>(S experimental::regex_sets) This warning is emitted if you use the syntax
      <span class="Li">&quot;(?[&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;])&quot;</span> in a
      regular expression. The details of this feature are subject to change. If
      you want to use it, but know that in doing so you are taking the risk of
      using an experimental feature which may change in a future Perl version,
      you can do this to silence the warning:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    no warnings &quot;experimental::regex_sets&quot;;
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>The script_run feature is experimental</dt>
  <dd>(S experimental::script_run) This feature is experimental and its behavior
      may in any future release of perl. See &quot;Script Runs&quot; in
    perlre.</dd>
  <dt>The signatures feature is experimental</dt>
  <dd>(S experimental::signatures) This warning is emitted if you unwrap a
      subroutine's arguments using a signature. Simply suppress the warning if
      you want to use the feature, but know that in doing so you are taking the
      risk of using an experimental feature which may change or be removed in a
      future Perl version:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    no warnings &quot;experimental::signatures&quot;;
    use feature &quot;signatures&quot;;
    sub foo ($left, $right) { ... }
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>The stat preceding %s wasn't an lstat</dt>
  <dd>(F) It makes no sense to test the current stat buffer for symbolic
      linkhood if the last stat that wrote to the stat buffer already went past
      the symlink to get to the real file. Use an actual filename instead.</dd>
  <dt>The 'unique' attribute may only be applied to 'our' variables</dt>
  <dd>(F) This attribute was never supported on

  <dt>This Perl can't reset CRTL environ elements (%s)</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>This Perl can't set CRTL environ elements (%s=%s)</dt>
  <dd>(W internal) Warnings peculiar to VMS. You tried to change or delete an
      element of the CRTL's internal environ array, but your copy of Perl wasn't
      built with a CRTL that contained the <b>setenv()</b> function. You'll need
      to rebuild Perl with a CRTL that does, or redefine <i>PERL_ENV_TABLES</i>
      (see perlvms) so that the environ array isn't the target of the change to
      <span class="Li">%ENV</span> which produced the warning.</dd>
  <dt>This Perl has not been built with support for randomized hash key
    traversal but something called <b>Perl_hv_rand_set()</b>.</dt>
  <dd>(F) Something has attempted to use an internal API call which depends on
      Perl being compiled with the default support for randomized hash key
      traversal, but this Perl has been compiled without it. You should report
      this warning to the relevant upstream party, or recompile perl with
      default options.</dd>
  <dt>times not implemented</dt>
  <dd>(F) Your version of the C library apparently doesn't do <b>times()</b>. I
      suspect you're not running on Unix.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;-T&quot; is on the #! line, it must also be used on the command
    line</dt>
  <dd>(X) The #! line (or local equivalent) in a Perl script contains the
      <b>-T</b> option (or the <b>-t</b> option), but Perl was not invoked with
      <b>-T</b> in its command line. This is an error because, by the time Perl
      discovers a <b>-T</b> in a script, it's too late to properly taint
      everything from the environment. So Perl gives up.
    <p class="Pp">If the Perl script is being executed as a command using the #!
        mechanism (or its local equivalent), this error can usually be fixed by
        editing the #! line so that the <b>-%c</b> option is a part of Perl's
        first argument: e.g. change <span class="Li">&quot;perl -n
        -%c&quot;</span> to <span class="Li">&quot;perl -%c -n&quot;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If the Perl script is being executed as
        <span class="Li">&quot;perl scriptname&quot;</span>, then the <b>-%c</b>
        option must appear on the command line: <span class="Li">&quot;perl -%c
        scriptname&quot;</span>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>To%s: illegal mapping '%s'</dt>
  <dd>(F) You tried to define a customized To-mapping for <b>lc()</b>, lcfirst,
      <b>uc()</b>, or <b>ucfirst()</b> (or their string-inlined versions), but
      you specified an illegal mapping. See &quot;User-Defined Character
      Properties&quot; in perlunicode.</dd>
  <dt>Too deeply nested ()-groups</dt>
  <dd>(F) Your template contains ()-groups with a ridiculously deep nesting
      level.</dd>
  <dt>Too few args to syscall</dt>
  <dd>(F) There has to be at least one argument to <b>syscall()</b> to specify
      the system call to call, silly dilly.</dd>
  <dt>Too few arguments for subroutine '%s'</dt>
  <dd>(F) A subroutine using a signature fewer arguments than required by the
      signature. The caller of the subroutine is presumably at fault.
    <p class="Pp">The message attempts to include the name of the called
        subroutine. If the subroutine has been aliased, the subroutine's
        original name will be shown, regardless of what name the caller
      used.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Too late for &quot;-%s&quot; option</dt>
  <dd>(X) The #! line (or local equivalent) in a Perl script contains the
      <b>-M</b>, <b>-m</b> or <b>-C</b> option.
    <p class="Pp">In the case of <b>-M</b> and <b>-m</b>, this is an error
        because those options are not intended for use inside scripts. Use the
        <span class="Li">&quot;use&quot;</span> pragma instead.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The <b>-C</b> option only works if it is specified on the
        command line as well (with the same sequence of letters or numbers
        following). Either specify this option on the command line, or, if your
        system supports it, make your script executable and run it directly
        instead of passing it to perl.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Too late to run %s block</dt>
  <dd>(W void) A CHECK or INIT block is being defined during run time proper,
      when the opportunity to run them has already passed. Perhaps you are
      loading a file with <span class="Li">&quot;require&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;do&quot;</span> when you should be using
      <span class="Li">&quot;use&quot;</span> instead. Or perhaps you should put
      the <span class="Li">&quot;require&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;do&quot;</span> inside a BEGIN block.</dd>
  <dt>Too many args to syscall</dt>
  <dd>(F) Perl supports a maximum of only 14 args to <b>syscall()</b>.</dd>
  <dt>Too many arguments for %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) The function requires fewer arguments than you specified.</dd>
  <dt>Too many arguments for subroutine '%s'</dt>
  <dd>(F) A subroutine using a signature received more arguments than permitted
      by the signature. The caller of the subroutine is presumably at fault.
    <p class="Pp">The message attempts to include the name of the called
        subroutine. If the subroutine has been aliased, the subroutine's
        original name will be shown, regardless of what name the caller

  <dd>(F) Your machine doesn't implement a file truncation mechanism that
      Configure knows about.</dd>
  <dt>Type of arg %d to &amp;CORE::%s must be %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) The subroutine in question in the CORE package requires its argument
      to be a hard reference to data of the specified type. Overloading is
      ignored, so a reference to an object that is not the specified type, but
      nonetheless has overloading to handle it, will still not be accepted.</dd>
  <dt>Type of arg %d to %s must be %s (not %s)</dt>
  <dd>(F) This function requires the argument in that position to be of a
      certain type. Arrays must be <span class="Li">@NAME</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;@{EXPR}&quot;</span>. Hashes must be
      <span class="Li">%NAME</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;%{EXPR}&quot;</span>. No implicit dereferencing is
      allowed--use the {EXPR} forms as an explicit dereference. See
    perlref.</dd>
  <dt>umask not implemented</dt>
  <dd>(F) Your machine doesn't implement the umask function and you tried to use
      it to restrict permissions for yourself (EXPR &amp; 0700).</dd>

    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">There should be an operator before the

  <dt>Unicode non-character U+%X is not recommended for open interchange</dt>
  <dd>(S nonchar) Certain codepoints, such as U+FFFE and U+FFFF, are defined by
      the Unicode standard to be non-characters. Those are legal codepoints, but
      are reserved for internal use; so, applications shouldn't attempt to
      exchange them. An application may not be expecting any of these characters
      at all, and receiving them may lead to bugs. If you know what you are
      doing you can turn off this warning by <span class="Li">&quot;no warnings
      'nonchar';&quot;</span>.
    <p class="Pp">This is not really a &quot;severe&quot; error, but it is
        supposed to be raised by default even if warnings are not enabled, and
        currently the only way to do that in Perl is to mark it as serious.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Unicode surrogate U+%X is illegal in UTF-8</dt>
  <dd>(S surrogate) You had a UTF-16 surrogate in a context where they are not
      considered acceptable. These code points, between U+D800 and U+DFFF
      (inclusive), are used by Unicode only for UTF-16. However, Perl internally
      allows all unsigned integer code points (up to the size limit available on
      your platform), including surrogates. But these can cause problems when
      being input or output, which is likely where this message came from. If
      you really really know what you are doing you can turn off this warning by
      <span class="Li">&quot;no warnings 'surrogate';&quot;</span>.</dd>
  <dt>Unknown charname '%s'</dt>
  <dd>(F) The name you used inside <span class="Li">&quot;\N{}&quot;</span> is
      unknown to Perl. Check the spelling. You can say
      <span class="Li">&quot;use charnames &quot;:loose&quot;&quot;</span> to
      not have to be so precise about spaces, hyphens, and capitalization on
      standard Unicode names. (Any custom aliases that have been created must be
      specified exactly, regardless of whether
      <span class="Li">&quot;:loose&quot;</span> is used or not.) This error may
      also happen if the <span class="Li">&quot;\N{}&quot;</span> is not in the
      scope of the corresponding
      <span class="Li">&quot;use&#x00A0;charnames&quot;</span>.</dd>
  <dt>Unknown '(*...)' construct '%s' in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in
    m/%s/</dt>
  <dd>(F) The <span class="Li">&quot;(*&quot;</span> was followed by something
      that the regular expression compiler does not recognize. Check your
      spelling.</dd>
  <dt>Unknown error</dt>
  <dd>(P) Perl was about to print an error message in
      <span class="Li">$@</span>, but the <span class="Li">$@</span> variable
      did not exist, even after an attempt to create it.</dd>
  <dt>Unknown locale category %d; can't set it to %s</dt>
  <dd>(W locale) You used a locale category that perl doesn't recognize, so it
      cannot carry out your request. Check that you are using a valid category.
      If so, see &quot;Multi-threaded&quot; in perllocale for advice on
      reporting this as a bug, and for modifying perl locally to accommodate
      your needs.</dd>
  <dt>Unknown <b>open()</b> mode '%s'</dt>
  <dd>(F) The second argument of 3-argument <b>open()</b> is not among the list
      of valid modes: <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;&gt;&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;</span>,

      <span class="Li">&quot;&gt;&amp;&quot;</span>.</dd>
  <dt>Unknown PerlIO layer &quot;%s&quot;</dt>
  <dd>(W layer) An attempt was made to push an unknown layer onto the Perl I/O
      system. (Layers take care of transforming data between external and
      internal representations.) Note that some layers, such as
      <span class="Li">&quot;mmap&quot;</span>, are not supported in all
      environments. If your program didn't explicitly request the failing
      operation, it may be the result of the value of the environment variable
      PERLIO.</dd>
  <dt>Unknown process %x sent message to prime_env_iter: %s</dt>
  <dd>(P) An error peculiar to VMS. Perl was reading values for
      <span class="Li">%ENV</span> before iterating over it, and someone else
      stuck a message in the stream of data Perl expected. Someone's very
      confused, or perhaps trying to subvert Perl's population of
      <span class="Li">%ENV</span> for nefarious purposes.</dd>
  <dt>Unknown regexp modifier &quot;/%s&quot;</dt>
  <dd>(F) Alphanumerics immediately following the closing delimiter of a regular
      expression pattern are interpreted by Perl as modifier flags for the
      regex. One of the ones you specified is invalid. One way this can happen
      is if you didn't put in white space between the end of the regex and a
      following alphanumeric operator:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
 if ($a =~ /foo/and $bar == 3) { ... }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;a&quot;</span> is a valid modifier
        flag, but the <span class="Li">&quot;n&quot;</span> is not, and raises
        this error. Likely what was meant instead was:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
 if ($a =~ /foo/ and $bar == 3) { ... }
    </pre>

  <dd>(F) The condition part of a (?(condition)if-clause|else-clause) construct
      is not known. The condition must be one of the following:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>

  <dd>(F) You either made a typo or have incorrectly put a

      your pattern. Check the pattern and review perlre for details on legal
      verb patterns.</dd>
  <dt>Unknown warnings category '%s'</dt>
  <dd>(F) An error issued by the <span class="Li">&quot;warnings&quot;</span>
      pragma. You specified a warnings category that is unknown to perl at this
      point.
    <p class="Pp">Note that if you want to enable a warnings category registered
        by a module (e.g. <span class="Li">&quot;use warnings
        'File::Find'&quot;</span>), you must have loaded this module first.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Unmatched [ in regex; marked by &lt;--&#x00A0;HERE in m/%s/</dt>
  <dd>(F) The brackets around a character class must match. If you wish to
      include a closing bracket in a character class, backslash it or put it
      first. The &lt;--&#x00A0;HERE shows whereabouts in the regular expression
      the problem was discovered. See perlre.</dd>
  <dt>Unmatched ( in regex; marked by &lt;--&#x00A0;HERE in m/%s/</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>Unmatched ) in regex; marked by &lt;--&#x00A0;HERE in m/%s/</dt>
  <dd>(F) Unbackslashed parentheses must always be balanced in regular
      expressions. If you're a vi user, the % key is valuable for finding the
      matching parenthesis. The &lt;--&#x00A0;HERE shows whereabouts in the
      regular expression the problem was discovered. See perlre.</dd>
  <dt>Unmatched right %s bracket</dt>
  <dd>(F) The lexer counted more closing curly or square brackets than opening
      ones, so you're probably missing a matching opening bracket. As a general
      rule, you'll find the missing one (so to speak) near the place you were
      last editing.</dd>
  <dt>Unquoted string &quot;%s&quot; may clash with future reserved word</dt>
  <dd>(W reserved) You used a bareword that might someday be claimed as a
      reserved word. It's best to put such a word in quotes, or capitalize it
      somehow, or insert an underbar into it. You might also declare it as a
      subroutine.</dd>
  <dt>Unrecognized character %s; marked by &lt;--&#x00A0;HERE after %s near
    column %d</dt>
  <dd>(F) The Perl parser has no idea what to do with the specified character in
      your Perl script (or eval) near the specified column. Perhaps you tried to
      run a compressed script, a binary program, or a directory as a Perl
      program.</dd>
  <dt>Unrecognized escape \%c in character class in regex; marked by
    &lt;--&#x00A0;HERE in m/%s/</dt>
  <dd>(F) You used a backslash-character combination which is not recognized by

      class is used within <span class="Li">&quot;(?[ ])&quot;</span>.</dd>
  <dt>Unrecognized escape \%c in character class passed through in regex; marked

      was discovered.</dd>
  <dt>Unrecognized escape \%c passed through</dt>
  <dd>(W misc) You used a backslash-character combination which is not

      may change in a future version of Perl. The &lt;--&#x00A0;HERE shows
      whereabouts in the regular expression the escape was discovered.</dd>
  <dt>Unrecognized signal name &quot;%s&quot;</dt>
  <dd>(F) You specified a signal name to the <b>kill()</b> function that was not
      recognized. Say <span class="Li">&quot;kill -l&quot;</span> in your shell
      to see the valid signal names on your system.</dd>
  <dt>Unrecognized switch: -%s (-h will show valid options)</dt>
  <dd>(F) You specified an illegal option to Perl. Don't do that. (If you think
      you didn't do that, check the #! line to see if it's supplying the bad
      switch on your behalf.)</dd>
  <dt>Unsuccessful %s on filename containing newline</dt>
  <dd>(W newline) A file operation was attempted on a filename, and that
      operation failed, PROBABLY because the filename contained a newline,
      PROBABLY because you forgot to <b>chomp()</b> it off. See
      &quot;chomp&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt>Unsupported directory function &quot;%s&quot; called</dt>
  <dd>(F) Your machine doesn't support <b>opendir()</b> and
    <b>readdir()</b>.</dd>
  <dt>Unsupported function %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) This machine doesn't implement the indicated function, apparently. At
      least, Configure doesn't think so.</dd>
  <dt>Unsupported function fork</dt>
  <dd>(F) Your version of executable does not support forking.
    <p class="Pp">Note that under some systems, like OS/2, there may be
        different flavors of Perl executables, some of which may support fork,
        some not. Try changing the name you call Perl by to

        <span class="Li">&quot;perl__&quot;</span>, and so on.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Unsupported script encoding %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) Your program file begins with a Unicode Byte Order Mark (BOM) which
      declares it to be in a Unicode encoding that Perl cannot read.</dd>
  <dt>Unsupported socket function &quot;%s&quot; called</dt>
  <dd>(F) Your machine doesn't support the Berkeley socket mechanism, or at
      least that's what Configure thought.</dd>
  <dt>Unterminated '(*...' argument in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in

      pattern with a <span class="Li">&quot;)&quot;</span>. Fix the pattern and
      retry.</dd>
  <dt>Unterminated attribute list</dt>
  <dd>(F) The lexer found something other than a simple identifier at the start
      of an attribute, and it wasn't a semicolon or the start of a block.
      Perhaps you terminated the parameter list of the previous attribute too
      soon. See attributes.</dd>
  <dt>Unterminated attribute parameter in attribute list</dt>
  <dd>(F) The lexer saw an opening (left) parenthesis character while parsing an
      attribute list, but the matching closing (right) parenthesis character was
      not found. You may need to add (or remove) a backslash character to get
      your parentheses to balance. See attributes.</dd>
  <dt>Unterminated compressed integer</dt>
  <dd>(F) An argument to unpack(&quot;w&quot;,...) was incompatible with the BER
      compressed integer format and could not be converted to an integer. See

  <dt>Unterminated delimiter for here document</dt>
  <dd>(F) This message occurs when a here document label has an initial

  <dd>(F) In a regular expression, you had a

      group reference. In the case of <span class="Li">&quot;\g{&quot;</span>,
      the closing brace is missing; otherwise the

      the pattern and retry.</dd>
  <dt>Unterminated &lt;&gt; operator</dt>
  <dd>(F) The lexer saw a left angle bracket in a place where it was expecting a
      term, so it's looking for the corresponding right angle bracket, and not
      finding it. Chances are you left some needed parentheses out earlier in

  <dt>Useless (?%s) - use /%s modifier in regex; marked by &lt;--&#x00A0;HERE in
    m/%s/</dt>
  <dd>(W regexp) You have used an internal modifier such as (?o) that has no

  <dt>Useless use of attribute &quot;const&quot;</dt>
  <dd>(W misc) The <span class="Li">&quot;const&quot;</span> attribute has no

      handler for an anonymous subroutine.</dd>
  <dt>Useless use of /d modifier in transliteration operator</dt>
  <dd>(W misc) You have used the /d modifier where the searchlist has the same
      length as the replacelist. See perlop for more information about the /d
      modifier.</dd>
  <dt>Useless use of \E</dt>
  <dd>(W misc) You have a \E in a double-quotish string without a

  <dt>Useless use of greediness modifier '%c' in regex; marked by

  <dd>(W regexp) You specified something like these:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
 qr/a{3}?/
 qr/b{1,1}+/
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;?&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;+&quot;</span> don't have any effect, as they
        modify whether to match more or fewer when there is a choice, and by
        specifying to match exactly a given numer, there is no room left for a
        choice.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Useless use of %s in void context</dt>
  <dd>(W void) You did something without a side effect in a context that does
      nothing with the return value, such as a statement that doesn't return a
      value from a block, or the left side of a scalar comma operator. Very
      often this points not to stupidity on your part, but a failure of Perl to
      parse your program the way you thought it would. For example, you'd get
      this if you mixed up your C precedence with Python precedence and said
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    $one, $two = 1, 2;

    $array = [1,2];
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The square brackets explicitly turn a list value into a scalar
        value, while parentheses do not. So when a parenthesized list is
        evaluated in a scalar context, the comma is treated like C's comma

  <dd>(F) You used a code point that is not allowed, because it is too large.
      Unicode only allows code points up to 0x10FFFF, but Perl allows much
      larger ones. Earlier versions of Perl allowed code points above IV_MAX
      (0x7FFFFFF on 32-bit platforms, 0x7FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF on 64-bit platforms),

      constructs, including causing it to hang in a few cases.
    <p class="Pp">If your code is to run on various platforms, keep in mind that

  <dt>Use of := for an empty attribute list is not allowed</dt>

      (applying an empty attribute list to <span class="Li">$x</span>). This
      construct was deprecated in 5.12.0, and has now been made a syntax error,

  <dt>Use of %s for non-UTF-8 locale is wrong. Assuming a UTF-8 locale</dt>
  <dd>(W locale) You are matching a regular expression using locale rules, and
      the specified construct was encountered. This construct is only valid for
      UTF-8 locales, which the current locale isn't. This doesn't make sense.
      Perl will continue, assuming a Unicode (UTF-8) locale, but the results are
      likely to be wrong.</dd>
  <dt>Use of freed value in iteration</dt>
  <dd>(F) Perhaps you modified the iterated array within the loop? This error is
      typically caused by code like the following:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    @a = (3,4);
    @a = () for (1,2,@a);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">You are not supposed to modify arrays while they are being
        iterated over. For speed and efficiency reasons, Perl internally does
        not do full reference-counting of iterated items, hence deleting such an
        item in the middle of an iteration causes Perl to see a freed value.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Use of /g modifier is meaningless in split</dt>
  <dd>(W regexp) You used the /g modifier on the pattern for a
      <span class="Li">&quot;split&quot;</span> operator. Since
      <span class="Li">&quot;split&quot;</span> always tries to match the
      pattern repeatedly, the <span class="Li">&quot;/g&quot;</span> has no

      autoloaded were called as plain functions (e.g.
      <span class="Li">&quot;Foo::bar()&quot;</span>), not as methods (e.g.

  </dd>
  <dt>Use of %s in printf format not supported</dt>
  <dd>(F) You attempted to use a feature of printf that is accessible from only
      C. This usually means there's a better way to do it in Perl.</dd>
  <dt>Use of -l on filehandle%s</dt>
  <dd>(W io) A filehandle represents an opened file, and when you opened the

  <dt>Use of reference &quot;%s&quot; as array index</dt>
  <dd>(W misc) You tried to use a reference as an array index; this probably
      isn't what you mean, because references in numerical context tend to be
      huge numbers, and so usually indicates programmer error.
    <p class="Pp">If you really do mean it, explicitly numify your reference,
        like so: <span class="Li">$array[0+$ref]</span>. This warning is not
        given for overloaded objects, however, because you can overload the

  <dt>Use of strings with code points over 0xFF as arguments to %s operator is

      over 0xFF. The string bitwise operators treat their operands as strings of

      perlsec.</dd>
  <dt>Use of unassigned code point or non-standalone grapheme for a delimiter
    will be a fatal error starting in Perl 5.30</dt>
  <dd>(D deprecated) A grapheme is what appears to a native-speaker of a
      language to be a character. In Unicode (and hence Perl) a grapheme may
      actually be several adjacent characters that together form a complete
      grapheme. For example, there can be a base character, like &quot;R&quot;
      and an accent, like a circumflex &quot;^&quot;, that appear when displayed
      to be a single character with the circumflex hovering over the
      &quot;R&quot;. Perl currently allows things like that circumflex to be
      delimiters of strings, patterns, <i>etc</i>. When displayed, the
      circumflex would look like it belongs to the character just to the left of
      it. In order to move the language to be able to accept graphemes as
      delimiters, we have to deprecate the use of delimiters which aren't
      graphemes by themselves. Also, a delimiter must already be assigned (or
      known to be never going to be assigned) to try to future-proof code, for
      otherwise code that works today would fail to compile if the currently
      unassigned delimiter ends up being something that isn't a stand-alone
      grapheme. Because Unicode is never going to assign non-character code
      points, nor code points that are above the legal Unicode maximum, those
      can be delimiters, and their use won't raise this warning.</dd>
  <dt>Use of uninitialized value%s</dt>
  <dd>(W uninitialized) An undefined value was used as if it were already
      defined. It was interpreted as a &quot;&quot; or a 0, but maybe it was a
      mistake. To suppress this warning assign a defined value to your
      variables.
    <p class="Pp">To help you figure out what was undefined, perl will try to
        tell you the name of the variable (if any) that was undefined. In some
        cases it cannot do this, so it also tells you what operation you used
        the undefined value in. Note, however, that perl optimizes your program
        and the operation displayed in the warning may not necessarily appear
        literally in your program. For example, <span class="Li">&quot;that
        $foo&quot;</span> is usually optimized into
        <span class="Li">&quot;&quot;that &quot; . $foo&quot;</span>, and the
        warning will refer to the <span class="Li">&quot;concatenation
        (.)&quot;</span> operator, even though there is no
        <span class="Li">&quot;.&quot;</span> in your program.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>&quot;use re 'strict'&quot; is experimental</dt>
  <dd>(S experimental::re_strict) The things that are different when a regular
      expression pattern is compiled under <span class="Li">'strict'</span> are
      subject to change in future Perl releases in incompatible ways. This means
      that a pattern that compiles today may not in a future Perl release. This
      warning is to alert you to that risk.</dd>
  <dt>Use \x{...} for more than two hex characters in regex; marked by

  <dd>(W regexp) Named Unicode character escapes
      <span class="Li">&quot;(\N{...})&quot;</span> may return a multi-character
      sequence. Even though a character class is supposed to match just one
      character of input, perl will match the whole thing correctly, except when
      the class is inverted (<span class="Li">&quot;[^...]&quot;</span>), or the
      escape is the beginning or final end point of a range. For these, what
      should happen isn't clear at all. In these circumstances, Perl discards
      all but the first character of the returned sequence, which is not likely
      what you want.</dd>
  <dt>Using /u for '%s' instead of /%s in regex; marked by &lt;--&#x00A0;HERE in
    m/%s/</dt>
  <dd>(W regexp) You used a Unicode boundary
      (<span class="Li">&quot;\b{...}&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;\B{...}&quot;</span>) in a portion of a regular
      expression where the character set modifiers
      <span class="Li">&quot;/a&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;/aa&quot;</span> are in effect. These two modifiers
      indicate an ASCII interpretation, and this doesn't make sense for a
      Unicode definition. The generated regular expression will compile so that
      the boundary uses all of Unicode. No other portion of the regular
      expression is affected.</dd>
  <dt>Using !~ with %s doesn't make sense</dt>
  <dd>(F) Using the <span class="Li">&quot;!~&quot;</span> operator with

      <span class="Li">&quot;tr///r&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;y///r&quot;</span> is currently reserved for future
      use, as the exact behavior has not been decided. (Simply returning the
      boolean opposite of the modified string is usually not particularly
      useful.)</dd>
  <dt>UTF-16 surrogate U+%X</dt>
  <dd>(S surrogate) You had a UTF-16 surrogate in a context where they are not
      considered acceptable. These code points, between U+D800 and U+DFFF
      (inclusive), are used by Unicode only for UTF-16. However, Perl internally
      allows all unsigned integer code points (up to the size limit available on
      your platform), including surrogates. But these can cause problems when
      being input or output, which is likely where this message came from. If
      you really really know what you are doing you can turn off this warning by
      <span class="Li">&quot;no warnings 'surrogate';&quot;</span>.</dd>
  <dt>Value of %s can be &quot;0&quot;; test with <b>defined()</b></dt>
  <dd>(W misc) In a conditional expression, you used &lt;HANDLE&gt;, &lt;*&gt;
      (glob), <span class="Li">&quot;each()&quot;</span>, or
      <span class="Li">&quot;readdir()&quot;</span> as a boolean value. Each of
      these constructs can return a value of &quot;0&quot;; that would make the
      conditional expression false, which is probably not what you intended.
      When using these constructs in conditional expressions, test their values
      with the <span class="Li">&quot;defined&quot;</span> operator.</dd>
  <dt>Value of CLI symbol &quot;%s&quot; too long</dt>
  <dd>(W misc) A warning peculiar to VMS. Perl tried to read the value of an
      <span class="Li">%ENV</span> element from a CLI symbol table, and found a
      resultant string longer than 1024 characters. The return value has been
      truncated to 1024 characters.</dd>
  <dt>Variable &quot;%s&quot; is not available</dt>
  <dd>(W closure) During compilation, an inner named subroutine or eval is
      attempting to capture an outer lexical that is not currently available.
      This can happen for one of two reasons. First, the outer lexical may be
      declared in an outer anonymous subroutine that has not yet been created.
      (Remember that named subs are created at compile time, while anonymous
      subs are created at run-time.) For example,
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    sub { my $a; sub f { $a } }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">At the time that f is created, it can't capture the current
        value of <span class="Li">$a</span>, since the anonymous subroutine
        hasn't been created yet. Conversely, the following won't give a warning
        since the anonymous subroutine has by now been created and is live:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    sub { my $a; eval 'sub f { $a }' }-&gt;();
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The second situation is caused by an eval accessing a variable
        that has gone out of scope, for example,</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    sub f {
        my $a;
        sub { eval '$a' }
    }
    f()-&gt;();
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Here, when the '$a' in the eval is being compiled, f() is not
        currently being executed, so its <span class="Li">$a</span> is not
        available for capture.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Variable &quot;%s&quot; is not imported%s</dt>
  <dd>(S misc) With &quot;use strict&quot; in effect, you referred to a global
      variable that you apparently thought was imported from another module,
      because something else of the same name (usually a subroutine) is exported
      by that module. It usually means you put the wrong funny character on the
      front of your variable.</dd>
  <dt>Variable length lookbehind not implemented in regex m/%s/</dt>
  <dd>(F) Lookbehind is allowed only for subexpressions whose length is fixed
      and known at compile time. For positive lookbehind, you can use the
      <span class="Li">&quot;\K&quot;</span> regex construct as a way to get the
      equivalent functionality. See (?&lt;=pattern) and \K in perlre.
    <p class="Pp">Starting in Perl 5.18, there are non-obvious Unicode rules
        under <span class="Li">&quot;/i&quot;</span> that can match variably,
        but which you might not think could. For example, the substring
        <span class="Li">&quot;ss&quot;</span> can match the single character
        LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S. Here's a complete list of the current ones
        affecting ASCII characters:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
   ASCII
  sequence      Matches single letter under /i
    FF          U+FB00 LATIN SMALL LIGATURE FF
    FFI         U+FB03 LATIN SMALL LIGATURE FFI
    FFL         U+FB04 LATIN SMALL LIGATURE FFL
    FI          U+FB01 LATIN SMALL LIGATURE FI
    FL          U+FB02 LATIN SMALL LIGATURE FL
    SS          U+00DF LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S
                U+1E9E LATIN CAPITAL LETTER SHARP S
    ST          U+FB06 LATIN SMALL LIGATURE ST
                U+FB05 LATIN SMALL LIGATURE LONG S T
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This list is subject to change, but is quite unlikely to. Each
        ASCII sequence can be any combination of upper- and lowercase.</p>
    <p class="Pp">You can avoid this by using a bracketed character class in the
        lookbehind assertion, like</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
 (?&lt;![sS]t)
 (?&lt;![fF]f[iI])
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This fools Perl into not matching the ligatures.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Another option for Perls starting with 5.16, if you only care
        about ASCII matches, is to add the
        <span class="Li">&quot;/aa&quot;</span> modifier to the regex. This will
        exclude all these non-obvious matches, thus getting rid of this message.
        You can also say</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>

  <dt>Variable &quot;%s&quot; will not stay shared</dt>
  <dd>(W closure) An inner (nested) <i>named</i> subroutine is referencing a
      lexical variable defined in an outer named subroutine.
    <p class="Pp">When the inner subroutine is called, it will see the value of
        the outer subroutine's variable as it was before and during the *first*
        call to the outer subroutine; in this case, after the first call to the
        outer subroutine is complete, the inner and outer subroutines will no
        longer share a common value for the variable. In other words, the
        variable will no longer be shared.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This problem can usually be solved by making the inner
        subroutine anonymous, using the <span class="Li">&quot;sub
        {}&quot;</span> syntax. When inner anonymous subs that reference
        variables in outer subroutines are created, they are automatically
        rebound to the current values of such variables.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>vector argument not supported with alpha versions</dt>
  <dd>(S printf) The <span class="Li">%vd</span> (s)printf format does not
      support version objects with alpha parts.</dd>
  <dt>Verb pattern '%s' has a mandatory argument in regex; marked by
    &lt;--&#x00A0;HERE in m/%s/</dt>
  <dd>(F) You used a verb pattern that requires an argument. Supply an argument

  <dt>Verb pattern '%s' may not have an argument in regex; marked by

  <dd>(F) You used a verb pattern that is not allowed an argument. Remove the
      argument or check that you are using the right verb.</dd>
  <dt>Version control conflict marker</dt>
  <dd>(F) The parser found a line starting with
      <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;</span>, or
      <span class="Li">&quot;=======&quot;</span>. These may be left by a
      version control system to mark conflicts after a failed merge
    operation.</dd>
  <dt>Version number must be a constant number</dt>
  <dd>(P) The attempt to translate a <span class="Li">&quot;use Module n.n
      LIST&quot;</span> statement into its equivalent
      <span class="Li">&quot;BEGIN&quot;</span> block found an internal
      inconsistency with the version number.</dd>
  <dt>Version string '%s' contains invalid data; ignoring: '%s'</dt>
  <dd>(W misc) The version string contains invalid characters at the end, which
      are being ignored.</dd>
  <dt>Warning: something's wrong</dt>
  <dd>(W) You passed <b>warn()</b> an empty string (the equivalent of
      <span class="Li">&quot;warn &quot;&quot;&quot;</span>) or you called it
      with no args and <span class="Li">$@</span> was empty.</dd>
  <dt>Warning: unable to close filehandle %s properly</dt>
  <dd>(S) The implicit <b>close()</b> done by an <b>open()</b> got an error
      indication on the <b>close()</b>. This usually indicates your file system
      ran out of disk space.</dd>
  <dt>Warning: unable to close filehandle properly: %s</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>Warning: unable to close filehandle %s properly: %s</dt>
  <dd>(S io) There were errors during the implicit <b>close()</b> done on a
      filehandle when its reference count reached zero while it was still open,
      e.g.:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    {
        open my $fh, '&gt;', $file  or die &quot;open: '$file': $!\n&quot;;
        print $fh $data or die &quot;print: $!&quot;;
    } # implicit close here
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Because various errors may only be detected by <b>close()</b>
        (e.g. buffering could allow the
        <span class="Li">&quot;print&quot;</span> in this example to return true
        even when the disk is full), it is dangerous to ignore its result. So
        when it happens implicitly, perl will signal errors by warning.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><b>Prior to version 5.22.0, perl ignored such errors</b>, so
        the common idiom shown above was liable to cause <b>silent data
        loss</b>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Warning: Use of &quot;%s&quot; without parentheses is ambiguous</dt>
  <dd>(S ambiguous) You wrote a unary operator followed by something that looks
      like a binary operator that could also have been interpreted as a term or
      unary operator. For instance, if you know that the rand function has a
      default argument of 1.0, and you write
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    rand + 5;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">you may THINK you wrote the same thing as</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    rand() + 5;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">but in actual fact, you got</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    rand(+5);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">So put in parentheses to say what you really mean.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>when is experimental</dt>
  <dd>(S experimental::smartmatch) <span class="Li">&quot;when&quot;</span>
      depends on smartmatch, which is experimental. Additionally, it has several
      special cases that may not be immediately obvious, and their behavior may
      change or even be removed in any future release of perl. See the
      explanation under &quot;Experimental Details on given and when&quot; in
      perlsyn.</dd>
  <dt>Wide character in %s</dt>
  <dd>(S utf8) Perl met a wide character (ordinal &gt;255) when it wasn't
      expecting one. This warning is by default on for I/O (like print).
    <p class="Pp">If this warning does come from I/O, the easiest way to quiet
        it is simply to add the <span class="Li">&quot;:utf8&quot;</span> layer,
        <i>e.g.</i>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;binmode&#x00A0;STDOUT,&#x00A0;':utf8'&quot;</span>.
        Another way to turn off the warning is to add
        <span class="Li">&quot;no&#x00A0;warnings&#x00A0;'utf8';&quot;</span>
        but that is often closer to cheating. In general, you are supposed to
        explicitly mark the filehandle with an encoding, see open and
        &quot;binmode&quot; in perlfunc.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If the warning comes from other than I/O, this diagnostic
        probably indicates that incorrect results are being obtained. You should
        examine your code to determine how a wide character is getting to an
        operation that doesn't handle them.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Wide character (U+%X) in %s</dt>
  <dd>(W locale) While in a single-byte locale (<i>i.e.</i>, a non-UTF-8 one), a
      multi-byte character was encountered. Perl considers this character to be
      the specified Unicode code point. Combining non-UTF-8 locales and Unicode
      is dangerous. Almost certainly some characters will have two different
      representations. For example, in the ISO 8859-7 (Greek) locale, the code
      point 0xC3 represents a Capital Gamma. But so also does 0x393. This will
      make string comparisons unreliable.
    <p class="Pp">You likely need to figure out how this multi-byte character
        got mixed up with your single-byte locale (or perhaps you thought you
        had a UTF-8 locale, but Perl disagrees).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Within []-length '%c' not allowed</dt>
  <dd>(F) The count in the (un)pack template may be replaced by
      <span class="Li">&quot;[TEMPLATE]&quot;</span> only if
      <span class="Li">&quot;TEMPLATE&quot;</span> always matches the same
      amount of packed bytes that can be determined from the template alone.
      This is not possible if it contains any of the codes @, /, U, u, w or a
      *-length. Redesign the template.</dd>
  <dt>%s() with negative argument</dt>
  <dd>(S misc) Certain operations make no sense with negative arguments. Warning
      is given and the operation is not done.</dd>
  <dt><b>write()</b> on closed filehandle %s</dt>
  <dd>(W closed) The filehandle you're writing to got itself closed sometime
      before now. Check your control flow.</dd>
  <dt>%s &quot;\x%X&quot; does not map to Unicode</dt>
  <dd>(S utf8) When reading in different encodings, Perl tries to map everything
      into Unicode characters. The bytes you read in are not legal in this
      encoding. For example
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    utf8 &quot;\xE4&quot; does not map to Unicode
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">if you try to read in the a-diaereses Latin-1 as UTF-8.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>'X' outside of string</dt>
  <dd>(F) You had a (un)pack template that specified a relative position before
      the beginning of the string being (un)packed. See &quot;pack&quot; in
      perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt>'x' outside of string in unpack</dt>
  <dd>(F) You had a pack template that specified a relative position after the
      end of the string being unpacked. See &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt>YOU HAVEN'T DISABLED SET-ID SCRIPTS IN THE KERNEL YET!</dt>
  <dd>(F) And you probably never will, because you probably don't have the
      sources to your kernel, and your vendor probably doesn't give a rip about
      what you want. There is a vulnerability anywhere that you have a set-id
      script, and to close it you need to remove the set-id bit from the script
      that you're attempting to run. To actually run the script set-id, your
      best bet is to put a set-id C wrapper around your script.</dd>
  <dt>You need to quote &quot;%s&quot;</dt>
  <dd>(W syntax) You assigned a bareword as a signal handler name.
      Unfortunately, you already have a subroutine of that name declared, which
      means that Perl 5 will try to call the subroutine when the assignment is
      executed, which is probably not what you want. (If it IS what you want,
      put an &amp; in front.)</dd>
  <dt>Your random numbers are not that random</dt>
  <dd>(F) When trying to initialize the random seed for hashes, Perl could not
      get any randomness out of your system. This usually indicates Something
      Very Wrong.</dd>
  <dt>Zero length \N{} in regex; marked by &lt;--&#x00A0;HERE in m/%s/</dt>
  <dd>(F) Named Unicode character escapes
      (<span class="Li">&quot;\N{...}&quot;</span>) may return a zero-length
      sequence. Such an escape was used in an extended character class, i.e.
      <span class="Li">&quot;(?[...])&quot;</span>, or under
      <span class="Li">&quot;use re 'strict'&quot;</span>, which is not
      permitted. Check that the correct escape has been used, and the correct
      charnames handler is in scope. The &lt;--&#x00A0;HERE shows whereabouts in
      the regular expression the problem was discovered.</dd>
