  Fixes</a></h1>

  <li>A bug has been fixed that would cause a &quot;Use of freed value in
      iteration&quot; error if the next two hash elements that would be iterated
      over are deleted. [perl #85026]</li>
  <li>Passing the same constant subroutine to both
      <span class="Li">&quot;index&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;formline&quot;</span> no longer causes one or the
      other to fail. [perl #89218]</li>
  <li>5.14.0 introduced some memory leaks in regular expression character
      classes such as <span class="Li">&quot;[\w\s]&quot;</span>, which have now
      been fixed.</li>
  <li>An edge case in regular expression matching could potentially loop. This
      happened only under <span class="Li">&quot;/i&quot;</span> in bracketed
      character classes that have characters with multi-character folds, and the
      target string to match against includes the first portion of the fold,
      followed by another character that has a multi-character fold that begins
      with the remaining portion of the fold, plus some more.
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre> &quot;s\N{U+DF}&quot; =~ /[\x{DF}foo]/i
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">is one such case. <span class="Li">&quot;\xDF&quot;</span>
        folds to <span class="Li">&quot;ss&quot;</span>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Several Unicode case-folding bugs have been fixed.</li>
  <li>The new (in 5.14.0) regular expression modifier
      <span class="Li">&quot;/a&quot;</span> when repeated like
      <span class="Li">&quot;/aa&quot;</span> forbids the characters outside the
      ASCII range that match characters inside that range from matching under
      <span class="Li">&quot;/i&quot;</span>. This did not work under some
      circumstances, all involving alternation, such as:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre> &quot;\N{KELVIN SIGN}&quot; =~ /k|foo/iaa;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">succeeded inappropriately. This is now fixed.</p>

  <li>Fixed a case where it was possible that a freed buffer may have been read
      from when parsing a here document.</li>

  Bugs</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles
    recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug
    database at http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ . There may also be information at
    http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug
    program included with your release. Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny
    but sufficient test case. Your bug report, along with the output of
    <span class="Li">&quot;perl -V&quot;</span>, will be sent off to
    perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make
    it inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please
    send it to perl5-security-report@perl.org. This points to a closed
    subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core
    committers, who be able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a
    resolution, and help co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix
    the problem across all platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use
    this address for security issues in the Perl core, not for modules
    independently distributed on CPAN.</p>
