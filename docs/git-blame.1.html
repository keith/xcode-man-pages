Annotates each line in the given file with information from the revision which
  last modified the line. Optionally, start annotating from the given revision.
<p class="Pp">When specified one or more times, <b>-L</b> restricts annotation
    to the requested lines.</p>
<p class="Pp">The origin of lines is automatically followed across whole-file
    renames (currently there is no option to turn the rename-following off). To
    follow lines moved from one file to another, or to follow lines that were
    copied and pasted from another file, etc., see the <b>-C</b> and <b>-M</b>
    options.</p>
<p class="Pp">The report does not tell you anything about lines which have been
    deleted or replaced; you need to use a tool such as <i>git diff</i> or the
    &quot;pickaxe&quot; interface briefly mentioned in the following
  paragraph.</p>
<p class="Pp">Apart from supporting file annotation, Git also supports searching
    the development history for when a code snippet occurred in a change. This
    makes it possible to track when a code snippet was added to a file, moved or
    copied between files, and eventually deleted or replaced. It works by
    searching for a text string in the diff. A small example of the pickaxe
    interface that searches for <b>blame_usage</b>:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">

<p class="Pp">-L &lt;start&gt;,&lt;end&gt;, -L :&lt;funcname&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Annotate only the given line range. May be specified
  multiple times. Overlapping ranges are allowed.
<p class="Pp">&lt;start&gt; and &lt;end&gt; are optional. &#x201C;-L
    &lt;start&gt;&#x201D; or &#x201C;-L &lt;start&gt;,&#x201D; spans from
    &lt;start&gt; to end of file. &#x201C;-L ,&lt;end&gt;&#x201D; spans from

<p class="Pp">&lt;start&gt; and &lt;end&gt; can take one of these forms:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;number
<p class="Pp">If &lt;start&gt; or &lt;end&gt; is a number, it specifies an
    absolute line number (lines count from 1).</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;/regex/
<p class="Pp">This form will use the first line matching the given POSIX regex.
    If &lt;start&gt; is a regex, it will search from the end of the previous
    <b>-L</b> range, if any, otherwise from the start of file. If &lt;start&gt;
    is &#x201C;^/regex/&#x201D;, it will search from the start of file. If
    &lt;end&gt; is a regex, it will search starting at the line given by
    &lt;start&gt;.</p>

<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;+offset or -offset
<p class="Pp">This is only valid for &lt;end&gt; and will specify a number of

</div>
<p class="Pp">If &#x201C;:&lt;funcname&gt;&#x201D; is given in place of
    &lt;start&gt; and &lt;end&gt;, it is a regular expression that denotes the
    range from the first funcname line that matches &lt;funcname&gt;, up to the
    next funcname line. &#x201C;:&lt;funcname&gt;&#x201D; searches from the end
    of the previous <b>-L</b> range, if any, otherwise from the start of file.
    &#x201C;^:&lt;funcname&gt;&#x201D; searches from the start of file.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">-l</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show long rev (Default: off).</div>
<p class="Pp">-t</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show raw timestamp (Default: off).</div>
<p class="Pp">-S &lt;revs-file&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Use revisions from revs-file instead of calling
  <b>git-rev-list</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">--reverse &lt;rev&gt;..&lt;rev&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Walk history forward instead of backward. Instead of
  showing the revision in which a line appeared, this shows the last revision in
  which a line has existed. This requires a range of revision like START..END
  where the path to blame exists in START. <b>git blame --reverse START</b> is
  taken as <b>git blame --reverse START..HEAD</b> for convenience.</div>
<p class="Pp">-p, --porcelain</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show in a format designed for machine consumption.</div>
<p class="Pp">--line-porcelain</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show the porcelain format, but output commit information
  for each line, not just the first time a commit is referenced. Implies
  --porcelain.</div>
<p class="Pp">--incremental</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show the result incrementally in a format designed for
  machine consumption.</div>
<p class="Pp">--encoding=&lt;encoding&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Specifies the encoding used to output author names and
  commit summaries. Setting it to <b>none</b> makes blame output unconverted
  data. For more information see the discussion about encoding in the
  <b>git-log</b>(1) manual page.</div>
<p class="Pp">--contents &lt;file&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When &lt;rev&gt; is not specified, the command annotates
  the changes starting backwards from the working tree copy. This flag makes the
  command pretend as if the working tree copy has the contents of the named file
  (specify <b>-</b> to make the command read from the standard input).</div>
<p class="Pp">--date &lt;format&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Specifies the format used to output dates. If --date is
  not provided, the value of the blame.date config variable is used. If the
  blame.date config variable is also not set, the iso format is used. For
  supported values, see the discussion of the --date option at
  <b>git-log</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">--[no-]progress</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Progress status is reported on the standard error stream
  by default when it is attached to a terminal. This flag enables progress
  reporting even if not attached to a terminal. Can&#x2019;t use
  <b>--progress</b> together with <b>--porcelain</b> or
  <b>--incremental</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">-M[&lt;num&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Detect moved or copied lines within a file. When a commit
  moves or copies a block of lines (e.g. the original file has A and then B, and
  the commit changes it to B and then A), the traditional <i>blame</i> algorithm
  notices only half of the movement and typically blames the lines that were
  moved up (i.e. B) to the parent and assigns blame to the lines that were moved
  down (i.e. A) to the child commit. With this option, both groups of lines are
  blamed on the parent by running extra passes of inspection.
<p class="Pp">&lt;num&gt; is optional but it is the lower bound on the number of
    alphanumeric characters that Git must detect as moving/copying within a file
    for it to associate those lines with the parent commit. The default value is
    20.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">-C[&lt;num&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">In addition to <b>-M</b>, detect lines moved or copied
  from other files that were modified in the same commit. This is useful when
  you reorganize your program and move code around across files. When this
  option is given twice, the command additionally looks for copies from other
  files in the commit that creates the file. When this option is given three
  times, the command additionally looks for copies from other files in any
  commit.
<p class="Pp">&lt;num&gt; is optional but it is the lower bound on the number of
    alphanumeric characters that Git must detect as moving/copying between files
    for it to associate those lines with the parent commit. And the default
    value is 40. If there are more than one <b>-C</b> options given, the
    &lt;num&gt; argument of the last <b>-C</b> will take effect.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">-h</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show help message.</div>
<p class="Pp">-c</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Use the same output mode as <b>git-annotate</b>(1)
  (Default: off).</div>
<p class="Pp">--score-debug</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Include debugging information related to the movement of
  lines between files (see <b>-C</b>) and lines moved within a file (see
  <b>-M</b>). The first number listed is the score. This is the number of
  alphanumeric characters detected as having been moved between or within files.
  This must be above a certain threshold for <i>git blame</i> to consider those
  lines of code to have been moved.</div>
<p class="Pp">-f, --show-name</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show the filename in the original commit. By default the
  filename is shown if there is any line that came from a file with a different
  name, due to rename detection.</div>
<p class="Pp">-n, --show-number</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show the line number in the original commit (Default:
  off).</div>
<p class="Pp">-s</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Suppress the author name and timestamp from the
  output.</div>
<p class="Pp">-e, --show-email</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show the author email instead of author name (Default:
  off). This can also be controlled via the <b>blame.showEmail</b> config
  option.</div>
<p class="Pp">-w</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Ignore whitespace when comparing the parent&#x2019;s
  version and the child&#x2019;s to find where the lines came from.</div>
<p class="Pp">--abbrev=&lt;n&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Instead of using the default 7+1 hexadecimal digits as
  the abbreviated object name, use &lt;n&gt;+1 digits. Note that 1 column is
  used for a caret to mark the boundary commit.</div>

<h1 class="Sh" id="THE_PORCELAIN_FORMAT"><a class="permalink" href="#THE_PORCELAIN_FORMAT">THE
  PORCELAIN FORMAT</a></h1>
In this format, each line is output after a header; the header at the minimum
  has the first line which has:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;40-byte SHA-1 of the commit the line is
  attributed to;</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;the line number of the line in the original
  file;</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;the line number of the line in the final
  file;</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;on a line that starts a group of lines from a
  different commit than the previous one, the number of lines in this group. On
  subsequent lines this field is absent.</div>
<p class="Pp">This header line is followed by the following information at least
    once for each commit:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;the author name (&quot;author&quot;), email
  (&quot;author-mail&quot;), time (&quot;author-time&quot;), and time zone
  (&quot;author-tz&quot;); similarly for committer.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;the filename in the commit that the line is
  attributed to.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;the first line of the commit log message
  (&quot;summary&quot;).</div>
<p class="Pp">The contents of the actual line is output after the above header,
    prefixed by a TAB. This is to allow adding more header elements later.</p>
<p class="Pp">The porcelain format generally suppresses commit information that
    has already been seen. For example, two lines that are blamed to the same
    commit will both be shown, but the details for that commit will be shown
    only once. This is more efficient, but may require more state be kept by the
    reader. The <b>--line-porcelain</b> option can be used to output full commit
    information for each line, allowing simpler (but less efficient) usage
  like:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
# count the number of lines attributed to each author
git blame --line-porcelain file |
sed -n 's/^author //p' |
sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
</pre>

<h1 class="Sh" id="SPECIFYING_RANGES"><a class="permalink" href="#SPECIFYING_RANGES">SPECIFYING
  RANGES</a></h1>
Unlike <i>git blame</i> and <i>git annotate</i> in older versions of git, the
  extent of the annotation can be limited to both line ranges and revision
  ranges. The <b>-L</b> option, which limits annotation to a range of lines, may
  be specified multiple times.
<p class="Pp">When you are interested in finding the origin for lines 40-60 for
    file <b>foo</b>, you can use the <b>-L</b> option like so (they mean the
    same thing &#x2014; both ask for 21 lines starting at line 40):</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
git blame -L 40,60 foo
git blame -L 40,+21 foo
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Also you can use a regular expression to specify the line
  range:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
git blame -L '/^sub hello {/,/^}$/' foo
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">which limits the annotation to the body of the <b>hello</b>
    subroutine.</p>
<p class="Pp">When you are not interested in changes older than version v2.6.18,
    or changes older than 3 weeks, you can use revision range specifiers similar
    to <i>git rev-list</i>:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
git blame v2.6.18.. -- foo
git blame --since=3.weeks -- foo
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">When revision range specifiers are used to limit the annotation,
    lines that have not changed since the range boundary (either the commit
    v2.6.18 or the most recent commit that is more than 3 weeks old in the above
    example) are blamed for that range boundary commit.</p>
<p class="Pp">A particularly useful way is to see if an added file has lines
    created by copy-and-paste from existing files. Sometimes this indicates that
    the developer was being sloppy and did not refactor the code properly. You
    can first find the commit that introduced the file with:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
git log --diff-filter=A --pretty=short -- foo
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">and then annotate the change between the commit and its parents,
    using <b>commit^!</b> notation:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
git blame -C -C -f $commit^! -- foo
</pre>
</div>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="INCREMENTAL_OUTPUT"><a class="permalink" href="#INCREMENTAL_OUTPUT">INCREMENTAL
  OUTPUT</a></h1>
When called with <b>--incremental</b> option, the command outputs the result as
  it is built. The output generally will talk about lines touched by more recent
  commits first (i.e. the lines will be annotated out of order) and is meant to
  be used by interactive viewers.
<p class="Pp">The output format is similar to the Porcelain format, but it does
    not contain the actual lines from the file that is being annotated.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 1.Each blame entry always starts with a line of:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
&lt;40-byte hex sha1&gt; &lt;sourceline&gt; &lt;resultline&gt; &lt;num_lines&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Line numbers count from 1.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 2.The first time that a commit shows up in the stream,
  it has various other information about it printed out with a one-word tag at
  the beginning of each line describing the extra commit information (author,
  email, committer, dates, summary, etc.).</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 3.Unlike the Porcelain format, the filename information
  is always given and terminates the entry:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
&quot;filename&quot; &lt;whitespace-quoted-filename-goes-here&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">and thus it is really quite easy to parse for some line- and
    word-oriented parser (which should be quite natural for most scripting
    languages).</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<br/>
<b>Note</b>
<br/>
For people who do parsing: to make it more robust, just ignore any lines between
  the first and last one (&quot;&lt;sha1&gt;&quot; and &quot;filename&quot;
  lines) where you do not recognize the tag words (or care about that particular
  one) at the beginning of the &quot;extended information&quot; lines. That way,
  if there is ever added information (like the commit encoding or extended
  commit commentary), a blame viewer will not care.

<h1 class="Sh" id="MAPPING_AUTHORS"><a class="permalink" href="#MAPPING_AUTHORS">MAPPING
  AUTHORS</a></h1>
If the file <b>.mailmap</b> exists at the toplevel of the repository, or at the
  location pointed to by the mailmap.file or mailmap.blob configuration options,
  it is used to map author and committer names and email addresses to canonical
  real names and email addresses.
<p class="Pp">In the simple form, each line in the file consists of the
    canonical real name of an author, whitespace, and an email address used in
    the commit (enclosed by <i>&lt;</i> and <i>&gt;</i>) to map to the name. For
    example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
Proper Name &lt;commit@email.xx&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The more complex forms are:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
&lt;proper@email.xx&gt; &lt;commit@email.xx&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">which allows mailmap to replace only the email part of a commit,
    and:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
Proper Name &lt;proper@email.xx&gt; &lt;commit@email.xx&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">which allows mailmap to replace both the name and the email of a
    commit matching the specified commit email address, and:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
Proper Name &lt;proper@email.xx&gt; Commit Name &lt;commit@email.xx&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">which allows mailmap to replace both the name and the email of a
    commit matching both the specified commit name and email address.</p>
<p class="Pp">Example 1: Your history contains commits by two authors, Jane and
    Joe, whose names appear in the repository under several forms:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
Joe Developer &lt;joe@example.com&gt;
Joe R. Developer &lt;joe@example.com&gt;
Jane Doe &lt;jane@example.com&gt;
Jane Doe &lt;jane@laptop.(none)&gt;
Jane D. &lt;jane@desktop.(none)&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">Now suppose that Joe wants his middle name initial used, and Jane
    prefers her family name fully spelled out. A proper <b>.mailmap</b> file
    would look like:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
Jane Doe         &lt;jane@desktop.(none)&gt;
Joe R. Developer &lt;joe@example.com&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">Note how there is no need for an entry for
    <b>&lt;jane@laptop.(none)&gt;</b>, because the real name of that author is
    already correct.</p>
<p class="Pp">Example 2: Your repository contains commits from the following
    authors:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
nick1 &lt;bugs@company.xx&gt;
nick2 &lt;bugs@company.xx&gt;
nick2 &lt;nick2@company.xx&gt;
santa &lt;me@company.xx&gt;
claus &lt;me@company.xx&gt;
CTO &lt;cto@coompany.xx&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">Then you might want a <b>.mailmap</b> file that looks like:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
&lt;cto@company.xx&gt;                       &lt;cto@coompany.xx&gt;
