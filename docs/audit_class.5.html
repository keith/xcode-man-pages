<p class="Pp">The <code class="Nm">audit_class</code> file contains descriptions
    of the auditable event classes on the system. Each auditable event is a
    member of an event class. Each line maps an audit event mask (bitmap) to a
    class and a description. Entries are of the form:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd
  Bd-indent"><var class="Ar">classmask</var>:<var class="Ar">eventclass</var>:<var class="Ar">description</var></div>

<p class="Pp">The audit class <span class="Pa">res</span> is reserved for
    internal use. Unentitled applications can still modify the event class
    preselection mask for an audit event (for example by using the
    <a class="Xr">audit_event(5)</a> configuration file or the
    <a class="Xr">auditon(2)</a> system call with the A_SETCLASS command),
    however these applications will not be able to change the
    <span class="Pa">res</span> audit class mask for that event.</p>
