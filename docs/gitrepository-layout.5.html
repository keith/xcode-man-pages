<p class="Pp">A Git repository comes in two different flavours:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;a <b>.git</b> directory at the root of the
  working tree;</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;a <b>&lt;project&gt;.git</b> directory that is a
  <i>bare</i> repository (i.e. without its own working tree), that is typically
  used for exchanging histories with others by pushing into it and fetching from
  it.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>Note</b>: Also you can have a plain text file <b>.git</b> at
    the root of your working tree, containing <b>gitdir: &lt;path&gt;</b> to
    point at the real directory that has the repository. This mechanism is often
    used for a working tree of a submodule checkout, to allow you in the
    containing superproject to <b>git checkout</b> a branch that does not have
    the submodule. The <b>checkout</b> has to remove the entire submodule
    working tree, without losing the submodule repository.</p>
<p class="Pp">These things may exist in a Git repository.</p>
<p class="Pp">objects</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Object store associated with this repository. Usually an
  object store is self sufficient (i.e. all the objects that are referred to by
  an object found in it are also found in it), but there are a few ways to
  violate it.
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 1.You could have an incomplete but locally usable
  repository by creating a shallow clone. See <b>git-clone</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 2.You could be using the <b>objects/info/alternates</b>
  or <b>$GIT_ALTERNATE_OBJECT_DIRECTORIES</b> mechanisms to <i>borrow</i>
  objects from other object stores. A repository with this kind of incomplete
  object store is not suitable to be published for use with dumb transports but
  otherwise is OK as long as <b>objects/info/alternates</b> points at the object
  stores it borrows from.
<p class="Pp">This directory is ignored if $GIT_COMMON_DIR is set and
    &quot;$GIT_COMMON_DIR/objects&quot; will be used instead.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp">objects/[0-9a-f][0-9a-f]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A newly created object is stored in its own file. The
  objects are splayed over 256 subdirectories using the first two characters of
  the sha1 object name to keep the number of directory entries in <b>objects</b>
  itself to a manageable number. Objects found here are often called
  <i>unpacked</i> (or <i>loose</i>) objects.</div>
<p class="Pp">objects/pack</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Packs (files that store many objects in compressed form,
  along with index files to allow them to be randomly accessed) are found in
  this directory.</div>
<p class="Pp">objects/info</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Additional information about the object store is recorded
  in this directory.</div>
<p class="Pp">objects/info/packs</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This file is to help dumb transports discover what packs
  are available in this object store. Whenever a pack is added or removed,
  <b>git update-server-info</b> should be run to keep this file up to date if
  the repository is published for dumb transports. <i>git repack</i> does this
  by default.</div>
<p class="Pp">objects/info/alternates</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This file records paths to alternate object stores that
  this object store borrows objects from, one pathname per line. Note that not
  only native Git tools use it locally, but the HTTP fetcher also tries to use
  it remotely; this will usually work if you have relative paths (relative to
  the object database, not to the repository!) in your alternates file, but it
  will not work if you use absolute paths unless the absolute path in filesystem
  and web URL is the same. See also <b>objects/info/http-alternates</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">objects/info/http-alternates</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This file records URLs to alternate object stores that
  this object store borrows objects from, to be used when the repository is
  fetched over HTTP.</div>
<p class="Pp">refs</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">References are stored in subdirectories of this
  directory. The <i>git prune</i> command knows to preserve objects reachable
  from refs found in this directory and its subdirectories. This directory is
  ignored (except refs/bisect, refs/rewritten and refs/worktree) if
  $GIT_COMMON_DIR is set and &quot;$GIT_COMMON_DIR/refs&quot; will be used
  instead.</div>
<p class="Pp">refs/heads/<b>name</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">records tip-of-the-tree commit objects of branch
  <b>name</b></div>
<p class="Pp">refs/tags/<b>name</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">records any object name (not necessarily a commit object,
  or a tag object that points at a commit object).</div>
<p class="Pp">refs/remotes/<b>name</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">records tip-of-the-tree commit objects of branches copied
  from a remote repository.</div>
<p class="Pp">refs/replace/<b>&lt;obj-sha1&gt;</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">records the SHA-1 of the object that replaces
  <b>&lt;obj-sha1&gt;</b>. This is similar to info/grafts and is internally used
  and maintained by <b>git-replace</b>(1). Such refs can be exchanged between
  repositories while grafts are not.</div>
<p class="Pp">packed-refs</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">records the same information as refs/heads/, refs/tags/,
  and friends record in a more efficient way. See <b>git-pack-refs</b>(1). This
  file is ignored if $GIT_COMMON_DIR is set and
  &quot;$GIT_COMMON_DIR/packed-refs&quot; will be used instead.</div>
<p class="Pp">HEAD</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A symref (see glossary) to the <b>refs/heads/</b>
  namespace describing the currently active branch. It does not mean much if the
  repository is not associated with any working tree (i.e. a <i>bare</i>
  repository), but a valid Git repository <b>must</b> have the HEAD file; some
  porcelains may use it to guess the designated &quot;default&quot; branch of
  the repository (usually <i>master</i>). It is legal if the named branch
  <i>name</i> does not (yet) exist. In some legacy setups, it is a symbolic link
  instead of a symref that points at the current branch.
<p class="Pp">HEAD can also record a specific commit directly, instead of being
    a symref to point at the current branch. Such a state is often called
    <i>detached HEAD.</i> See <b>git-checkout</b>(1) for details.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">config</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Repository specific configuration file. This file is
  ignored if $GIT_COMMON_DIR is set and &quot;$GIT_COMMON_DIR/config&quot; will
  be used instead.</div>
<p class="Pp">config.worktree</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Working directory specific configuration file for the
  main working directory in multiple working directory setup (see
  <b>git-worktree</b>(1)).</div>
<p class="Pp">branches</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A slightly deprecated way to store shorthands to be used
  to specify a URL to <i>git fetch</i>, <i>git pull</i> and <i>git push</i>. A
  file can be stored as <b>branches/&lt;name&gt;</b> and then <i>name</i> can be
  given to these commands in place of <i>repository</i> argument. See the
  REMOTES section in <b>git-fetch</b>(1) for details. This mechanism is legacy
  and not likely to be found in modern repositories. This directory is ignored
  if $GIT_COMMON_DIR is set and &quot;$GIT_COMMON_DIR/branches&quot; will be
  used instead.</div>
<p class="Pp">hooks</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Hooks are customization scripts used by various Git
  commands. A handful of sample hooks are installed when <i>git init</i> is run,
  but all of them are disabled by default. To enable, the <b>.sample</b> suffix
  has to be removed from the filename by renaming. Read <b>githooks</b>(5) for
  more details about each hook. This directory is ignored if $GIT_COMMON_DIR is
  set and &quot;$GIT_COMMON_DIR/hooks&quot; will be used instead.</div>
<p class="Pp">common</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When multiple working trees are used, most of files in
  $GIT_DIR are per-worktree with a few known exceptions. All files under
  <i>common</i> however will be shared between all working trees.</div>
<p class="Pp">index</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The current index file for the repository. It is usually
  not found in a bare repository.</div>
<p class="Pp">sharedindex.&lt;SHA-1&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The shared index part, to be referenced by $GIT_DIR/index
  and other temporary index files. Only valid in split index mode.</div>
<p class="Pp">info</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Additional information about the repository is recorded
  in this directory. This directory is ignored if $GIT_COMMON_DIR is set and
  &quot;$GIT_COMMON_DIR/info&quot; will be used instead.</div>
<p class="Pp">info/refs</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This file helps dumb transports discover what refs are
  available in this repository. If the repository is published for dumb
  transports, this file should be regenerated by <i>git update-server-info</i>
  every time a tag or branch is created or modified. This is normally done from
  the <b>hooks/update</b> hook, which is run by the <i>git-receive-pack</i>
  command when you <i>git push</i> into the repository.</div>
<p class="Pp">info/grafts</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This file records fake commit ancestry information, to
  pretend the set of parents a commit has is different from how the commit was
  actually created. One record per line describes a commit and its fake parents
  by listing their 40-byte hexadecimal object names separated by a space and
  terminated by a newline.
<p class="Pp">Note that the grafts mechanism is outdated and can lead to
    problems transferring objects between repositories; see
    <b>git-replace</b>(1) for a more flexible and robust system to do the same
    thing.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">info/exclude</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This file, by convention among Porcelains, stores the
  exclude pattern list. <b>.gitignore</b> is the per-directory ignore file.
  <i>git status</i>, <i>git add</i>, <i>git rm</i> and <i>git clean</i> look at
  it but the core Git commands do not look at it. See also:
  <b>gitignore</b>(5).</div>
<p class="Pp">info/attributes</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Defines which attributes to assign to a path, similar to
  per-directory <b>.gitattributes</b> files. See also:
  <b>gitattributes</b>(5).</div>
<p class="Pp">info/sparse-checkout</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This file stores sparse checkout patterns. See also:
  <b>git-read-tree</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">remotes</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Stores shorthands for URL and default refnames for use
  when interacting with remote repositories via <i>git fetch</i>, <i>git
  pull</i> and <i>git push</i> commands. See the REMOTES section in
  <b>git-fetch</b>(1) for details. This mechanism is legacy and not likely to be
  found in modern repositories. This directory is ignored if $GIT_COMMON_DIR is
  set and &quot;$GIT_COMMON_DIR/remotes&quot; will be used instead.</div>
<p class="Pp">logs</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Records of changes made to refs are stored in this
  directory. See <b>git-update-ref</b>(1) for more information. This directory
  is ignored (except logs/HEAD) if $GIT_COMMON_DIR is set and
  &quot;$GIT_COMMON_DIR/logs&quot; will be used instead.</div>
<p class="Pp">logs/refs/heads/<b>name</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Records all changes made to the branch tip named
  <b>name</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">logs/refs/tags/<b>name</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Records all changes made to the tag named
  <b>name</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">shallow</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This is similar to <b>info/grafts</b> but is internally
  used and maintained by shallow clone mechanism. See <b>--depth</b> option to
  <b>git-clone</b>(1) and <b>git-fetch</b>(1). This file is ignored if
  $GIT_COMMON_DIR is set and &quot;$GIT_COMMON_DIR/shallow&quot; will be used
  instead.</div>
<p class="Pp">commondir</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If this file exists, $GIT_COMMON_DIR (see <b>git</b>(1))
  will be set to the path specified in this file if it is not explicitly set. If
  the specified path is relative, it is relative to $GIT_DIR. The repository
  with commondir is incomplete without the repository pointed by
  &quot;commondir&quot;.</div>
<p class="Pp">modules</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Contains the git-repositories of the submodules.</div>
<p class="Pp">worktrees</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Contains administrative data for linked working trees.
  Each subdirectory contains the working tree-related part of a linked working
  tree. This directory is ignored if $GIT_COMMON_DIR is set, in which case
  &quot;$GIT_COMMON_DIR/worktrees&quot; will be used instead.</div>
<p class="Pp">worktrees/&lt;id&gt;/gitdir</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A text file containing the absolute path back to the .git
  file that points to here. This is used to check if the linked repository has
  been manually removed and there is no need to keep this directory any more.
  The mtime of this file should be updated every time the linked repository is
  accessed.</div>
<p class="Pp">worktrees/&lt;id&gt;/locked</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If this file exists, the linked working tree may be on a
  portable device and not available. The presence of this file prevents
  <b>worktrees/&lt;id&gt;</b> from being pruned either automatically or manually
  by <b>git worktree prune</b>. The file may contain a string explaining why the
  repository is locked.</div>
<p class="Pp">worktrees/&lt;id&gt;/config.worktree</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Working directory specific configuration file.</div>

<h1 class="Sh" id="GIT_REPOSITORY_FORMAT_VERSIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#GIT_REPOSITORY_FORMAT_VERSIONS">GIT
  REPOSITORY FORMAT VERSIONS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Every git repository is marked with a numeric version in the
    <b>core.repositoryformatversion</b> key of its <b>config</b> file. This
    version specifies the rules for operating on the on-disk repository data. An
    implementation of git which does not understand a particular version
    advertised by an on-disk repository MUST NOT operate on that repository;
    doing so risks not only producing wrong results, but actually losing
  data.</p>
<p class="Pp">Because of this rule, version bumps should be kept to an absolute
    minimum. Instead, we generally prefer these strategies:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;bumping format version numbers of individual data
  files (e.g., index, packfiles, etc). This restricts the incompatibilities only
  to those files.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;introducing new data that gracefully degrades
  when used by older clients (e.g., pack bitmap files are ignored by older
  clients, which simply do not take advantage of the optimization they
  provide).</div>
<p class="Pp">A whole-repository format version bump should only be part of a
    change that cannot be independently versioned. For instance, if one were to
    change the reachability rules for objects, or the rules for locking refs,
    that would require a bump of the repository format version.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that this applies only to accessing the repository&#x2019;s
    disk contents directly. An older client which understands only format
    <b>0</b> may still connect via <b>git://</b> to a repository using format
    <b>1</b>, as long as the server process understands format <b>1</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The preferred strategy for rolling out a version bump (whether
    whole repository or for a single file) is to teach git to read the new
    format, and allow writing the new format with a config switch or command
    line option (for experimentation or for those who do not care about
    backwards compatibility with older gits). Then after a long period to allow
    the reading capability to become common, we may switch to writing the new
    format by default.</p>
<p class="Pp">The currently defined format versions are:</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">Version <b>0</b></h2>
<p class="Pp">This is the format defined by the initial version of git,
    including but not limited to the format of the repository directory, the
    repository configuration file, and the object and ref storage. Specifying
    the complete behavior of git is beyond the scope of this document.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">Version <b>1</b></h2>
<p class="Pp">This format is identical to version <b>0</b>, with the following
    exceptions:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 1.When reading the <b>core.repositoryformatversion</b>
  variable, a git implementation which supports version 1 MUST also read any
  configuration keys found in the <b>extensions</b> section of the configuration
  file.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 2.If a version-1 repository specifies any
  <b>extensions.*</b> keys that the running git has not implemented, the
  operation MUST NOT proceed. Similarly, if the value of any known key is not
  understood by the implementation, the operation MUST NOT proceed.</div>
<p class="Pp">Note that if no extensions are specified in the config file, then
    <b>core.repositoryformatversion</b> SHOULD be set to <b>0</b> (setting it to
    <b>1</b> provides no benefit, and makes the repository incompatible with
    older implementations of git).</p>
<p class="Pp">This document will serve as the master list for extensions. Any
    implementation wishing to define a new extension should make a note of it
    here, in order to claim the name.</p>
<p class="Pp">The defined extensions are:</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>noop</b>
  <br/>
</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">This extension does not change git&#x2019;s behavior at all. It is
    useful only for testing format-1 compatibility.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>preciousObjects</b>
  <br/>
</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">When the config key <b>extensions.preciousObjects</b> is set to
    <b>true</b>, objects in the repository MUST NOT be deleted (e.g., by
    <b>git-prune</b> or <b>git repack -d</b>).</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>partialclone</b>
  <br/>
</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">When the config key <b>extensions.partialclone</b> is set, it
    indicates that the repo was created with a partial clone (or later performed
    a partial fetch) and that the remote may have omitted sending certain
    unwanted objects. Such a remote is called a &quot;promisor remote&quot; and
    it promises that all such omitted objects can be fetched from it in the
    future.</p>
<p class="Pp">The value of this key is the name of the promisor remote.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>worktreeConfig</b>
  <br/>
</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">If set, by default &quot;git config&quot; reads from both
    &quot;config&quot; and &quot;config.worktree&quot; file from GIT_DIR in that
    order. In multiple working directory mode, &quot;config&quot; file is shared
    while &quot;config.worktree&quot; is per-working directory (i.e.,
    it&#x2019;s in GIT_COMMON_DIR/worktrees/&lt;id&gt;/config.worktree)</p>
