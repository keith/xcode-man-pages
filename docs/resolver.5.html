<p class="Pp">The <a class="Xr">resolver(3)</a> is a set of routines in the C
    library which provide access to the Internet Domain Name System (DNS). The
    resolver configuration file contains information that is read by the
    resolver routines the first time they are invoked by a process. The file is
    designed to be human readable and contains a list of keywords with values
    that provide various types of resolver information.</p>
<p class="Pp">macOS supports a DNS search strategy that may involve multiple DNS
    resolver clients. See the <a class="Sx" href="#SEARCH_STRATEGY">SEARCH
    STRATEGY</a> section below for an overview of multi-client DNS search.</p>
<p class="Pp">Each DNS client is configured using the contents of a single
    configuration file of the format described below, or from a property list
    supplied from some other system configuration database. Note that the
    <span class="Pa">/etc/resolv.conf</span> file, which contains configuration
    for the default (or &quot;primary&quot;) DNS resolver client, is maintained
    automatically by macOS and should not be edited manually. Changes to the DNS
    configuration should be made by using the Network Preferences panel.</p>
<p class="Pp">The different configuration options are:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="nameserver"><a class="permalink" href="#nameserver"><b class="Sy">nameserver</b></a></dt>
  <dd>IPv4 or IPv6 address of a name server that the resolver should query. The
      address may optionally have a trailing dot followed by a port number. For
      example, <code class="Li">10.0.0.17.55</code> specifies that the
      nameserver at 10.0.0.17 uses port 55. Up to <code class="Dv">MAXNS</code>
      (currently 3) name servers may be listed, one per keyword. If there are
      multiple servers, the resolver library queries them in the order listed.
      If no <b class="Sy">nameserver</b> entries are present, the default is to
      use the name server on the local machine. (The algorithm used is to try a
      name server, and if the query times out, try the next, until out of name
      servers, then repeat trying all the name servers until a maximum number of
      retries are made).</dd>
  <dt id="port"><a class="permalink" href="#port"><b class="Sy">port</b></a></dt>
  <dd>IP port number to be used for this resolver. The default port is 53. The
      port number for an individual nameserver may be specified as part of the
      nameserver address (see <a class="Sx" href="#nameserver">nameserver</a>
      above) to override the default or the port number specified as a value for
      this keyword.</dd>
  <dt id="domain"><a class="permalink" href="#domain"><b class="Sy">domain</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Domain name associated with this resolver configuration. This option is
      normally not required by the macOS DNS search system when the resolver
      configuration is read from a file in the
      <span class="Pa">/etc/resolver</span> directory. In that case the file
      name is used as the domain name. However,
      <a class="Sx" href="#domain">domain</a> must be provided when there are
      multiple resolver clients for the same domain name, since multiple files
      may not exist having the same name. See the
      <a class="Sx" href="#SEARCH_STRATEGY">SEARCH STRATEGY</a> section for more
      details.</dd>
  <dt id="search"><a class="permalink" href="#search"><b class="Sy">search</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Search list for host-name lookup. This parameter is only used by the
      &quot;Super&quot; DNS resolver, which manages the DNS search strategy
      amongst multiple DNS resolver clients. Unqualified queries will be
      attempted using each component of the search path in turn until a match is
      found. Note that this process may be slow and will generate a lot of
      network traffic if the servers for the listed domains are not local, and
      that queries will time out if no server is available for one of the
      domains.
    <p class="Pp">The search list is currently limited to six domains with a
        total of 256 characters.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="search_order"><a class="permalink" href="#search_order"><b class="Sy">search_order</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Only required for those clients that share a domain name with other
      clients. Queries will be sent to these clients in order by ascending
      <a class="Sx" href="#search_order">search_order</a> value. For example,
      this allows two clients for the &quot;.local&quot; domain, which is used
      by Apple's multicast DNS, but which may also be used at some sites as
      private DNS domain name.</dd>
  <dt id="sortlist"><a class="permalink" href="#sortlist"><b class="Sy">sortlist</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Sortlist allows addresses returned by gethostbyname to be sorted. A
      sortlist is specified by IP address netmask pairs. If the netmask is not
      specified, it defaults to the historical Class A/B/C netmask of the net;
      this usage is deprecated. The IP address and network pairs are separated
      by slashes. Up to 10 pairs may be specified. E.g.,
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <div class="Bd Bd-indent"><code class="Li">sortlist 10.9.1.0/255.255.240.0
      10.9.0.0/255.255.0.0</code></div>
  </dd>
  <dt id="timeout"><a class="permalink" href="#timeout"><b class="Sy">timeout</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Specifies the total amount of time allowed for a name resolution. This
      time interval is divided by the number of nameservers and the number of
      retries allowed for each nameserver.</dd>
  <dt id="options"><a class="permalink" href="#options"><b class="Sy">options</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Options allows certain internal resolver variables to be modified. The
      syntax is
    <p class="Pp"><b>options</b> <i>option</i> <i>...</i></p>
    <p class="Pp" id="option">where
        <a class="permalink" href="#option"><b class="Sy">option</b></a> is one

      <dt id="ndots"><a class="permalink" href="#ndots"><b class="Sy">ndots</b></a>:<var class="Ar">n</var></dt>
      <dd>sets a threshold for the number of dots which must appear in a name
          given to
          <a class="permalink" href="#res_query"><code class="Fn" id="res_query">res_query</code></a>()

          absolute query</i></a> will be made. The default for
          <a class="permalink" href="#n"><i class="Em" id="n">n</i></a> is
          &#x201C;1&#x201D;, meaning that if there are any dots in a name, the
          name will be tried first as an absolute name before any
          <i class="Em">search list</i> elements are appended to it.</dd>
      <dt id="timeout~2"><a class="permalink" href="#timeout~2"><b class="Sy">timeout</b></a>:<var class="Ar">n</var></dt>
      <dd>sets the initial amount of time the resolver will wait for a response
          from a remote name server before retrying the query via a different
          name server. The total timeout allowed for a query depends on the
          number of retries and the number of nameservers. This value is ignored
          if a total timeout is specified using the
          <a class="Sx" href="#timeout">timeout</a> keyword (see above). The
          resolver may wait longer during subsequent retries of the current
          query since an exponential back-off is applied to the timeout value.
          Measured in seconds, the default is
          <code class="Dv">RES_TIMEOUT</code>, the allowed maximum is
          <code class="Dv">RES_MAXRETRANS</code> (see

      <dd>sets the number of times the resolver will send a query to each of its

          allowed maximum is <code class="Dv">RES_MAXRETRY</code> (see

      <dt id="no_tld_query"><a class="permalink" href="#no_tld_query"><b class="Sy">no_tld_query</b></a></dt>
      <dd>tells the resolver not to attempt to resolve a top level domain name,

          prevent the resolver from obeying the standard

      <dt id="reload-period"><a class="permalink" href="#reload-period"><b class="Sy">reload-period</b></a>:<var class="Ar">n</var></dt>
      <dd>The resolver checks the modification time of

          seconds. If <span class="Pa">/etc/resolv.conf</span> has changed, it
          is automatically reloaded. The default for <var class="Ar">n</var> is
          two seconds. Setting it to zero disables the file check.</dd>

<h1 class="Sh" id="SEARCH_STRATEGY"><a class="permalink" href="#SEARCH_STRATEGY">SEARCH
  STRATEGY</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">macOS uses a DNS search strategy that supports multiple DNS client
    configurations. Each DNS client has its own set of nameserver addresses and
    its own set of operational parameters. Each client can perform DNS queries
    and searches independent of other clients. Each client has a symbolic name
    which is of the same format as a domain name, e.g. &quot;apple.com&quot;. A
    special meta-client, known as the &quot;Super&quot; DNS client acts as a
    router for DNS queries. The Super client chooses among all available clients
    by finding a best match between the domain name given in a query and the
    names of all known clients.</p>
<p class="Pp">Queries for qualified names are sent using a client configuration
    that best matches the domain name given in the query. For example, if there
    is a client named &quot;apple.com&quot;, a search for
    &quot;www.apple.com&quot; would use the resolver configuration specified for
    that client. The matching algorithm chooses the client with the maximum
    number of matching domain components. For example, if there are clients
    named &quot;a.b.c&quot;, and &quot;b.c&quot;, a search for
    &quot;x.a.b.c&quot; would use the &quot;a.b.c&quot; resolver configuration,
    while a search for &quot;x.y.b.c&quot; would use the &quot;b.c&quot; client.
    If there are no matches, the configuration settings in the default client,
    generally corresponding to the <span class="Pa">/etc/resolv.conf</span> file
    or to the &quot;primary&quot; DNS configuration on the system are used for
    the query.</p>
<p class="Pp">If multiple clients are available for the same domain name, the
    clients ordered according to a
    <a class="Sx" href="#search_order">search_order</a> value (see above).
    Queries are sent to these resolvers in sequence by ascending value of
    search_order.</p>
<p class="Pp">The configuration for a particular client may be read from a file
    having the format described in this man page. These are at present located
    by the system in the <span class="Pa">/etc/resolv.conf</span> file and in
    the files found in the <span class="Pa">/etc/resolver</span> directory.
    However, client configurations are not limited to file storage. The
    implementation of the DNS multi-client search strategy may also locate
    client configuratins in other data sources, such as the System Configuration
    Database. Users of the DNS system should make no assumptions about the
    source of the configuration data.</p>
