The <code class="Nm">resolver</code> is a set of routines in the C library
  <a class="Xr">resolv(3)</a> that provide access to the Internet Domain Name
  System (DNS). A resolver configuration file contains information used to
  specify parameters for a DNS resolver client. The file contains a list of
  keywords with values that provide various types of resolver information.
<p class="Pp">Mac OS X supports a DNS search strategy that may involve multiple
    DNS resolver clients. See the <a class="Sx" href="#SEARCH_STRATEGY">SEARCH
    STRATEGY</a> section below for an overview of multi-client DNS search.</p>
<p class="Pp">Each DNS client is configured using the contents of a single
    configuration file of the format described below, or from a property list
    supplied from some other system configuration database. Note that the
    <span class="Pa">/etc/resolv.conf</span> file, which contains configuration
    for the default (or &quot;primary&quot;) DNS resolver client, is maintained
    automatically by Mac OS X and should not be edited manually. Changes to the
    DNS configuration should be made by using the Network Preferences panel.</p>
<p class="Pp">The different configuration options are given below.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="nameserver"><a class="permalink" href="#nameserver">nameserver</a></h2>
Internet address (in dot notation for IPv4 or in colon notation for IPv6) of a
  name server that the resolver should query. The address may optionally have a
  trailing dot followed by a port number. For example,
  <code class="Li">10.0.0.17.55</code> specifies that the nameserver at
  10.0.0.17 uses port 55.
<p class="Pp">Up to <var class="Va">MAXNS</var> (currently 3) name servers may
    be listed, one per keyword. If there are multiple servers, the resolver
    library queries them in the order listed. The algorithm used is to try a
    name server, and if the query times out, try the next, until out of name
    servers, then repeat trying all the name servers until a maximum number of
    retries are made.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="port"><a class="permalink" href="#port">port</a></h2>
IP port number to be used for this resolver. The default port is 53. The port
  number for an individual nameserver may be specified as part of the nameserver
  address (see <a class="Sx" href="#nameserver">nameserver</a> above) to
  override the default or the port number specified as a value for this keyword.
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="domain"><a class="permalink" href="#domain">domain</a></h2>
Domain name associated with this resolver configuration. This option is normally
  not required by the Mac OS X DNS search system when the resolver configuration
  is read from a file in the <span class="Pa">/etc/resolver</span> directory. In
  that case the file name is used as the domain name. However,
  <a class="Sx" href="#domain">domain</a> must be provided when there are
  multiple resolver clients for the same domain name, since multiple files may
  not exist having the same name. See the
  <a class="Sx" href="#SEARCH_STRATEGY">SEARCH STRATEGY</a> section for more
  details.
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="search"><a class="permalink" href="#search">search</a></h2>
Search list for host-name lookup. This parameter is only used by the
  &quot;Super&quot; DNS resolver, which manages the DNS search strategy amongst
  multiple DNS resolver clients. Unqualified queries will be attempted using
  each component of the search list in turn until a match is found. Note that
  this process may be slow and will generate a lot of network traffic if the
  servers for the listed domains are not local, and that queries will time out
  if no server is available for one of the domains.
<p class="Pp">The search list is currently limited to six domains with a total
    of 256 characters.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="search_order"><a class="permalink" href="#search_order">search_order</a></h2>
Only required for those clients that share a domain name with other clients.
  Queries will be sent to these clients in order by ascending
  <a class="Sx" href="#search_order">search_order</a> value. For example, this
  allows two clients for the &quot;.local&quot; domain, which is used by Apple's
  multicast DNS, but which may also be used at some sites as private DNS domain
  name.
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="sortlist"><a class="permalink" href="#sortlist">sortlist</a></h2>
Sortlist allows addresses returned by gethostbyname to be sorted. A sortlist is
  specified by IP address netmask pairs. The netmask is optional and defaults to
  the natural netmask of the net. The IP address and optional network pairs are
  separated by slashes. Up to 10 pairs may be specified. For example:
<div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent">
<pre>
 sortlist 130.155.160.0/255.255.240.0 130.155.0.0
</pre>
</div>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="timeout"><a class="permalink" href="#timeout">timeout</a></h2>
Specifies the total amount of time allowed for a name resolution. This time
  interval is divided by the number of nameservers and the number of retries
  allowed for each nameserver.
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="options"><a class="permalink" href="#options">options</a></h2>
Options allows certain internal resolver variables to be modified. The syntax
  is:
<p class="Pp">options <var class="Ar">option</var>
  <code class="Li">...</code></p>
<p class="Pp">where <var class="Ar">option</var> is one of the following:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><var class="Ar">debug</var></dt>
  <dd>sets <var class="Va">RES_DEBUG</var> in the resolver options.</dd>
  <dt><var class="Ar">timeout:n</var></dt>
  <dd>sets the per-retry timeout for resolver queries. The total timeout allowed
      for a query depends on the number of retries and the number of
      nameservers. This value is ignored if a total timeout is specified using
      the <a class="Sx" href="#timeout">timeout</a> keyword (see above).</dd>
  <dt><var class="Ar">ndots:n</var></dt>
  <dd>Sets a threshold for the number of dots which must appear in a name given
      to <a class="Sx" href="#res_query">res_query</a> (see
      <a class="Xr">resolver(3))</a> before an initial absolute query will be
      made. The default for <var class="Ar">n</var> is ``1'', meaning that if
      there are any dots in a name, the name will be tried first as an absolute
      name before any <a class="Sx" href="#search">search</a> list elements are
      appended to it.
    <p class="Pp">The keyword and value must appear on a single line, and the
        keyword must start the line. The value follows the keyword, separated by
        white space.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="SEARCH_STRATEGY"><a class="permalink" href="#SEARCH_STRATEGY">SEARCH
  STRATEGY</a></h1>
Mac OS X uses a DNS search strategy that supports multiple DNS client
  configurations. Each DNS client has its own set of nameserver addresses and
  its own set of operational parameters. Each client can perform DNS queries and
  searches independent of other clients. Each client has a symbolic name which
  is of the same format as a domain name, e.g. &quot;apple.com&quot;. A special
  meta-client, known as the &quot;Super&quot; DNS client acts as a router for
  DNS queries. The Super client chooses among all available clients by finding a
  best match between the domain name given in a query and the names of all known
  clients.
<p class="Pp">Queries for qualified names are sent using a client configuration
    that best matches the domain name given in the query. For example, if there
    is a client named &quot;apple.com&quot;, a search for
    &quot;www.apple.com&quot; would use the resolver configuration specified for
    that client. The matching algorithm chooses the client with the maximum
    number of matching domain components. For example, if there are clients
    named &quot;a.b.c&quot;, and &quot;b.c&quot;, a search for
    &quot;x.a.b.c&quot; would use the &quot;a.b.c&quot; resolver configuration,
    while a search for &quot;x.y.b.c&quot; would use the &quot;b.c&quot; client.
    If there are no matches, the configuration settings in the default client,
    generally corresponding to the <span class="Pa">/etc/resolv.conf</span> file
    or to the &quot;primary&quot; DNS configuration on the system are used for
    the query.</p>
<p class="Pp">If multiple clients are available for the same domain name, the
    clients ordered according to a
    <a class="Sx" href="#search_order">search_order</a> value (see above).
    Queries are sent to these resolvers in sequence by ascending value of
    search_order.</p>
<p class="Pp">The configuration for a particular client may be read from a file
    having the format described in this man page. These are at present located
    by the system in the <span class="Pa">/etc/resolv.conf</span> file and in
    the files found in the <span class="Pa">/etc/resolver</span> directory.
    However, client configurations are not limited to file storage. The
    implementation of the DNS multi-client search strategy may also locate
    client configuratins in other data sources, such as the System Configuration
    Database. Users of the DNS system should make no assumptions about the
    source of the configuration data.</p>
