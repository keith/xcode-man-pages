   Set up some character translations and predefined strings.  \*(-- will
   give an unbreakable dash, \*(PI will give pi, \*(L" will give a left
   double quote, and \*(R" will give a right double quote.  \*(C+ will
   give a nicer C++.  Capital omega is used to do unbreakable dashes and
   therefore won't be available.  \*(C` and \*(C' expand to `' in nroff,
   nothing in troff, for use with C<>.

  reference counts and CvOUTSIDE</a></h1>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>CvWEAKOUTSIDE</dt>
  <dd>Each CV has a pointer, <span class="Li">&quot;CvOUTSIDE()&quot;</span>, to
      its lexically enclosing CV (if any). Because pointers to anonymous sub
      prototypes are stored in <span class="Li">&quot;&amp;&quot;</span> pad
      slots, it is a possible to get a circular reference, with the parent
      pointing to the child and vice-versa. To avoid the ensuing memory leak, we
      do not increment the reference count of the CV pointed to by
      <span class="Li">&quot;CvOUTSIDE&quot;</span> in the <i>one specific
      instance</i> that the parent has a
      <span class="Li">&quot;&amp;&quot;</span> pad slot pointing back to us. In
      this case, we set the <span class="Li">&quot;CvWEAKOUTSIDE&quot;</span>
      flag in the child. This allows us to determine under what circumstances we
      should decrement the refcount of the parent when freeing the child.
    <p class="Pp">There is a further complication with non-closure anonymous
        subs (i.e. those that do not refer to any lexicals outside that sub). In
        this case, the anonymous prototype is shared rather than being cloned.
        This has the consequence that the parent may be freed while there are
        still active children, <i>e.g.</i>,</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    BEGIN { $a = sub { eval '$x' } }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">In this case, the BEGIN is freed immediately after execution
        since there are no active references to it: the anon sub prototype has
        <span class="Li">&quot;CvWEAKOUTSIDE&quot;</span> set since it's not a
        closure, and <span class="Li">$a</span> points to the same CV, so it
        doesn't contribute to BEGIN's refcount either. When
        <span class="Li">$a</span> is executed, the <span class="Li">&quot;eval
        '$x'&quot;</span> causes the chain of
        <span class="Li">&quot;CvOUTSIDE&quot;</span>s to be followed, and the
        freed BEGIN is accessed.</p>
    <p class="Pp">To avoid this, whenever a CV and its associated pad is freed,
        any <span class="Li">&quot;&amp;&quot;</span> entries in the pad are
        explicitly removed from the pad, and if the refcount of the pointed-to
        anon sub is still positive, then that child's
        <span class="Li">&quot;CvOUTSIDE&quot;</span> is set to point to its
        grandparent. This will only occur in the single specific case of a
        non-closure anon prototype having one or more active references (such as
        <span class="Li">$a</span> above).</p>
    <p class="Pp">One other thing to consider is that a CV may be merely
        undefined rather than freed, eg <span class="Li">&quot;undef
        &amp;foo&quot;</span>. In this case, its refcount may not have reached
        zero, but we still delete its pad and its
        <span class="Li">&quot;CvROOT&quot;</span> etc. Since various children
        may still have their <span class="Li">&quot;CvOUTSIDE&quot;</span>
        pointing at this undefined CV, we keep its own
        <span class="Li">&quot;CvOUTSIDE&quot;</span> for the time being, so
        that the chain of lexical scopes is unbroken. For example, the following
        should print 123:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    my $x = 123;
    sub tmp { sub { eval '$x' } }
    my $a = tmp();
    undef &amp;tmp;
    print  $a-&gt;();

        <span class="Li">&quot;refcounted_he&quot;</span>. Complex types of
        scalar will not be stored with referential integrity, but will be
        coerced to strings. <span class="Li">&quot;value&quot;</span> may be
        either null or <span class="Li">&amp;PL_sv_placeholder</span> to

    <p class="Pp">If <span class="Li">&quot;block&quot;</span> is null then the
        subroutine will have no body, and for the time being it will be an error
        to call it. This represents a forward subroutine declaration such as
        <span class="Li">&quot;sub&#x00A0;foo&#x00A0;($$);&quot;</span>. If
        <span class="Li">&quot;block&quot;</span> is non-null then it provides
        the Perl code of the subroutine body, which will be executed when the
        subroutine is called. This body includes any argument unwrapping code
        resulting from a subroutine signature or similar. The pad use of the
        code must correspond to the pad attached to
        <span class="Li">&quot;PL_compcv&quot;</span>. The code is not expected
        to include a <span class="Li">&quot;leavesub&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;leavesublv&quot;</span> op; this function will
        add such an op. <span class="Li">&quot;block&quot;</span> is consumed by
        this function and will become part of the constructed subroutine.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;proto&quot;</span> specifies the
        subroutine's prototype, unless one is supplied as an attribute (see
        below). If <span class="Li">&quot;proto&quot;</span> is null, then the
        subroutine will not have a prototype. If
        <span class="Li">&quot;proto&quot;</span> is non-null, it must point to
        a <span class="Li">&quot;const&quot;</span> op whose value is a string,
        and the subroutine will have that string as its prototype. If a
        prototype is supplied as an attribute, the attribute takes precedence
        over <span class="Li">&quot;proto&quot;</span>, but in that case
        <span class="Li">&quot;proto&quot;</span> should preferably be null. In
        any case, <span class="Li">&quot;proto&quot;</span> is consumed by this
        function.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;attrs&quot;</span> supplies attributes
        to be applied the subroutine. A handful of attributes take effect by
        built-in means, being applied to
        <span class="Li">&quot;PL_compcv&quot;</span> immediately when seen.
        Other attributes are collected up and attached to the subroutine by this
        route. <span class="Li">&quot;attrs&quot;</span> may be null to supply
        no attributes, or point to a <span class="Li">&quot;const&quot;</span>
        op for a single attribute, or point to a
        <span class="Li">&quot;list&quot;</span> op whose children apart from
        the <span class="Li">&quot;pushmark&quot;</span> are
        <span class="Li">&quot;const&quot;</span> ops for one or more
        attributes. Each <span class="Li">&quot;const&quot;</span> op must be a
        string, giving the attribute name optionally followed by parenthesised
        arguments, in the manner in which attributes appear in Perl source. The
        attributes will be applied to the sub by this function.
        <span class="Li">&quot;attrs&quot;</span> is consumed by this
      function.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If <span class="Li">&quot;o_is_gv&quot;</span> is false and
        <span class="Li">&quot;o&quot;</span> is null, then the subroutine will
        be anonymous. If <span class="Li">&quot;o_is_gv&quot;</span> is false
        and <span class="Li">&quot;o&quot;</span> is non-null, then
        <span class="Li">&quot;o&quot;</span> must point to a
        <span class="Li">&quot;const&quot;</span> op, which will be consumed by
        this function, and its string value supplies a name for the subroutine.
        The name may be qualified or unqualified, and if it is unqualified then
        a default stash will be selected in some manner. If
        <span class="Li">&quot;o_is_gv&quot;</span> is true, then
        <span class="Li">&quot;o&quot;</span> doesn't point to an
        <span class="Li">&quot;OP&quot;</span> at all, but is instead a cast
        pointer to a <span class="Li">&quot;GV&quot;</span> by which the
        subroutine will be named.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If there is already a subroutine of the specified name, then
        the new sub will either replace the existing one in the glob or be
        merged with the existing one. A warning may be generated about
        redefinition.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If the subroutine has one of a few special names, such as
        <span class="Li">&quot;BEGIN&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;END&quot;</span>, then it will be claimed by the
        appropriate queue for automatic running of phase-related subroutines. In
        this case the relevant glob will be left not containing any subroutine,
        even if it did contain one before. In the case of
        <span class="Li">&quot;BEGIN&quot;</span>, the subroutine will be
        executed and the reference to it disposed of before this function
        returns.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The function returns a pointer to the constructed subroutine.
        If the sub is anonymous then ownership of one counted reference to the
        subroutine is transferred to the caller. If the sub is named then the
        caller does not get ownership of a reference. In most such cases, where
        the sub has a non-phase name, the sub will be alive at the point it is
        returned by virtue of being contained in the glob that names it. A
        phase-named subroutine will usually be alive by virtue of the reference
        owned by the phase's automatic run queue. But a
        <span class="Li">&quot;BEGIN&quot;</span> subroutine, having already
        been executed, will quite likely have been destroyed already by the time
        this function returns, making it erroneous for the caller to make any
        use of the returned pointer. It is the caller's responsibility to ensure
        that it knows which of these situations applies.</p>

  <dt>newXS_len_flags</dt>
  <dd>Construct an XS subroutine, also performing some surrounding jobs.
    <p class="Pp">The subroutine will have the entry point
        <span class="Li">&quot;subaddr&quot;</span>. It will have the prototype
        specified by the nul-terminated string
        <span class="Li">&quot;proto&quot;</span>, or no prototype if
        <span class="Li">&quot;proto&quot;</span> is null. The prototype string
        is copied; the caller can mutate the supplied string afterwards. If
        <span class="Li">&quot;filename&quot;</span> is non-null, it must be a
        nul-terminated filename, and the subroutine will have its
        <span class="Li">&quot;CvFILE&quot;</span> set accordingly. By default
        <span class="Li">&quot;CvFILE&quot;</span> is set to point directly to
        the supplied string, which must be static. If
        <span class="Li">&quot;flags&quot;</span> has the
        <span class="Li">&quot;XS_DYNAMIC_FILENAME&quot;</span> bit set, then a
        copy of the string will be taken instead.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Other aspects of the subroutine will be left in their default
        state. If anything else needs to be done to the subroutine for it to
        function correctly, it is the caller's responsibility to do that after
        this function has constructed it. However, beware of the subroutine
        potentially being destroyed before this function returns, as described
        below.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If <span class="Li">&quot;name&quot;</span> is null then the
        subroutine will be anonymous, with its
        <span class="Li">&quot;CvGV&quot;</span> referring to an
        <span class="Li">&quot;__ANON__&quot;</span> glob. If
        <span class="Li">&quot;name&quot;</span> is non-null then the subroutine
        will be named accordingly, referenced by the appropriate glob.
        <span class="Li">&quot;name&quot;</span> is a string of length
        <span class="Li">&quot;len&quot;</span> bytes giving a sigilless symbol
        name, in UTF-8 if <span class="Li">&quot;flags&quot;</span> has the
        <span class="Li">&quot;SVf_UTF8&quot;</span> bit set and in Latin-1
        otherwise. The name may be either qualified or unqualified, with the
        stash defaulting in the same manner as for
        <span class="Li">&quot;gv_fetchpvn_flags&quot;</span>.
        <span class="Li">&quot;flags&quot;</span> may contain flag bits
        understood by <span class="Li">&quot;gv_fetchpvn_flags&quot;</span> with
        the same meaning as they have there, such as
        <span class="Li">&quot;GV_ADDWARN&quot;</span>. The symbol is always
        added to the stash if necessary, with
        <span class="Li">&quot;GV_ADDMULTI&quot;</span> semantics.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If there is already a subroutine of the specified name, then
        the new sub will replace the existing one in the glob. A warning may be
        generated about the redefinition. If the old subroutine was
        <span class="Li">&quot;CvCONST&quot;</span> then the decision about
        whether to warn is influenced by an expectation about whether the new
        subroutine will become a constant of similar value. That expectation is
        determined by <span class="Li">&quot;const_svp&quot;</span>. (Note that
        the call to this function doesn't make the new subroutine
        <span class="Li">&quot;CvCONST&quot;</span> in any case; that is left to
        the caller.) If <span class="Li">&quot;const_svp&quot;</span> is null
        then it indicates that the new subroutine will not become a constant. If
        <span class="Li">&quot;const_svp&quot;</span> is non-null then it
        indicates that the new subroutine will become a constant, and it points
        to an <span class="Li">&quot;SV*&quot;</span> that provides the constant
        value that the subroutine will have.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If the subroutine has one of a few special names, such as
        <span class="Li">&quot;BEGIN&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;END&quot;</span>, then it will be claimed by the
        appropriate queue for automatic running of phase-related subroutines. In
        this case the relevant glob will be left not containing any subroutine,
        even if it did contain one before. In the case of
        <span class="Li">&quot;BEGIN&quot;</span>, the subroutine will be
        executed and the reference to it disposed of before this function
        returns, and also before its prototype is set. If a
        <span class="Li">&quot;BEGIN&quot;</span> subroutine would not be
        sufficiently constructed by this function to be ready for execution then
        the caller must prevent this happening by giving the subroutine a
        different name.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The function returns a pointer to the constructed subroutine.
        If the sub is anonymous then ownership of one counted reference to the

  Manipulation Functions</a></h1>
An SV (or AV, HV, etc.) is allocated in two parts: the head (struct sv, av,
  hv...) contains type and reference count information, and for many types, a
  pointer to the body (struct xrv, xpv, xpviv...), which contains fields
  specific to each type. Some types store all they need in the head, so don't
  have a body.
<p class="Pp">In all but the most memory-paranoid configurations (ex: PURIFY),
    heads and bodies are allocated out of arenas, which by default are
    approximately 4K chunks of memory parcelled up into N heads or bodies.
    Sv-bodies are allocated by their sv-type, guaranteeing size consistency
    needed to allocate safely from arrays.</p>
<p class="Pp">For SV-heads, the first slot in each arena is reserved, and holds
    a link to the next arena, some flags, and a note of the number of slots.
    Snaked through each arena chain is a linked list of free items; when this
    becomes empty, an extra arena is allocated and divided up into N items which
    are threaded into the free list.</p>
<p class="Pp">SV-bodies are similar, but they use arena-sets by default, which
    separate the link and info from the arena itself, and reclaim the 1st slot
    in the arena. SV-bodies are further described later.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following global variables are associated with arenas:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
 PL_sv_arenaroot     pointer to list of SV arenas
 PL_sv_root          pointer to list of free SV structures

 PL_body_arenas      head of linked-list of body arenas
 PL_body_roots[]     array of pointers to list of free bodies of svtype
                     arrays are indexed by the svtype needed
</pre>
<p class="Pp">A few special SV heads are not allocated from an arena, but are
    instead directly created in the interpreter structure, eg PL_sv_undef. The
    size of arenas can be changed from the default by setting PERL_ARENA_SIZE
    appropriately at compile time.</p>
<p class="Pp">The SV arena serves the secondary purpose of allowing still-live
    SVs to be located and destroyed during final cleanup.</p>
<p class="Pp">At the lowest level, the macros <b>new_SV()</b> and
    <b>del_SV()</b> grab and free an SV head. (If debugging with -DD,
    <b>del_SV()</b> calls the function <b>S_del_sv()</b> to return the SV to the
    free list with error checking.) <b>new_SV()</b> calls <b>more_sv()</b> /
    <b>sv_add_arena()</b> to add an extra arena if the free list is empty. SVs
    in the free list have their SvTYPE field set to all ones.</p>
<p class="Pp">At the time of very final cleanup, <b>sv_free_arenas()</b> is
    called from <b>perl_destruct()</b> to physically free all the arenas
    allocated since the start of the interpreter.</p>
<p class="Pp">The function <b>visit()</b> scans the SV arenas list, and calls a
    specified function for each SV it finds which is still live - ie which has
    an SvTYPE other than all 1's, and a non-zero SvREFCNT. <b>visit()</b> is
    used by the following functions (specified as [function that calls
    <b>visit()</b>] / [function called by <b>visit()</b> for each SV]):</p>
