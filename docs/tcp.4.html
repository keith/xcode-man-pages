<p class="Pp">The TCP protocol provides reliable, flow-controlled, two-way
    transmission of data. It is a byte-stream protocol used to support the
    <code class="Dv">SOCK_STREAM</code> abstraction. TCP uses the standard
    Internet address format and, in addition, provides a per-host collection of
    &#x201C;port addresses&#x201D;. Thus, each address is composed of an
    Internet address specifying the host and network, with a specific TCP port
    on the host identifying the peer entity.</p>
<p class="Pp">Sockets utilizing the TCP protocol are either
    &#x201C;active&#x201D; or &#x201C;passive&#x201D;. Active sockets initiate
    connections to passive sockets. By default, TCP sockets are created active;
    to create a passive socket, the <a class="Xr">listen(2)</a> system call must
    be used after binding the socket with the <a class="Xr">bind(2)</a> system
    call. Only passive sockets may use the <a class="Xr">accept(2)</a> call to
    accept incoming connections. Only active sockets may use the
    <a class="Xr">connect(2)</a> or <a class="Xr">connectx(2)</a> call to
    initiate connections.</p>
<p class="Pp">Passive sockets may &#x201C;underspecify&#x201D; their location to
    match incoming connection requests from multiple networks. This technique,
    termed &#x201C;wildcard addressing&#x201D;, allows a single server to
    provide service to clients on multiple networks. To create a socket which
    listens on all networks, the Internet address
    <code class="Dv">INADDR_ANY</code> must be bound. The TCP port may still be
    specified at this time; if the port is not specified, the system will assign
    one. Once a connection has been established, the socket's address is fixed
    by the peer entity's location. The address assigned to the socket is the
    address associated with the network interface through which packets are
    being transmitted and received. Normally, this address corresponds to the
    peer entity's network.</p>
<p class="Pp">TCP supports a number of socket options which can be set with
    <a class="Xr">setsockopt(2)</a> and tested with
    <a class="Xr">getsockopt(2)</a>:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="TCP_NODELAY"><a class="permalink" href="#TCP_NODELAY"><code class="Dv">TCP_NODELAY</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Under most circumstances, TCP sends data when it is presented; when
      outstanding data has not yet been acknowledged, it gathers small amounts
      of output to be sent in a single packet once an acknowledgement is
      received. For a small number of clients, such as window systems that send
      a stream of mouse events which receive no replies, this packetization may
      cause significant delays. The boolean option
      <code class="Dv">TCP_NODELAY</code> defeats this algorithm.</dd>
  <dt id="TCP_MAXSEG"><a class="permalink" href="#TCP_MAXSEG"><code class="Dv">TCP_MAXSEG</code></a></dt>
  <dd>By default, a sender- and <span class="No">receiver-</span>TCP will
      negotiate among themselves to determine the maximum segment size to be
      used for each connection. The <code class="Dv">TCP_MAXSEG</code> option
      allows the user to determine the result of this negotiation, and to reduce
      it if desired.</dd>
  <dt id="TCP_NOOPT"><a class="permalink" href="#TCP_NOOPT"><code class="Dv">TCP_NOOPT</code></a></dt>
  <dd>TCP usually sends a number of options in each packet, corresponding to
      various TCP extensions which are provided in this implementation. The
      boolean option <code class="Dv">TCP_NOOPT</code> is provided to disable
      TCP option use on a per-connection basis.</dd>
  <dt id="TCP_NOPUSH"><a class="permalink" href="#TCP_NOPUSH"><code class="Dv">TCP_NOPUSH</code></a></dt>
  <dd>By convention, the <span class="No">sender-</span>TCP will set the
      &#x201C;push&#x201D; bit, and begin transmission immediately (if
      permitted) at the end of every user call to <a class="Xr">write(2)</a> or
      <a class="Xr">writev(2)</a>. When this option is set to a non-zero value,
      TCP will delay sending any data at all until either the socket is closed,
      or the internal send buffer is filled.</dd>
  <dt id="TCP_KEEPALIVE"><a class="permalink" href="#TCP_KEEPALIVE"><code class="Dv">TCP_KEEPALIVE</code></a></dt>
  <dd>The <code class="Dv">TCP_KEEPALIVE</code> options enable to specify the
      amount of time, in seconds, that the connection must be idle before
      keepalive probes (if enabled) are sent. The default value is specified by
      the MIB variable <var class="Va">net.inet.tcp.keepidle</var>.</dd>
  <dt id="TCP_CONNECTIONTIMEOUT"><a class="permalink" href="#TCP_CONNECTIONTIMEOUT"><code class="Dv">TCP_CONNECTIONTIMEOUT</code></a></dt>
  <dd>The <code class="Dv">TCP_CONNECTIONTIMEOUT</code> option allows to specify
      the timeout, in seconds, for new, non established TCP connections. This
      option can be useful for both active and passive TCP connections. The
      default value is specified by the MIB variable
      <var class="Va">net.inet.tcp.keepinit</var>.</dd>
  <dt id="TCP_KEEPINTVL"><a class="permalink" href="#TCP_KEEPINTVL"><code class="Dv">TCP_KEEPINTVL</code></a></dt>
  <dd>When keepalive probes are enabled, this option will set the amount of time
      in seconds between successive keepalives sent to probe an unresponsive
      peer.</dd>
  <dt id="TCP_KEEPCNT"><a class="permalink" href="#TCP_KEEPCNT"><code class="Dv">TCP_KEEPCNT</code></a></dt>
  <dd>When keepalive probes are enabled, this option will set the number of
      times a keepalive probe should be repeated if the peer is not responding.
      After this many probes, the connection will be closed.</dd>
  <dt id="TCP_SENDMOREACKS"><a class="permalink" href="#TCP_SENDMOREACKS"><code class="Dv">TCP_SENDMOREACKS</code></a></dt>
  <dd>When a stream of TCP data packets are received, OS X uses an algorithm to
      reduce the number of acknowlegements by generating a TCP acknowlegement
      for 8 data packets instead of acknowledging every other data packet. When
      this socket option is enabled, the connection will always send a TCP
      acknowledgement for every other data packet.</dd>
  <dt id="TCP_ENABLE_ECN"><a class="permalink" href="#TCP_ENABLE_ECN"><code class="Dv">TCP_ENABLE_ECN</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Using Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) on TCP allows bi-directional
      end-to-end notification of congestion without dropping packets.
      Conventionally TCP/IP networks signal congestion by dropping packets. When
      ECN is successfully negotiated, an ECN-aware router may set a mark in the
      IP header instead of dropping a packet in order to signal impending
      congestion. The TCP receiver of the packet echoes congestion indication to
      the TCP sender, which reduces it's transmission rate as if it detected a
      dropped packet. This will avoid unnecessary retransmissions and will
      improve latency by saving the time required for recovering a lost
    packet.</dd>
  <dt id="TCP_NOTSENT_LOWAT"><a class="permalink" href="#TCP_NOTSENT_LOWAT"><code class="Dv">TCP_NOTSENT_LOWAT</code></a></dt>
  <dd>The send socket buffer of a TCP sender has unsent and unacknowledged data.
      This option allows a TCP sender to control the amount of unsent data kept
      in the send socket buffer. The value of the option should be the maximum
      amount of unsent data in bytes. Kevent, poll and select will generate a
      write notification when the unsent data falls below the amount given by
      this option. This will allow an application to generate just-in-time fresh
      updates for real-time communication.</dd>
  <dt id="TCP_FASTOPEN"><a class="permalink" href="#TCP_FASTOPEN"><code class="Dv">TCP_FASTOPEN</code></a></dt>
  <dd>The TCP listener can set this option to use TCP Fast Open feature. After
      setting this option, an <a class="Xr">accept(2)</a> may return a socket
      that is in SYN_RECEIVED state but is readable and writable.</dd>
  <dt id="TCP_CONNECTION_INFO"><a class="permalink" href="#TCP_CONNECTION_INFO"><code class="Dv">TCP_CONNECTION_INFO</code></a></dt>
  <dd>This socket option can be used to obtain TCP connection level statistics.
      The &quot;struct tcp_connection_info&quot; defined in
      &lt;netinet/tcp_var.h&gt; is copied to the user buffer.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The option level for the <a class="Xr">setsockopt(2)</a> call is
    the protocol number for TCP, available from
    <a class="Xr">getprotobyname(3)</a>, or <code class="Dv">IPPROTO_TCP</code>.
    All options are declared in
    <code class="In">&lt;<a class="In">netinet/tcp.h</a>&gt;</code>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Options at the IP transport level may be used with TCP; see
    <a class="Xr">ip(4)</a>. Incoming connection requests that are source-routed
    are noted, and the reverse source route is used in responding.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Non-blocking_connect"><a class="permalink" href="#Non-blocking_connect">Non-blocking
  connect</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">When a TCP socket is set non-blocking, and the connection cannot
    be established immediately, <a class="Xr">connect(2)</a> or
    <a class="Xr">connectx(2)</a> returns with the error
    <code class="Dv">EINPROGRESS</code>, and the connection is established
    asynchronously.</p>
<p class="Pp">When the asynchronous connection completes successfully,
    <a class="Xr">select(2)</a> or <a class="Xr">poll(2)</a> or
    <a class="Xr">kqueue(2)</a> will indicate the file descriptor is ready for
    writing. If the connection encounters an error, the file descriptor is
    marked ready for both reading and writing, and the pending error can be
    retrieved via the socket option <code class="Dv">SO_ERROR</code>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that even if the socket is non-blocking, it is possible for
    the connection to be established immediately. In that case
    <a class="Xr">connect(2)</a> or <a class="Xr">connectx(2)</a> does not
    return with <code class="Dv">EINPROGRESS</code>.</p>
