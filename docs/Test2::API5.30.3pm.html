<b>The internals of this package are subject to change at any time!</b> The
  public methods provided will not change in backwards-incompatible ways (once
  there is a stable release), but the underlying implementation details might.
  <b>Do not break encapsulation here!</b>
<p class="Pp">Currently the implementation is to create a single instance of the
    Test2::API::Instance Object. All class methods defer to the single instance.
    There is no public access to the singleton, and that is intentional. The
    class methods provided by this package provide the only functionality
    publicly exposed.</p>
<p class="Pp">This is done primarily to avoid the problems Test::Builder had by
    exposing its singleton. We do not want anyone to replace this singleton,
    rebless it, or directly muck with its internals. If you need to do something
    and cannot because of the restrictions placed here, then please report it as
    an issue. If possible, we will create a way for you to implement your
    functionality without exposing things that should not be exposed.</p>

<p class="Pp">Normally <span class="Li">&quot;intercept { ... }&quot;</span>
    only intercepts events sent to the main hub (as added by intercept itself).
    Nested hubs, such as those created by subtests, will not be intercepted.
    This is normally what you will still see the nested events by inspecting the
    subtest event. However there are times where you want to verify each event
    as it is sent, in that case use <span class="Li">&quot;intercept_deep { ...

<p class="Pp">This is intended as a shortcut that lets you release your context

<p class="Pp">Using this inside your test tool takes care of a lot of

    are done. It preserves the subroutine call context (array, scalar,
  void).</p>
<p class="Pp">This is the safest way to write a test tool. The only two

<p class="Pp">This will run the provided codeblock with the args in

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>$NAME</dt>
  <dd>The name of the subtest.</dd>
  <dt>\&amp;CODE</dt>
  <dd>The code to run inside the subtest.</dd>
  <dt>$BUFFERED or \%PARAMS</dt>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>'buffered' =&gt; $bool</dt>
  <dd>Toggle buffered status.</dd>
  <dt>'inherit_trace' =&gt; $bool</dt>
  <dd>Normally the subtest hub is pushed and the sub is allowed to generate its
      own root context for the hub. When this setting is turned on a root
      context will be created for the hub that shares the same trace as the
      current context.

        user-specified subs.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>'no_fork' =&gt; $bool</dt>
  <dd>Defaults to off. Normally forking inside a subtest will actually fork the

</dl>
<p class="Pp"><i>BUFFERED VS UNBUFFERED (OR STREAMED)</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Normally all events inside and outside a subtest are sent to the

    depends on the formatter being used.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>Things not effected by this flag</dt>
  <dd>In both cases events are generated and stored in an array. This array is
      eventually used to populate the

      Test2::Event::Subtest event that is generated at the end of the subtest.
      This flag has no effect on this part, it always happens.
    <p class="Pp">At the end of the subtest, the final Test2::Event::Subtest
        event is sent to the formatter.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Things that are effected by this flag</dt>
  <dd>The <span class="Li">&quot;buffered&quot;</span> attribute of the
      Test2::Event::Subtest event will be set to the value of this flag. This
      means any formatter, listener, etc which looks at the event will know if
      it was buffered.</dd>
  <dt>Things that are formatter dependant</dt>
  <dd>Events within a buffered subtest may or may not be sent to the formatter
      as they happen. If a formatter fails to specify then the default is to
      <b>NOT SEND</b> the events as they are generated, instead the formatter
      can pull them from the <span class="Li">&quot;subevents&quot;</span>
      attribute.
    <p class="Pp">A formatter can specify by implementing the
        <span class="Li">&quot;hide_buffered()&quot;</span> method. If this
        method returns true then events generated inside a buffered subtest will
        not be sent independently of the final subtest event.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">An example of how this is used is the Test2::Formatter::TAP
    formatter. For unbuffered subtests the events are rendered as they are
    generated. At the end of the subtest, the final subtest event is rendered,
    but the <span class="Li">&quot;subevents&quot;</span> attribute is ignored.
    For buffered subtests the opposite occurs, the events are NOT rendered as
    they are generated, instead the
    <span class="Li">&quot;subevents&quot;</span> attribute is used to render
    them all at once. This is useful when running subtests tests in parallel,
    since without it the output from subtests would be interleaved together.</p>

  <dd>This will return true if the stack and IPC instances have already been

  <dt>$bool = <b>test2_load_done()</b></dt>
  <dd>This will simply return the boolean value of the loaded flag. If Test2 has

      will set it to the first argument's value.
    <p class="Pp">This is used to prevent the use of

  <dd>These functions return the filehandles that test output should be written
      to. They are primarily useful when writing a custom formatter and code
      that turns events into actual output (TAP, etc.). They will return a dupe
      of the original filehandles that formatted output can be sent to
      regardless of whatever state the currently running test may have left

      and STDERR. You shouldn't need to do this except in very peculiar

  HOOKS</a></h2>
These are hooks that allow you to add custom behavior to actions taken by Test2
  and tools built on top of it.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>test2_add_callback_exit(sub { ... })</dt>
  <dd>This can be used to add a callback that is called after all testing is
      done. This is too late to add additional results, the main use of this
      callback is to set the exit code.
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>

        instance of Test2::API::Context. The <span class="Li">$exit</span>
        argument will be the original exit code before anything modified it.
        <span class="Li">$$new_exit</span> is a reference to the new exit code.
        You may modify this to change the exit code. Please note that
        <span class="Li">$$new_exit</span> may already be different from
        <span class="Li">$exit</span></p>
  </dd>
  <dt>test2_add_callback_post_load(sub { ... })</dt>
  <dd>Add a callback that will be called when Test2 is finished loading. This
      means the callback will be run once, the first time a context is obtained.
      If Test2 has already finished loading then the callback will be run
      immediately.</dd>
  <dt>test2_add_callback_testing_done(sub { ... })</dt>
  <dd>This adds your coderef as a follow-up to the root hub after Test2 is
      finished loading.

    });
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>test2_add_callback_context_acquire(sub { ... })</dt>
  <dd>Add a callback that will be called every time someone tries to acquire a
      context. This will be called on EVERY call to
      <span class="Li">&quot;context()&quot;</span>. It gets a single argument,
      a reference to the hash of parameters being used the construct the
      context. This is your chance to change the parameters by directly altering
      the hash.
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>

    test2_add_callback_context_acquire(sub {
        my $params = shift;
        $params-&gt;{level}++;
    });
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This is a very scary API function. Please do not use this
        unless you need to. This is here for Test::Builder and backwards
        compatibility. This has you directly manipulate the hash instead of
        returning a new one for performance reasons.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>test2_add_callback_context_init(sub { ... })</dt>
  <dd>Add a callback that will be called every time a new context is created.

    argument.</dd>
  <dt>test2_add_callback_context_release(sub { ... })</dt>

  <dt>$sub = <b>test2_add_uuid_via()</b></dt>
  <dd>This allows you to provide a UUID generator. If provided UUIDs will be

    <p class="Pp">The sub you provide should always return a unique identifier.

        Test2::API enforces this.</p>

        being tagged 'context', 'hub', or 'event'. In the future additional
