Queues are the fundamental mechanism for scheduling blocks for execution within
  the <a class="Xr">dispatch(3)</a> framework.
<p class="Pp">All blocks submitted to dispatch queues are dequeued in FIFO
    order. Queues created with the <code class="Dv">DISPATCH_QUEUE_SERIAL</code>
    attribute wait for the previously dequeued block to complete before
    dequeuing the next block. A queue with this FIFO completion behavior is
    usually simply described as a &quot;serial queue.&quot; All memory writes
    performed by a block dispatched to a serial queue are guaranteed to be
    visible to subsequent blocks dispatched to the same queue. Queues are not
    bound to any specific thread of execution and blocks submitted to
    independent queues may execute concurrently.</p>
<p class="Pp">Queues created with the
    <code class="Dv">DISPATCH_QUEUE_CONCURRENT</code> attribute may execute
    dequeued blocks concurrently and support barrier blocks submitted with the
    dispatch barrier API.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="CREATION"><a class="permalink" href="#CREATION">CREATION</a></h1>
Queues are created with the <code class="Fn">dispatch_queue_create</code>()
  function. Queues, like all dispatch objects, are reference counted and newly
  created queues have a reference count of one.
<p class="Pp">The optional <var class="Fa">label</var> argument is used to
    describe the purpose of the queue and is useful during debugging and
    performance analysis. If a label is provided, it is copied. By convention,
    clients should pass a reverse DNS style label. For example:</p>
<div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent">
<pre>
my_queue = dispatch_queue_create(&quot;com.example.subsystem.taskXYZ&quot;,
				 DISPATCH_QUEUE_SERIAL);
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The <var class="Fa">attr</var> argument specifies the type of
    queue to create and must be either
    <code class="Dv">DISPATCH_QUEUE_SERIAL</code> or
    <code class="Dv">DISPATCH_QUEUE_CONCURRENT</code>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <code class="Fn">dispatch_queue_get_label</code>() function
    returns the label provided when the given <var class="Fa">queue</var> was
    created (or an empty C string if no label was provided at creation). Passing
    the constant <code class="Dv">DISPATCH_CURRENT_QUEUE_LABEL</code> to
    <code class="Fn">dispatch_queue_get_label</code>() returns the label of the
    current queue.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="SUSPENSION"><a class="permalink" href="#SUSPENSION">SUSPENSION</a></h1>
Queues may be temporarily suspended and resumed with the functions
  <code class="Fn">dispatch_suspend</code>() and
  <code class="Fn">dispatch_resume</code>() respectively. Suspension is checked
  prior to block execution and is <i class="Em">not</i> preemptive.

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="MAIN_QUEUE"><a class="permalink" href="#MAIN_QUEUE">MAIN
  QUEUE</a></h1>
The dispatch framework provides a default serial queue for the application to
  use. This queue is accessed via the
  <code class="Fn">dispatch_get_main_queue</code>() function.
<p class="Pp">Programs must call <code class="Fn">dispatch_main</code>() at the
    end of <code class="Fn">main</code>() in order to process blocks submitted
    to the main queue. (See the
    <a class="Sx" href="#COMPATIBILITY">COMPATIBILITY</a> section for
    exceptions.) The <code class="Fn">dispatch_main</code>() function never
    returns.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="GLOBAL_CONCURRENT_QUEUES"><a class="permalink" href="#GLOBAL_CONCURRENT_QUEUES">GLOBAL
  CONCURRENT QUEUES</a></h1>
Unlike the main queue or queues allocated with
  <code class="Fn">dispatch_queue_create</code>(), the global concurrent queues
  schedule blocks as soon as threads become available (non-FIFO completion
  order). Four global concurrent queues are provided, representing the following
  priority bands:
<ul class="Bl-bullet Bd-indent Bl-compact">
  <li>DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_HIGH</li>
  <li>DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_DEFAULT</li>
  <li>DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_LOW</li>
  <li>DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_BACKGROUND</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">The priority of a global concurrent queue controls the scheduling
    priority of the threads created by the system to invoke the blocks submitted
    to that queue. Global queues with lower priority will be scheduled for
    execution after all global queues with higher priority have been scheduled.
    Additionally, items on the background priority global queue will execute on
    threads with background state as described in
    <a class="Xr">setpriority(2)</a> (i.e. disk I/O is throttled and the
    thread's scheduling priority is set to lowest value).</p>
<p class="Pp">Use the <code class="Fn">dispatch_get_global_queue</code>()
    function to obtain the global queue of given priority. The
    <var class="Fa">flags</var> argument is reserved for future use and must be
    zero. Passing any value other than zero may result in a NULL return
  value.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="TARGET_QUEUE"><a class="permalink" href="#TARGET_QUEUE">TARGET
  QUEUE</a></h1>
The <code class="Fn">dispatch_set_target_queue</code>() function updates the
  target queue of the given dispatch object. The target queue of an object is
  responsible for processing the object.
<p class="Pp">The new target queue is retained by the given object before the
    previous target queue is released. The new target queue setting will take
    effect between block executions on the object, but not in the middle of any
    existing block executions (non-preemptive).</p>
<p class="Pp">The default target queue of all dispatch objects created by the
    application is the default priority global concurrent queue. To reset an
    object's target queue to the default, pass the
    <code class="Dv">DISPATCH_TARGET_QUEUE_DEFAULT</code> constant to
    <code class="Fn">dispatch_set_target_queue</code>().</p>
<p class="Pp">The priority of a dispatch queue is inherited from its target
    queue. In order to change the priority of a queue created with
    <code class="Fn">dispatch_queue_create</code>(), use the
    <code class="Fn">dispatch_get_global_queue</code>() function to obtain a
    target queue of the desired priority.</p>
<p class="Pp">Blocks submitted to a serial queue whose target queue is another
    serial queue will not be invoked concurrently with blocks submitted to the
    target queue or to any other queue with that same target queue.</p>
<p class="Pp">The target queue of a dispatch source specifies where its event
    handler and cancellation handler blocks will be submitted. See
    <a class="Xr">dispatch_source_create(3)</a> for more information about
    dispatch sources.</p>
<p class="Pp">The target queue of a dispatch I/O channel specifies the priority
    of the global queue where its I/O operations are executed. See
    <a class="Xr">dispatch_io_create(3)</a> for more information about dispatch
    I/O channels.</p>
<p class="Pp">For all other dispatch object types, the only function of the
    target queue is to determine where an object's finalizer function is
    invoked.</p>
<p class="Pp">The result of passing the main queue or a global concurrent queue
    as the first argument of <code class="Fn">dispatch_set_target_queue</code>()
    is undefined.</p>
<p class="Pp">Directly or indirectly setting the target queue of a dispatch
    queue to itself is undefined.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="DEPRECATED_FUNCTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#DEPRECATED_FUNCTIONS">DEPRECATED
  FUNCTIONS</a></h1>
The following functions are deprecated and will be removed in a future release:
<ul class="Bl-item">
  <li><var class="Ft">dispatch_queue_t</var>
      <code class="Fn">dispatch_get_current_queue</code>(<var class="Fa">void</var>);</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp"><code class="Fn">dispatch_get_current_queue</code>() always
    returns a valid queue. When called from within a block submitted to a
    dispatch queue, that queue will be returned. If this function is called from
    the main thread before <code class="Fn">dispatch_main</code>() is called,
    then the result of <code class="Fn">dispatch_get_main_queue</code>() is
    returned. In all other cases, the default target queue will be returned.</p>
<p class="Pp">The use of <code class="Fn">dispatch_get_current_queue</code>() is
    strongly discouraged except for debugging and logging purposes. Code must
    not make any assumptions about the queue returned, unless it is one of the
    global queues or a queue the code has itself created. The returned queue may
    have arbitrary policies that may surprise code that tries to schedule work
    with the queue. The list of policies includes, but is not limited to, queue
    width (i.e. serial vs. concurrent), scheduling priority, security credential
    or filesystem configuration. This function is deprecated and will be removed
    in a future release.</p>
<p class="Pp">It is equally unsafe for code to assume that synchronous execution
    onto a queue is safe from deadlock if that queue is not the one returned by
    <code class="Fn">dispatch_get_current_queue</code>().</p>
<p class="Pp">The result of <code class="Fn">dispatch_get_main_queue</code>()
    may or may not equal the result of
    <code class="Fn">dispatch_get_current_queue</code>() when called on the main
    thread. Comparing the two is not a valid way to test whether code is
    executing on the main thread. Foundation/AppKit programs should use
    [NSThread isMainThread]. POSIX programs may use
    <a class="Xr">pthread_main_np(3)</a>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><code class="Fn">dispatch_get_current_queue</code>() may return a
    queue owned by a different subsystem which has already had all external
    references to it released. While such a queue will continue to exist until
    all blocks submitted to it have completed, attempting to retain it is
    forbidden and will trigger an assertion. If Objective-C Automatic Reference
    Counting is enabled, any use of the object returned by
    <code class="Fn">dispatch_get_current_queue</code>() will cause retain calls
    to be automatically generated, so the use of
    <code class="Fn">dispatch_get_current_queue</code>() for any reason in code
    built with ARC is particularly strongly discouraged.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="COMPATIBILITY"><a class="permalink" href="#COMPATIBILITY">COMPATIBILITY</a></h1>
Cocoa applications need not call <code class="Fn">dispatch_main</code>(). Blocks
  submitted to the main queue will be executed as part of the &quot;common
  modes&quot; of the application's main NSRunLoop or CFRunLoop. However, blocks
  submitted to the main queue in applications using
  <code class="Fn">dispatch_main</code>() are not guaranteed to execute on the
  main thread.
<p class="Pp">The dispatch framework is a pure C level API. As a result, it does
    not catch exceptions generated by higher level languages such as Objective-C
    or C++. Applications <i class="Em">MUST</i> catch all exceptions before
    returning from a block submitted to a dispatch queue; otherwise the process
    will be terminated with an uncaught exception.</p>
<p class="Pp">The dispatch framework manages the relationship between dispatch
    queues and threads of execution. As a result, applications
    <i class="Em">MUST NOT</i> delete or mutate objects that they did not
    create. The following interfaces <i class="Em">MUST NOT</i> be called by
    blocks submitted to a dispatch queue:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet Bd-indent">
  <li><code class="Fn">pthread_cancel</code>()</li>
  <li><code class="Fn">pthread_detach</code>()</li>
  <li><code class="Fn">pthread_join</code>()</li>
  <li><code class="Fn">pthread_kill</code>()</li>
  <li><code class="Fn">pthread_exit</code>()</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">Applications <i class="Em">MAY</i> call the following interfaces
    from a block submitted to a dispatch queue if and only if they restore the
    thread to its original state before returning:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet Bd-indent">
  <li><code class="Fn">pthread_setcancelstate</code>()</li>
  <li><code class="Fn">pthread_setcanceltype</code>()</li>
  <li><code class="Fn">pthread_setschedparam</code>()</li>
  <li><code class="Fn">pthread_sigmask</code>()</li>
  <li><code class="Fn">pthread_setugid_np</code>()</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">Applications <i class="Em">MUST NOT</i> rely on the following
    interfaces returning predictable results between invocations of blocks
    submitted to a dispatch queue:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet Bd-indent">
  <li><code class="Fn">pthread_self</code>()</li>
  <li><code class="Fn">pthread_getschedparam</code>()</li>
  <li><code class="Fn">pthread_get_stacksize_np</code>()</li>
  <li><code class="Fn">pthread_get_stackaddr_np</code>()</li>
  <li><code class="Fn">pthread_mach_thread_np</code>()</li>
  <li><code class="Fn">pthread_from_mach_thread_np</code>()</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">While the result of <code class="Fn">pthread_self</code>() may
    change between invocations of blocks, the value will not change during the
    execution of any single block. Because the underlying thread may change
    beteween block invocations on a single queue, using per-thread data as an
    out-of-band return value is error prone. In other words, the result of
    calling <code class="Fn">pthread_setspecific</code>() and
    <code class="Fn">pthread_getspecific</code>() is well defined within a
    signle block, but not across multiple blocks. Also, one cannot make any
    assumptions about when the destructor passed to
    <code class="Fn">pthread_key_create</code>() is called. The destructor may
    be called between the invocation of blocks on the same queue, or during the
    idle state of a process.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following example code correctly handles per-thread return
    values:</p>
<div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent">
<pre>
__block int r;
__block int e;
dispatch_sync(queue, ^{
	r = kill(1, 0);
	// Copy the per-thread return value to the callee thread
	e = errno;
});
printf(&quot;kill(1,0) returned %d and errno %d0, r, e);
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Note that in the above example <var class="Va">errno</var> is a
    per-thread variable and must be copied out explicitly as the block may be
    invoked on different thread of execution than the caller. Another example of
    per-thread data that would need to be copied is the use of
    <code class="Fn">getpwnam</code>() instead of
    <code class="Fn">getpwnam_r</code>().</p>
<p class="Pp">As an optimization, <code class="Fn">dispatch_sync</code>()
    invokes the block on the current thread when possible. In this case, the
    thread specific data such as <var class="Va">errno</var> may persist from
    the block until back to the caller. Great care should be taken not to
    accidentally rely on this side-effect.</p>
