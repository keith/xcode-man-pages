    &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/15015&gt;</li>
  <li>In some cases, failing to parse a here-doc would attempt to use freed

  <li>If a here-doc was found while parsing another operator, the parser had

      happening in some cases, e.g. in List::Util.</li>
  <li>Excessive memory usage in the compilation of some regular expressions
