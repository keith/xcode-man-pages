<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
The Accelerate framework (/System/Library/Frameworks/Accelerate.framework)
  contains thousands of hand tuned high performance library routines for common
  problems in signal and image processing and general and scientific computing.
  These routines are provided to help developers and Apple frameworks alike make
  better use of onboard hardware SIMD vector engines (such as SSE and Neon) and
  multiple processors for best performance, without the need to invest in the
  complexity that SIMD and multithreaded programming sometimes requires.
<p class="Pp">A typical Accelerate.framework function will be presented as a
    single function that accomplishes a task -- e.g. do a discrete Fourier
    transform, or blur an image, or perhaps just multiply two arrays of floats
    together. Once called, a typical Accelerate.framework function will examine
    available hardware and select a tuned version of the algorithm for best
    performance on that hardware for that problem size, image shape, etc. That
    function will usually be hand-tuned vectorized code (i.e. uses SSE or Neon).
    For large enough problems, the function may automatically split up the work
    across multiple processors using Grand Central Dispatch (GCD) or pthreads,
    all without involvement of the caller. The speedups so obtained can be quite
    significant due to impressive synergies between SIMD vector engines and
    multithreading. Vectorization typically will enchance performance many fold
    -- 2, 4, or even 10 fold improvement is normal. Multithreading can then
    further accelerate your code many fold according to the number of processors
    on your system. Some vectorized, multithreaded Accelerate.framework
    functions run hundreds of times faster than their scalar, single threaded
    counterparts!</p>
<p class="Pp">Accelerate.framework is intended to help you towards greater
    application performance regardless of your current investment in high
    performance technologies. If you have already written your own threading
    engine, you can use methods such as the kvImageDoNotTile flag or the
    VECLIB_MAXIMUM_THREADS environment variable to disable internal
    multithreading so that it does not contend with your threading engine (note:
    the value of VECLIB_MAXIMUM_THREADS may be cached by the library and reused;
    if you need to ensure single-threaded execution, you should set
    VECLIB_MAXIMUM_THREADS before making any Accelerate calls). If you have
    pseudo-real-time scheduling needs, Accelerate.framework functions that
    otherwise might allocate their own temporary memory on the heap allow you to
    pass in preallocated temporary buffers, so as to avoid potential locking in
    malloc. If you are interested in writing your own vector code, perhaps to
    speed up areas of your application which is not covered by Accelerate
    functionality, the framework headers provide cross platform vector types
    that you can use to enhance the portability of some vector code and
    facilitate debugging, as well as a number of basic library routines to make
    writing vector code easier, such as the interfaces found in vMathLib, a
    library of math routines (e.g. sin, cos, pow, etc.) for SIMD vectors.</p>
<p class="Pp">To use Accelerate.framework headers:
  <br/>
  #include &lt;Accelerate/Accelerate.h&gt;</p>
<p class="Pp">To link to Accelerate.framework, simply add -framework Accelerate
    to your compiler line:
  <br/>
  cc -framework Accelerate my_file.c</p>

  Umbrella Framework</a></h1>
The Accelerate umbrella framework encompasses all the libraries provided with
  MacOS X that Apple has optimized for high performance vector and numerical
  computing. Subsequent sections describe the sub-frameworks that comprise the
  Accelerate framework.
<p class="Pp">Please link to Accelerate.framework. The positioning of interfaces
    within sub-frameworks and libraries within Accelerate.framework is subject
    to change.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="vImage_Framework"><a class="permalink" href="#vImage_Framework">vImage
  Framework</a></h1>
This framework is designed to provide a suite of image processing primitives.
  Convolutions, Morphological operators, and Geometric transforms (e.g. scale,
  shear, warp, rotate) are provided. Alpha compositing and histogram operations
  are also supported, in addition to various conversion routines between
  different image formats. vImage uses your image data in place without costly
  packing and unpacking from wrapper objects, using a simple descriptor of the
  image using base address, height, width and row bytes (to allow for tiling and
  row padding). Four core formats are supported:
<p class="Pp">Planar8 - a single channel, 8-bit per channel image
  <br/>
  ARGB8888 - a four channel, 8-bit per channel image.*
  <br/>
  PlanarF - a single channel, floating point image.
  <br/>
  ARGBFFFF - a four channel, floating point image.*</p>
<p class="Pp">*Most functions are channel order agnostic, but where it matters,
    RGBA and BGRA forms may also be provided.</p>
<p class="Pp">Other formats are supported by conversion to core format prior to
    applying various vImage functions. The conversion cost is typically very
    small, and is in many cases faster than attempting to do the conversion just
    in time within the function, because many redundant conversions to a
    arithmetic format usable by the core vector units, some hidden from you, can
    be avoided. The formats provided reflect core performance competencies of
    the vector hardware rather than the wide diversity of image formats out
    there.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="vecLib_Framework"><a class="permalink" href="#vecLib_Framework">vecLib
  Framework</a></h1>
The vecLib framework is a collection of facilities covering digital signal
  processing (vDSP), matrix computations (BLAS), numerical linear algebra
  (LAPACK) and mathematical routines (vForce/vMathLib)
<p class="Pp">The vDSP, BLAS and LAPACK components of vecLib run on the scalar
    and vector domain. vecLib automatically detects the presence of the vector
    engine and uses it. vMathLib mirrors the existing scalar libm on the vector
    engine. vMathLib runs only on the vector engine.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="vDSP"><a class="permalink" href="#vDSP">vDSP</a></h1>
The vDSP Library provides mathematical functions for applications such as
  speech, sound, audio, and video processing, diagnostic medical imaging, radar
  signal processing, seismic analysis, and scientific data processing.
<p class="Pp">The vDSP functions operate on real and complex data types. The
    functions include data type conversions, fast Fourier transforms (FFTs), and
    vector-to-vector and vector-to-scalar operations.</p>
<p class="Pp">The vDSP functions have been implemented in two ways: as
    vectorized code, using the vector unit on the ARM and Intel microprocessors,
    and as scalar code, which runs on all machines. Vector code often has
    special alignment restrictions. If your data is not properly aligned it is
    common for vDSP to use the scalar path as a fallback. For best results on
    Intel, align your data to a multiple of 16 bytes. (Malloc naturally aligns
    memory blocks that it allocates to 16 bytes on MacOS X.)</p>
<p class="Pp">It is noteworthy that vDSP's FFTs are one of the fastest
    implementations of the Discrete Fourier Transforms available anywhere.</p>
<p class="Pp">The vDSP Library itself is included as part of vecLib in Mac OS X.
    The header file, vDSP.h, defines data types used by the vDSP functions and
    symbols accepted as flag arguments to vDSP functions.</p>
<p class="Pp">vDSP functions are available in single and double precision. Note
    that only the single precision is vectorized on ARM due to the underlying
    instruction set architecture of the vector engine on board. The Intel vector
    unit supports both single and double precision, so double precision
    operations can be vectorized on Intel processors.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="BLAS"><a class="permalink" href="#BLAS">BLAS</a></h1>
The Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines (BLAS) are high quality, industry standard
  routines for performing basic vector and matrix operations. Level 1 BLAS
  consists of vector-vector operations, Level 2 BLAS consists of matrix-vector
  operations, and Level 3 BLAS have matrix-matrix operations. The efficiency,
  portability, and the wide adoption of the BLAS have made them commonplace in
  the development of high quality linear algebra software such as LAPACK and in
  other technologies requiring fast vector and matrix calculations. All of the
  industry standard FORTRAN and C BLAS entry points, as well as some common
  extensions, are exported by the vecLib framework.
<p class="Pp">For more information refer to:</p>
<p class="Pp">&lt;http://www.netlib.org/blas/faq.html&gt;</p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="LAPACK"><a class="permalink" href="#LAPACK">LAPACK</a></h1>
LAPACK provides routines for solving systems of simultaneous linear equations,
  least-squares solutions of linear systems of equations, eigenvalue problems,
  and singular value problems. The associated matrix factorizations (LU,
  Cholesky, QR, SVD, Schur, generalized Schur) are also provided, as are related
  computations such as reordering of the Schur factorizations and estimating
  condition numbers. Dense and banded matrices are handled, but not general
  sparse matrices. In all areas, similar functionality is provided for real and
  complex matrices, in both single and double precision. LAPACK in vecLib makes
  full use of the optimized BLAS and fully benefits from their performance. All
  the industry standard FORTRAN LAPACK entry points are exported from the vecLib
  framework. C programs may make calls to the FORTRAN entry points using the
  prototypes set out in
  &quot;/System/Library/Frameworks/vecLib.framework/Headers/clapack.h&quot;.
<p class="Pp">For more information, please see:</p>
<p class="Pp">&lt;http://www.netlib.org/lapack/index.html&gt;</p>
<p class="Pp">LAPACK follows FORTRAN calling conventions (even when called from
    C code). Users must be aware that ALL arguments are passed by reference.
    This includes all scalar arguments such as matrix dimensions and scale
    factors. Additionally, please note that two-dimensional arrays such as
    matrices are stored in column-major order; this differs from how C
    programmers customarily lay out such arrays.</p>

Accelerate.framework is not magic! It will not vectorize or multithread your
  code for you, just because you linked against the framework. You have to
  actually call the functions exported by the Accelerate.framework, and then
  only those functions from the framework that you called will be Accelerated.
