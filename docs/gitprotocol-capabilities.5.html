<div class="Bd-indent">
<br/>
<b>Note</b>
<p class="Pp">this document describes capabilities for versions 0 and 1 of the
    pack protocol. For version 2, please refer to the <b>gitprotocol-v2</b>(5)
    doc.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Servers SHOULD support all capabilities defined in this
  document.</p>
<p class="Pp">On the very first line of the initial server response of either
    receive-pack and upload-pack the first reference is followed by a NUL byte
    and then a list of space delimited server capabilities. These allow the
    server to declare what it can and cannot support to the client.</p>
<p class="Pp">Client will then send a space separated list of capabilities it
    wants to be in effect. The client MUST NOT ask for capabilities the server
    did not say it supports.</p>
<p class="Pp">Server MUST diagnose and abort if capabilities it does not
    understand was sent. Server MUST NOT ignore capabilities that client
    requested and server advertised. As a consequence of these rules, server
    MUST NOT advertise capabilities it does not understand.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>atomic</i>, <i>report-status</i>, <i>report-status-v2</i>,
    <i>delete-refs</i>, <i>quiet</i>, and <i>push-cert</i> capabilities are sent
    and recognized by the receive-pack (push to server) process.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>ofs-delta</i> and <i>side-band-64k</i> capabilities are
    sent and recognized by both upload-pack and receive-pack protocols. The
    <i>agent</i> and <i>session-id</i> capabilities may optionally be sent in
    both protocols.</p>
<p class="Pp">All other capabilities are only recognized by the upload-pack
    (fetch from server) process.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="MULTI_ACK"><a class="permalink" href="#MULTI_ACK">MULTI_ACK</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The <i>multi_ack</i> capability allows the server to return
    &quot;ACK obj-id continue&quot; as soon as it finds a commit that it can use
    as a common base, between the client&#x2019;s wants and the client&#x2019;s
    have set.</p>
<p class="Pp">By sending this early, the server can potentially head off the
    client from walking any further down that particular branch of the
    client&#x2019;s repository history. The client may still need to walk down
    other branches, sending have lines for those, until the server has a
    complete cut across the DAG, or the client has said &quot;done&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">Without multi_ack, a client sends have lines in --date-order until
    the server has found a common base. That means the client will send have
    lines that are already known by the server to be common, because they
    overlap in time with another branch that the server hasn&#x2019;t found a
    common base on yet.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example suppose the client has commits in caps that the server
    doesn&#x2019;t and the server has commits in lower case that the client
    doesn&#x2019;t, as in the following diagram:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<br/>
   +---- u ---------------------- x
<br/>
  /              +----- y
<br/>
 /              /
a -- b -- c -- d -- E -- F
<br/>
   \
<br/>
    +--- Q -- R -- S</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">If the client wants x,y and starts out by saying have F,S, the
    server doesn&#x2019;t know what F,S is. Eventually the client says
    &quot;have d&quot; and the server sends &quot;ACK d continue&quot; to let
    the client know to stop walking down that line (so don&#x2019;t send c-b-a),
    but it&#x2019;s not done yet, it needs a base for x. The client keeps going
    with S-R-Q, until a gets reached, at which point the server has a clear base
    and it all ends.</p>
<p class="Pp">Without multi_ack the client would have sent that c-b-a chain
    anyway, interleaved with S-R-Q.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="MULTI_ACK_DETAILED"><a class="permalink" href="#MULTI_ACK_DETAILED">MULTI_ACK_DETAILED</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">This is an extension of multi_ack that permits client to better
    understand the server&#x2019;s in-memory state. See
    <b>gitprotocol-pack</b>(5), section &quot;Packfile Negotiation&quot; for
    more information.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="NO"><a class="permalink" href="#NO">NO-DONE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">This capability should only be used with the smart HTTP protocol.
    If multi_ack_detailed and no-done are both present, then the sender is free
    to immediately send a pack following its first &quot;ACK obj-id ready&quot;
    message.</p>
<p class="Pp">Without no-done in the smart HTTP protocol, the server session
    would end and the client has to make another trip to send &quot;done&quot;
    before the server can send the pack. no-done removes the last round and thus
    slightly reduces latency.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="THIN"><a class="permalink" href="#THIN">THIN-PACK</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">A thin pack is one with deltas which reference base objects not
    contained within the pack (but are known to exist at the receiving end).
    This can reduce the network traffic significantly, but it requires the
    receiving end to know how to &quot;thicken&quot; these packs by adding the
    missing bases to the pack.</p>
<p class="Pp">The upload-pack server advertises <i>thin-pack</i> when it can
    generate and send a thin pack. A client requests the <i>thin-pack</i>
    capability when it understands how to &quot;thicken&quot; it, notifying the
    server that it can receive such a pack. A client MUST NOT request the
    <i>thin-pack</i> capability if it cannot turn a thin pack into a
    self-contained pack.</p>
<p class="Pp">Receive-pack, on the other hand, is assumed by default to be able
    to handle thin packs, but can ask the client not to use the feature by
    advertising the <i>no-thin</i> capability. A client MUST NOT send a thin
    pack if the server advertises the <i>no-thin</i> capability.</p>
<p class="Pp">The reasons for this asymmetry are historical. The receive-pack
    program did not exist until after the invention of thin packs, so
    historically the reference implementation of receive-pack always understood
    thin packs. Adding <i>no-thin</i> later allowed receive-pack to disable the
    feature in a backwards-compatible manner.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="SIDE"><a class="permalink" href="#SIDE">SIDE-BAND,
  SIDE-BAND-64K</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">This capability means that server can send, and client understand
    multiplexed progress reports and error info interleaved with the packfile
    itself.</p>
<p class="Pp">These two options are mutually exclusive. A modern client always
    favors <i>side-band-64k</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Either mode indicates that the packfile data will be streamed
    broken up into packets of up to either 1000 bytes in the case of
    <i>side_band</i>, or 65520 bytes in the case of <i>side_band_64k</i>. Each
    packet is made up of a leading 4-byte pkt-line length of how much data is in
    the packet, followed by a 1-byte stream code, followed by the actual
  data.</p>
<p class="Pp">The stream code can be one of:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>1 - pack data
2 - progress messages
3 - fatal error message just before stream aborts</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The &quot;side-band-64k&quot; capability came about as a way for
    newer clients that can handle much larger packets to request packets that
    are actually crammed nearly full, while maintaining backward compatibility
    for the older clients.</p>
<p class="Pp">Further, with side-band and its up to 1000-byte messages,
    it&#x2019;s actually 999 bytes of payload and 1 byte for the stream code.
    With side-band-64k, same deal, you have up to 65519 bytes of data and 1 byte
    for the stream code.</p>
<p class="Pp">The client MUST send only maximum of one of &quot;side-band&quot;
    and &quot;side- band-64k&quot;. Server MUST diagnose it as an error if
    client requests both.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="OFS"><a class="permalink" href="#OFS">OFS-DELTA</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Server can send, and client understand PACKv2 with delta referring
    to its base by position in pack rather than by an obj-id. That is, they can
    send/read OBJ_OFS_DELTA (aka type 6) in a packfile.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="AGENT"><a class="permalink" href="#AGENT">AGENT</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The server may optionally send a capability of the form
    <b>agent=X</b> to notify the client that the server is running version
    <b>X</b>. The client may optionally return its own agent string by
    responding with an <b>agent=Y</b> capability (but it MUST NOT do so if the
    server did not mention the agent capability). The <b>X</b> and <b>Y</b>
    strings may contain any printable ASCII characters except space (i.e., the
    byte range 32 &lt; x &lt; 127), and are typically of the form
    &quot;package/version&quot; (e.g., &quot;git/1.8.3.1&quot;). The agent
    strings are purely informative for statistics and debugging purposes, and
    MUST NOT be used to programmatically assume the presence or absence of
    particular features.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="OBJECT"><a class="permalink" href="#OBJECT">OBJECT-FORMAT</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">This capability, which takes a hash algorithm as an argument,
    indicates that the server supports the given hash algorithms. It may be sent
    multiple times; if so, the first one given is the one used in the ref
    advertisement.</p>
<p class="Pp">When provided by the client, this indicates that it intends to use
    the given hash algorithm to communicate. The algorithm provided must be one
    that the server supports.</p>
<p class="Pp">If this capability is not provided, it is assumed that the only
    supported algorithm is SHA-1.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="SYMREF"><a class="permalink" href="#SYMREF">SYMREF</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">This parameterized capability is used to inform the receiver which
    symbolic ref points to which ref; for example,
    &quot;symref=HEAD:refs/heads/master&quot; tells the receiver that HEAD
    points to master. This capability can be repeated to represent multiple
    symrefs.</p>
<p class="Pp">Servers SHOULD include this capability for the HEAD symref if it
    is one of the refs being sent.</p>
<p class="Pp">Clients MAY use the parameters from this capability to select the
    proper initial branch when cloning a repository.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="SHALLOW"><a class="permalink" href="#SHALLOW">SHALLOW</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">This capability adds &quot;deepen&quot;, &quot;shallow&quot; and
    &quot;unshallow&quot; commands to the fetch-pack/upload-pack protocol so
    clients can request shallow clones.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DEEPEN"><a class="permalink" href="#DEEPEN">DEEPEN-SINCE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">This capability adds &quot;deepen-since&quot; command to
    fetch-pack/upload-pack protocol so the client can request shallow clones
    that are cut at a specific time, instead of depth. Internally it&#x2019;s
    equivalent of doing &quot;rev-list --max-age=&lt;timestamp&gt;&quot; on the
    server side. &quot;deepen-since&quot; cannot be used with
    &quot;deepen&quot;.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DEEPEN~2"><a class="permalink" href="#DEEPEN~2">DEEPEN-NOT</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">This capability adds &quot;deepen-not&quot; command to
    fetch-pack/upload-pack protocol so the client can request shallow clones
    that are cut at a specific revision, instead of depth. Internally
    it&#x2019;s equivalent of doing &quot;rev-list --not &lt;rev&gt;&quot; on
    the server side. &quot;deepen-not&quot; cannot be used with
    &quot;deepen&quot;, but can be used with &quot;deepen-since&quot;.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DEEPEN~3"><a class="permalink" href="#DEEPEN~3">DEEPEN-RELATIVE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">If this capability is requested by the client, the semantics of
    &quot;deepen&quot; command is changed. The &quot;depth&quot; argument is the
    depth from the current shallow boundary, instead of the depth from remote
    refs.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="NO~2"><a class="permalink" href="#NO~2">NO-PROGRESS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The client was started with &quot;git clone -q&quot; or something,
    and doesn&#x2019;t want that side band 2. Basically the client just says
    &quot;I do not wish to receive stream 2 on sideband, so do not send it to
    me, and if you did, I will drop it on the floor anyway&quot;. However, the
    sideband channel 3 is still used for error responses.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="INCLUDE"><a class="permalink" href="#INCLUDE">INCLUDE-TAG</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The <i>include-tag</i> capability is about sending annotated tags
    if we are sending objects they point to. If we pack an object to the client,
    and a tag object points exactly at that object, we pack the tag object too.
    In general this allows a client to get all new annotated tags when it
    fetches a branch, in a single network connection.</p>
<p class="Pp">Clients MAY always send include-tag, hardcoding it into a request
    when the server advertises this capability. The decision for a client to
    request include-tag only has to do with the client&#x2019;s desires for tag
    data, whether or not a server had advertised objects in the refs/tags/*
    namespace.</p>
<p class="Pp">Servers MUST pack the tags if their referrant is packed and the
    client has requested include-tags.</p>
<p class="Pp">Clients MUST be prepared for the case where a server has ignored
    include-tag and has not actually sent tags in the pack. In such cases the
    client SHOULD issue a subsequent fetch to acquire the tags that include-tag
    would have otherwise given the client.</p>
<p class="Pp">The server SHOULD send include-tag, if it supports it, regardless
    of whether or not there are tags available.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="REPORT"><a class="permalink" href="#REPORT">REPORT-STATUS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The receive-pack process can receive a <i>report-status</i>
    capability, which tells it that the client wants a report of what happened
    after a packfile upload and reference update. If the pushing client requests
    this capability, after unpacking and updating references the server will
    respond with whether the packfile unpacked successfully and if each
    reference was updated successfully. If any of those were not successful, it
    will send back an error message. See <b>gitprotocol-pack</b>(5) for example
    messages.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="REPORT~2"><a class="permalink" href="#REPORT~2">REPORT-STATUS-V2</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Capability <i>report-status-v2</i> extends capability
    <i>report-status</i> by adding new &quot;option&quot; directives in order to
    support reference rewritten by the &quot;proc-receive&quot; hook. The
    &quot;proc-receive&quot; hook may handle a command for a pseudo-reference
    which may create or update a reference with different name, new-oid, and
    old-oid. While the capability <i>report-status</i> cannot report for such
    case. See <b>gitprotocol-pack</b>(5) for details.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DELETE"><a class="permalink" href="#DELETE">DELETE-REFS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">If the server sends back the <i>delete-refs</i> capability, it
    means that it is capable of accepting a zero-id value as the target value of
    a reference update. It is not sent back by the client, it simply informs the
    client that it can be sent zero-id values to delete references.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="QUIET"><a class="permalink" href="#QUIET">QUIET</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">If the receive-pack server advertises the <i>quiet</i> capability,
    it is capable of silencing human-readable progress output which otherwise
    may be shown when processing the received pack. A send-pack client should
    respond with the <i>quiet</i> capability to suppress server-side progress
    reporting if the local progress reporting is also being suppressed (e.g.,
    via <b>push -q</b>, or if stderr does not go to a tty).</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="ATOMIC"><a class="permalink" href="#ATOMIC">ATOMIC</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">If the server sends the <i>atomic</i> capability it is capable of
    accepting atomic pushes. If the pushing client requests this capability, the
    server will update the refs in one atomic transaction. Either all refs are
    updated or none.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="PUSH"><a class="permalink" href="#PUSH">PUSH-OPTIONS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">If the server sends the <i>push-options</i> capability it is able
    to accept push options after the update commands have been sent, but before
    the packfile is streamed. If the pushing client requests this capability,
    the server will pass the options to the pre- and post- receive hooks that
    process this push request.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="ALLOW"><a class="permalink" href="#ALLOW">ALLOW-TIP-SHA1-IN-WANT</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">If the upload-pack server advertises this capability, fetch-pack
    may send &quot;want&quot; lines with object names that exist at the server
    but are not advertised by upload-pack. For historical reasons, the name of
    this capability contains &quot;sha1&quot;. Object names are always given
    using the object format negotiated through the <i>object-format</i>
    capability.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="ALLOW~2"><a class="permalink" href="#ALLOW~2">ALLOW-REACHABLE-SHA1-IN-WANT</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">If the upload-pack server advertises this capability, fetch-pack
    may send &quot;want&quot; lines with object names that exist at the server
    but are not advertised by upload-pack. For historical reasons, the name of
    this capability contains &quot;sha1&quot;. Object names are always given
    using the object format negotiated through the <i>object-format</i>
    capability.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="PUSH~2"><a class="permalink" href="#PUSH~2">PUSH-CERT=&lt;NONCE&gt;</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The receive-pack server that advertises this capability is willing
    to accept a signed push certificate, and asks the &lt;nonce&gt; to be
    included in the push certificate. A send-pack client MUST NOT send a
    push-cert packet unless the receive-pack server advertises this
  capability.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="FILTER"><a class="permalink" href="#FILTER">FILTER</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">If the upload-pack server advertises the <i>filter</i> capability,
    fetch-pack may send &quot;filter&quot; commands to request a partial clone
    or partial fetch and request that the server omit various objects from the
    packfile.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="SESSION"><a class="permalink" href="#SESSION">SESSION-ID=&lt;SESSION
  ID&gt;</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The server may advertise a session ID that can be used to identify
    this process across multiple requests. The client may advertise its own
    session ID back to the server as well.</p>
<p class="Pp">Session IDs should be unique to a given process. They must fit
    within a packet-line, and must not contain non-printable or whitespace
    characters. The current implementation uses trace2 session IDs (see
    <b>api-trace2</b>[1] for details), but this may change and users of the
    session ID should not rely on this fact.</p>
