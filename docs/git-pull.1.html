<i>git pull</i> [&lt;options&gt;] [&lt;repository&gt; [&lt;refspec&gt;...]]

Incorporates changes from a remote repository into the current branch. In its
  default mode, <b>git pull</b> is shorthand for <b>git fetch</b> followed by
  <b>git merge FETCH_HEAD</b>.
<p class="Pp">More precisely, <i>git pull</i> runs <i>git fetch</i> with the
    given parameters and calls <i>git merge</i> to merge the retrieved branch
    heads into the current branch. With <b>--rebase</b>, it runs <i>git
    rebase</i> instead of <i>git merge</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">&lt;repository&gt; should be the name of a remote repository as
    passed to <b>git-fetch</b>(1). &lt;refspec&gt; can name an arbitrary remote
    ref (for example, the name of a tag) or even a collection of refs with
    corresponding remote-tracking branches (e.g.,
    refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*), but usually it is the name of a branch
    in the remote repository.</p>
<p class="Pp">Default values for &lt;repository&gt; and &lt;branch&gt; are read
    from the &quot;remote&quot; and &quot;merge&quot; configuration for the
    current branch as set by <b>git-branch</b>(1) <b>--track</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Assume the following history exists and the current branch is
    &quot;<b>master</b>&quot;:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
          A---B---C master on origin
         /
    D---E---F---G master
        ^
        origin/master in your repository
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">Then &quot;<b>git pull</b>&quot; will fetch and replay the changes
    from the remote <b>master</b> branch since it diverged from the local
    <b>master</b> (i.e., <b>E</b>) until its current commit (<b>C</b>) on top of
    <b>master</b> and record the result in a new commit along with the names of
    the two parent commits and a log message from the user describing the
    changes.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
          A---B---C origin/master
         /         \
    D---E---F---G---H master
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">See <b>git-merge</b>(1) for details, including how conflicts are
    presented and handled.</p>
<p class="Pp">In Git 1.7.0 or later, to cancel a conflicting merge, use <b>git
    reset --merge</b>. <b>Warning</b>: In older versions of Git, running <i>git
    pull</i> with uncommitted changes is discouraged: while possible, it leaves
    you in a state that may be hard to back out of in the case of a
  conflict.</p>
<p class="Pp">If any of the remote changes overlap with local uncommitted
    changes, the merge will be automatically canceled and the work tree
    untouched. It is generally best to get any local changes in working order
    before pulling or stash them away with <b>git-stash</b>(1).</p>

-q, --quiet
<div class="Bd-indent">This is passed to both underlying git-fetch to squelch
  reporting of during transfer, and underlying git-merge to squelch output
  during merging.</div>
<p class="Pp">-v, --verbose</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Pass --verbose to git-fetch and git-merge.</div>
<p class="Pp">--[no-]recurse-submodules[=yes|on-demand|no]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This option controls if new commits of all populated
  submodules should be fetched and updated, too (see <b>git-config</b>(1) and
  <b>gitmodules</b>(5)).
<p class="Pp">If the checkout is done via rebase, local submodule commits are
    rebased as well.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the update is done via merge, the submodule conflicts are
    resolved and checked out.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Options_related_to_merging"><a class="permalink" href="#Options_related_to_merging">Options
  related to merging</a></h2>
--commit, --no-commit
<div class="Bd-indent">Perform the merge and commit the result. This option can
  be used to override --no-commit.
<p class="Pp">With --no-commit perform the merge and stop just before creating a
    merge commit, to give the user a chance to inspect and further tweak the
    merge result before committing.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that fast-forward updates do not create a merge commit and
    therefore there is no way to stop those merges with --no-commit. Thus, if
    you want to ensure your branch is not changed or updated by the merge
    command, use --no-ff with --no-commit.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--edit, -e, --no-edit</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Invoke an editor before committing successful mechanical
  merge to further edit the auto-generated merge message, so that the user can
  explain and justify the merge. The <b>--no-edit</b> option can be used to
  accept the auto-generated message (this is generally discouraged).
<p class="Pp">Older scripts may depend on the historical behaviour of not
    allowing the user to edit the merge log message. They will see an editor
    opened when they run <b>git merge</b>. To make it easier to adjust such
    scripts to the updated behaviour, the environment variable
    <b>GIT_MERGE_AUTOEDIT</b> can be set to <b>no</b> at the beginning of
  them.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--cleanup=&lt;mode&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This option determines how the merge message will be
  cleaned up before commiting. See <b>git-commit</b>(1) for more details. In
  addition, if the <i>&lt;mode&gt;</i> is given a value of <b>scissors</b>,
  scissors will be appended to <b>MERGE_MSG</b> before being passed on to the
  commit machinery in the case of a merge conflict.</div>
<p class="Pp">--ff, --no-ff, --ff-only</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Specifies how a merge is handled when the merged-in
  history is already a descendant of the current history. <b>--ff</b> is the
  default unless merging an annotated (and possibly signed) tag that is not
  stored in its natural place in the <b>refs/tags/</b> hierarchy, in which case
  <b>--no-ff</b> is assumed.
<p class="Pp">With <b>--ff</b>, when possible resolve the merge as a
    fast-forward (only update the branch pointer to match the merged branch; do
    not create a merge commit). When not possible (when the merged-in history is
    not a descendant of the current history), create a merge commit.</p>
<p class="Pp">With <b>--no-ff</b>, create a merge commit in all cases, even when
    the merge could instead be resolved as a fast-forward.</p>
<p class="Pp">With <b>--ff-only</b>, resolve the merge as a fast-forward when
    possible. When not possible, refuse to merge and exit with a non-zero
    status.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">-S[&lt;keyid&gt;], --gpg-sign[=&lt;keyid&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">GPG-sign the resulting merge commit. The <b>keyid</b>
  argument is optional and defaults to the committer identity; if specified, it
  must be stuck to the option without a space.</div>
<p class="Pp">--log[=&lt;n&gt;], --no-log</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">In addition to branch names, populate the log message
  with one-line descriptions from at most &lt;n&gt; actual commits that are
  being merged. See also <b>git-fmt-merge-msg</b>(1).
<p class="Pp">With --no-log do not list one-line descriptions from the actual
    commits being merged.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--signoff, --no-signoff</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Add Signed-off-by line by the committer at the end of the
  commit log message. The meaning of a signoff depends on the project, but it
  typically certifies that committer has the rights to submit this work under
  the same license and agrees to a Developer Certificate of Origin (see
  <b>http://developercertificate.org/</b> for more information).
<p class="Pp">With --no-signoff do not add a Signed-off-by line.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--stat, -n, --no-stat</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show a diffstat at the end of the merge. The diffstat is
  also controlled by the configuration option merge.stat.
<p class="Pp">With -n or --no-stat do not show a diffstat at the end of the
    merge.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--squash, --no-squash</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Produce the working tree and index state as if a real
  merge happened (except for the merge information), but do not actually make a
  commit, move the <b>HEAD</b>, or record <b>$GIT_DIR/MERGE_HEAD</b> (to cause
  the next <b>git commit</b> command to create a merge commit). This allows you
  to create a single commit on top of the current branch whose effect is the
  same as merging another branch (or more in case of an octopus).
<p class="Pp">With --no-squash perform the merge and commit the result. This
    option can be used to override --squash.</p>
<p class="Pp">With --squash, --commit is not allowed, and will fail.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--no-verify</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This option bypasses the pre-merge and commit-msg hooks.
  See also <b>githooks</b>(5).</div>
<p class="Pp">-s &lt;strategy&gt;, --strategy=&lt;strategy&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Use the given merge strategy; can be supplied more than
  once to specify them in the order they should be tried. If there is no
  <b>-s</b> option, a built-in list of strategies is used instead (<i>git
  merge-recursive</i> when merging a single head, <i>git merge-octopus</i>
  otherwise).</div>
<p class="Pp">-X &lt;option&gt;, --strategy-option=&lt;option&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Pass merge strategy specific option through to the merge
  strategy.</div>
<p class="Pp">--verify-signatures, --no-verify-signatures</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Verify that the tip commit of the side branch being
  merged is signed with a valid key, i.e. a key that has a valid uid: in the
  default trust model, this means the signing key has been signed by a trusted
  key. If the tip commit of the side branch is not signed with a valid key, the
  merge is aborted.</div>
<p class="Pp">--summary, --no-summary</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Synonyms to --stat and --no-stat; these are deprecated
  and will be removed in the future.</div>
<p class="Pp">--allow-unrelated-histories</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">By default, <b>git merge</b> command refuses to merge
  histories that do not share a common ancestor. This option can be used to
  override this safety when merging histories of two projects that started their
  lives independently. As that is a very rare occasion, no configuration
  variable to enable this by default exists and will not be added.</div>
<p class="Pp">-r, --rebase[=false|true|merges|preserve|interactive]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When true, rebase the current branch on top of the
  upstream branch after fetching. If there is a remote-tracking branch
  corresponding to the upstream branch and the upstream branch was rebased since
  last fetched, the rebase uses that information to avoid rebasing non-local
  changes.
<p class="Pp">When set to <b>merges</b>, rebase using <b>git rebase
    --rebase-merges</b> so that the local merge commits are included in the
    rebase (see <b>git-rebase</b>(1) for details).</p>
<p class="Pp">When set to <b>preserve</b> (deprecated in favor of
    <b>merges</b>), rebase with the <b>--preserve-merges</b> option passed to
    <b>git rebase</b> so that locally created merge commits will not be
    flattened.</p>
<p class="Pp">When false, merge the current branch into the upstream branch.</p>
<p class="Pp">When <b>interactive</b>, enable the interactive mode of
  rebase.</p>
<p class="Pp">See <b>pull.rebase</b>, <b>branch.&lt;name&gt;.rebase</b> and
    <b>branch.autoSetupRebase</b> in <b>git-config</b>(1) if you want to make
    <b>git pull</b> always use <b>--rebase</b> instead of merging.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<br/>
<b>Note</b>
<br/>
This is a potentially <i>dangerous</i> mode of operation. It rewrites history,
  which does not bode well when you published that history already. Do
  <b>not</b> use this option unless you have read <b>git-rebase</b>(1)
  carefully.
<p class="Pp"></p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--no-rebase</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Override earlier --rebase.</div>
<p class="Pp">--autostash, --no-autostash</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Before starting rebase, stash local modifications away
  (see <b>git-stash</b>(1)) if needed, and apply the stash entry when done.
  <b>--no-autostash</b> is useful to override the <b>rebase.autoStash</b>
  configuration variable (see <b>git-config</b>(1)).
<p class="Pp">This option is only valid when &quot;--rebase&quot; is used.</p>

--all
<div class="Bd-indent">Fetch all remotes.</div>
<p class="Pp">-a, --append</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Append ref names and object names of fetched refs to the
  existing contents of <b>.git/FETCH_HEAD</b>. Without this option old data in
  <b>.git/FETCH_HEAD</b> will be overwritten.</div>
<p class="Pp">--depth=&lt;depth&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Limit fetching to the specified number of commits from
  the tip of each remote branch history. If fetching to a <i>shallow</i>
  repository created by <b>git clone</b> with <b>--depth=&lt;depth&gt;</b>
  option (see <b>git-clone</b>(1)), deepen or shorten the history to the
  specified number of commits. Tags for the deepened commits are not
  fetched.</div>
<p class="Pp">--deepen=&lt;depth&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Similar to --depth, except it specifies the number of
  commits from the current shallow boundary instead of from the tip of each
  remote branch history.</div>
<p class="Pp">--shallow-since=&lt;date&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Deepen or shorten the history of a shallow repository to
  include all reachable commits after &lt;date&gt;.</div>
<p class="Pp">--shallow-exclude=&lt;revision&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Deepen or shorten the history of a shallow repository to
  exclude commits reachable from a specified remote branch or tag. This option
  can be specified multiple times.</div>
<p class="Pp">--unshallow</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If the source repository is complete, convert a shallow
  repository to a complete one, removing all the limitations imposed by shallow
  repositories.
<p class="Pp">If the source repository is shallow, fetch as much as possible so
    that the current repository has the same history as the source
  repository.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--update-shallow</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">By default when fetching from a shallow repository,
  <b>git fetch</b> refuses refs that require updating .git/shallow. This option
  updates .git/shallow and accept such refs.</div>
<p class="Pp">--negotiation-tip=&lt;commit|glob&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">By default, Git will report, to the server, commits
  reachable from all local refs to find common commits in an attempt to reduce
  the size of the to-be-received packfile. If specified, Git will only report
  commits reachable from the given tips. This is useful to speed up fetches when
  the user knows which local ref is likely to have commits in common with the
  upstream ref being fetched.
<p class="Pp">This option may be specified more than once; if so, Git will
    report commits reachable from any of the given commits.</p>
<p class="Pp">The argument to this option may be a glob on ref names, a ref, or
    the (possibly abbreviated) SHA-1 of a commit. Specifying a glob is
    equivalent to specifying this option multiple times, one for each matching
    ref name.</p>
<p class="Pp">See also the <b>fetch.negotiationAlgorithm</b> configuration
    variable documented in <b>git-config</b>(1).</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">-f, --force</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When <i>git fetch</i> is used with
  <b>&lt;src&gt;:&lt;dst&gt;</b> refspec it may refuse to update the local
  branch as discussed in the <b>&lt;refspec&gt;</b> part of the

<p class="Pp">-k, --keep</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Keep downloaded pack.</div>
<p class="Pp">--no-tags</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">By default, tags that point at objects that are
  downloaded from the remote repository are fetched and stored locally. This
  option disables this automatic tag following. The default behavior for a
  remote may be specified with the remote.&lt;name&gt;.tagOpt setting. See
  <b>git-config</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">-u, --update-head-ok</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">By default <i>git fetch</i> refuses to update the head
  which corresponds to the current branch. This flag disables the check. This is
  purely for the internal use for <i>git pull</i> to communicate with <i>git
  fetch</i>, and unless you are implementing your own Porcelain you are not
  supposed to use it.</div>
<p class="Pp">--upload-pack &lt;upload-pack&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When given, and the repository to fetch from is handled
  by <i>git fetch-pack</i>, <b>--exec=&lt;upload-pack&gt;</b> is passed to the
  command to specify non-default path for the command run on the other
  end.</div>
<p class="Pp">--progress</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Progress status is reported on the standard error stream
  by default when it is attached to a terminal, unless -q is specified. This
  flag forces progress status even if the standard error stream is not directed
  to a terminal.</div>
<p class="Pp">-o &lt;option&gt;, --server-option=&lt;option&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Transmit the given string to the server when
  communicating using protocol version 2. The given string must not contain a
  NUL or LF character. The server&#x2019;s handling of server options, including
  unknown ones, is server-specific. When multiple
  <b>--server-option=&lt;option&gt;</b> are given, they are all sent to the
  other side in the order listed on the command line.</div>
<p class="Pp">--show-forced-updates</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">By default, git checks if a branch is force-updated
  during fetch. This can be disabled through fetch.showForcedUpdates, but the
  --show-forced-updates option guarantees this check occurs. See
  <b>git-config</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">--no-show-forced-updates</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">By default, git checks if a branch is force-updated
  during fetch. Pass --no-show-forced-updates or set fetch.showForcedUpdates to
  false to skip this check for performance reasons. If used during
  <i>git-pull</i> the --ff-only option will still check for forced updates
  before attempting a fast-forward update. See <b>git-config</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">-4, --ipv4</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Use IPv4 addresses only, ignoring IPv6 addresses.</div>
<p class="Pp">-6, --ipv6</p>

<p class="Pp">&lt;repository&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The &quot;remote&quot; repository that is the source of a
  fetch or pull operation. This parameter can be either a URL (see the section
  GIT URLS below) or the name of a remote (see the section REMOTES below).</div>
<p class="Pp">&lt;refspec&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Specifies which refs to fetch and which local refs to
  update. When no &lt;refspec&gt;s appear on the command line, the refs to fetch
  are read from <b>remote.&lt;repository&gt;.fetch</b> variables instead (see
  <b>git-fetch</b>(1)).
<p class="Pp">The format of a &lt;refspec&gt; parameter is an optional plus
    <b>+</b>, followed by the source &lt;src&gt;, followed by a colon <b>:</b>,
    followed by the destination ref &lt;dst&gt;. The colon can be omitted when
    &lt;dst&gt; is empty. &lt;src&gt; is typically a ref, but it can also be a
    fully spelled hex object name.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>tag &lt;tag&gt;</b> means the same as
    <b>refs/tags/&lt;tag&gt;:refs/tags/&lt;tag&gt;</b>; it requests fetching
    everything up to the given tag.</p>
<p class="Pp">The remote ref that matches &lt;src&gt; is fetched, and if
    &lt;dst&gt; is not an empty string, an attempt is made to update the local
    ref that matches it.</p>
<p class="Pp">Whether that update is allowed without <b>--force</b> depends on
    the ref namespace it&#x2019;s being fetched to, the type of object being
    fetched, and whether the update is considered to be a fast-forward.
    Generally, the same rules apply for fetching as when pushing, see the
    <b>&lt;refspec&gt;...</b> section of <b>git-push</b>(1) for what those are.
    Exceptions to those rules particular to <i>git fetch</i> are noted
  below.</p>
<p class="Pp">Until Git version 2.20, and unlike when pushing with
    <b>git-push</b>(1), any updates to <b>refs/tags/*</b> would be accepted
    without <b>+</b> in the refspec (or <b>--force</b>). When fetching, we
    promiscuously considered all tag updates from a remote to be forced fetches.
    Since Git version 2.20, fetching to update <b>refs/tags/*</b> works the same
    way as when pushing. I.e. any updates will be rejected without <b>+</b> in
    the refspec (or <b>--force</b>).</p>
<p class="Pp">Unlike when pushing with <b>git-push</b>(1), any updates outside
    of <b>refs/{tags,heads}/*</b> will be accepted without <b>+</b> in the
    refspec (or <b>--force</b>), whether that&#x2019;s swapping e.g. a tree
    object for a blob, or a commit for another commit that&#x2019;s
    doesn&#x2019;t have the previous commit as an ancestor etc.</p>
<p class="Pp">Unlike when pushing with <b>git-push</b>(1), there is no
    configuration which&#x2019;ll amend these rules, and nothing like a
    <b>pre-fetch</b> hook analogous to the <b>pre-receive</b> hook.</p>
<p class="Pp">As with pushing with <b>git-push</b>(1), all of the rules
    described above about what&#x2019;s not allowed as an update can be
    overridden by adding an the optional leading <b>+</b> to a refspec (or using
    <b>--force</b> command line option). The only exception to this is that no
    amount of forcing will make the <b>refs/heads/*</b> namespace accept a
    non-commit object.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<br/>
<b>Note</b>
<br/>
When the remote branch you want to fetch is known to be rewound and rebased
  regularly, it is expected that its new tip will not be descendant of its
  previous tip (as stored in your remote-tracking branch the last time you
  fetched). You would want to use the <b>+</b> sign to indicate non-fast-forward
  updates will be needed for such branches. There is no way to determine or
  declare that a branch will be made available in a repository with this
  behavior; the pulling user simply must know this is the expected usage pattern
  for a branch.
<p class="Pp"></p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<br/>
<b>Note</b>
<br/>
There is a difference between listing multiple &lt;refspec&gt; directly on
  <i>git pull</i> command line and having multiple
  <b>remote.&lt;repository&gt;.fetch</b> entries in your configuration for a
  &lt;repository&gt; and running a <i>git pull</i> command without any explicit
  &lt;refspec&gt; parameters. &lt;refspec&gt;s listed explicitly on the command
  line are always merged into the current branch after fetching. In other words,
  if you list more than one remote ref, <i>git pull</i> will create an Octopus
  merge. On the other hand, if you do not list any explicit &lt;refspec&gt;
  parameter on the command line, <i>git pull</i> will fetch all the
  &lt;refspec&gt;s it finds in the <b>remote.&lt;repository&gt;.fetch</b>
  configuration and merge only the first &lt;refspec&gt; found into the current
  branch. This is because making an Octopus from remote refs is rarely done,
  while keeping track of multiple remote heads in one-go by fetching more than
  one is often useful.

  URLS</a></h1>
In general, URLs contain information about the transport protocol, the address
  of the remote server, and the path to the repository. Depending on the
  transport protocol, some of this information may be absent.
<p class="Pp">Git supports ssh, git, http, and https protocols (in addition,
    ftp, and ftps can be used for fetching, but this is inefficient and
    deprecated; do not use it).</p>
<p class="Pp">The native transport (i.e. git:// URL) does no authentication and
    should be used with caution on unsecured networks.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following syntaxes may be used with them:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;ssh://[user@]host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;git://host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;http[s]://host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;ftp[s]://host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/</div>
<p class="Pp">An alternative scp-like syntax may also be used with the ssh
    protocol:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;[user@]host.xz:path/to/repo.git/</div>
<p class="Pp">This syntax is only recognized if there are no slashes before the
    first colon. This helps differentiate a local path that contains a colon.
    For example the local path <b>foo:bar</b> could be specified as an absolute
    path or <b>./foo:bar</b> to avoid being misinterpreted as an ssh url.</p>
<p class="Pp">The ssh and git protocols additionally support ~username
    expansion:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;ssh://[user@]host.xz[:port]/~[user]/path/to/repo.git/</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;git://host.xz[:port]/~[user]/path/to/repo.git/</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;[user@]host.xz:/~[user]/path/to/repo.git/</div>
<p class="Pp">For local repositories, also supported by Git natively, the
    following syntaxes may be used:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;/path/to/repo.git/</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;file:///path/to/repo.git/</div>
<p class="Pp">These two syntaxes are mostly equivalent, except when cloning,
    when the former implies --local option. See <b>git-clone</b>(1) for
  details.</p>
<p class="Pp">When Git doesn&#x2019;t know how to handle a certain transport
    protocol, it attempts to use the <i>remote-&lt;transport&gt;</i> remote
    helper, if one exists. To explicitly request a remote helper, the following
    syntax may be used:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;&lt;transport&gt;::&lt;address&gt;</div>
<p class="Pp">where &lt;address&gt; may be a path, a server and path, or an
    arbitrary URL-like string recognized by the specific remote helper being
    invoked. See <b>gitremote-helpers</b>(7) for details.</p>
<p class="Pp">If there are a large number of similarly-named remote repositories
    and you want to use a different format for them (such that the URLs you use
    will be rewritten into URLs that work), you can create a configuration
    section of the form:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
        [url &quot;&lt;actual url base&gt;&quot;]
                insteadOf = &lt;other url base&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">For example, with this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
        [url &quot;git://git.host.xz/&quot;]
                insteadOf = host.xz:/path/to/
                insteadOf = work:
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">a URL like &quot;work:repo.git&quot; or like
    &quot;host.xz:/path/to/repo.git&quot; will be rewritten in any context that
    takes a URL to be &quot;git://git.host.xz/repo.git&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you want to rewrite URLs for push only, you can create a
    configuration section of the form:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
        [url &quot;&lt;actual url base&gt;&quot;]
                pushInsteadOf = &lt;other url base&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">For example, with this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
        [url &quot;ssh://example.org/&quot;]
                pushInsteadOf = git://example.org/
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">a URL like &quot;git://example.org/path/to/repo.git&quot; will be
    rewritten to &quot;ssh://example.org/path/to/repo.git&quot; for pushes, but
    pulls will still use the original URL.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="MERGE_STRATEGIES"><a class="permalink" href="#MERGE_STRATEGIES">MERGE
  STRATEGIES</a></h1>
The merge mechanism (<b>git merge</b> and <b>git pull</b> commands) allows the
  backend <i>merge strategies</i> to be chosen with <b>-s</b> option. Some
  strategies can also take their own options, which can be passed by giving
  <b>-X&lt;option&gt;</b> arguments to <b>git merge</b> and/or <b>git pull</b>.
<p class="Pp">resolve</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This can only resolve two heads (i.e. the current branch
  and another branch you pulled from) using a 3-way merge algorithm. It tries to
  carefully detect criss-cross merge ambiguities and is considered generally
  safe and fast.</div>
<p class="Pp">recursive</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This can only resolve two heads using a 3-way merge
  algorithm. When there is more than one common ancestor that can be used for
  3-way merge, it creates a merged tree of the common ancestors and uses that as
  the reference tree for the 3-way merge. This has been reported to result in
  fewer merge conflicts without causing mismerges by tests done on actual merge
  commits taken from Linux 2.6 kernel development history. Additionally this can
  detect and handle merges involving renames, but currently cannot make use of
  detected copies. This is the default merge strategy when pulling or merging
  one branch.
<p class="Pp">The <i>recursive</i> strategy can take the following options:</p>
<p class="Pp">ours</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This option forces conflicting hunks to be auto-resolved
  cleanly by favoring <i>our</i> version. Changes from the other tree that do
  not conflict with our side are reflected to the merge result. For a binary
  file, the entire contents are taken from our side.
<p class="Pp">This should not be confused with the <i>ours</i> merge strategy,
    which does not even look at what the other tree contains at all. It discards
    everything the other tree did, declaring <i>our</i> history contains all
    that happened in it.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">theirs</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This is the opposite of <i>ours</i>; note that, unlike
  <i>ours</i>, there is no <i>theirs</i> merge strategy to confuse this merge
  option with.</div>
<p class="Pp">patience</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">With this option, <i>merge-recursive</i> spends a little
  extra time to avoid mismerges that sometimes occur due to unimportant matching
  lines (e.g., braces from distinct functions). Use this when the branches to be
  merged have diverged wildly. See also <b>git-diff</b>(1)
  <b>--patience</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">diff-algorithm=[patience|minimal|histogram|myers]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Tells <i>merge-recursive</i> to use a different diff
  algorithm, which can help avoid mismerges that occur due to unimportant
  matching lines (such as braces from distinct functions). See also
  <b>git-diff</b>(1) <b>--diff-algorithm</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">ignore-space-change, ignore-all-space, ignore-space-at-eol,
    ignore-cr-at-eol</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Treats lines with the indicated type of whitespace change
  as unchanged for the sake of a three-way merge. Whitespace changes mixed with
  other changes to a line are not ignored. See also <b>git-diff</b>(1)
  <b>-b</b>, <b>-w</b>, <b>--ignore-space-at-eol</b>, and
  <b>--ignore-cr-at-eol</b>.
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;If <i>their</i> version only introduces
  whitespace changes to a line, <i>our</i> version is used;</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;If <i>our</i> version introduces whitespace
  changes but <i>their</i> version includes a substantial change, <i>their</i>
  version is used;</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Otherwise, the merge proceeds in the usual
  way.</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp">renormalize</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This runs a virtual check-out and check-in of all three
  stages of a file when resolving a three-way merge. This option is meant to be
  used when merging branches with different clean filters or end-of-line
  normalization rules. See &quot;Merging branches with differing
  checkin/checkout attributes&quot; in <b>gitattributes</b>(5) for
  details.</div>
<p class="Pp">no-renormalize</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Disables the <b>renormalize</b> option. This overrides
  the <b>merge.renormalize</b> configuration variable.</div>
<p class="Pp">no-renames</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Turn off rename detection. This overrides the
  <b>merge.renames</b> configuration variable. See also <b>git-diff</b>(1)
  <b>--no-renames</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">find-renames[=&lt;n&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Turn on rename detection, optionally setting the
  similarity threshold. This is the default. This overrides the
  <i>merge.renames</i> configuration variable. See also <b>git-diff</b>(1)
  <b>--find-renames</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">rename-threshold=&lt;n&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Deprecated synonym for
  <b>find-renames=&lt;n&gt;</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">subtree[=&lt;path&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This option is a more advanced form of <i>subtree</i>
  strategy, where the strategy makes a guess on how two trees must be shifted to
  match with each other when merging. Instead, the specified path is prefixed
  (or stripped from the beginning) to make the shape of two trees to
  match.</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp">octopus</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This resolves cases with more than two heads, but refuses
  to do a complex merge that needs manual resolution. It is primarily meant to
  be used for bundling topic branch heads together. This is the default merge
  strategy when pulling or merging more than one branch.</div>
<p class="Pp">ours</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This resolves any number of heads, but the resulting tree
  of the merge is always that of the current branch head, effectively ignoring
  all changes from all other branches. It is meant to be used to supersede old
  development history of side branches. Note that this is different from the
  -Xours option to the <i>recursive</i> merge strategy.</div>
<p class="Pp">subtree</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This is a modified recursive strategy. When merging trees
  A and B, if B corresponds to a subtree of A, B is first adjusted to match the
  tree structure of A, instead of reading the trees at the same level. This
  adjustment is also done to the common ancestor tree.</div>
<p class="Pp">With the strategies that use 3-way merge (including the default,
    <i>recursive</i>), if a change is made on both branches, but later reverted
    on one of the branches, that change will be present in the merged result;
    some people find this behavior confusing. It occurs because only the heads
    and the merge base are considered when performing a merge, not the
    individual commits. The merge algorithm therefore considers the reverted
    change as no change at all, and substitutes the changed version instead.</p>

  BEHAVIOUR</a></h1>
Often people use <b>git pull</b> without giving any parameter. Traditionally,
  this has been equivalent to saying <b>git pull origin</b>. However, when
  configuration <b>branch.&lt;name&gt;.remote</b> is present while on branch
  <b>&lt;name&gt;</b>, that value is used instead of <b>origin</b>.
<p class="Pp">In order to determine what URL to use to fetch from, the value of
    the configuration <b>remote.&lt;origin&gt;.url</b> is consulted and if there
    is not any such variable, the value on the <b>URL:</b> line in
    <b>$GIT_DIR/remotes/&lt;origin&gt;</b> is used.</p>
<p class="Pp">In order to determine what remote branches to fetch (and
    optionally store in the remote-tracking branches) when the command is run
    without any refspec parameters on the command line, values of the
    configuration variable <b>remote.&lt;origin&gt;.fetch</b> are consulted, and
    if there aren&#x2019;t any, <b>$GIT_DIR/remotes/&lt;origin&gt;</b> is
    consulted and its <b>Pull:</b> lines are used. In addition to the refspec
    formats described in the OPTIONS section, you can have a globbing refspec
    that looks like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">A globbing refspec must have a non-empty RHS (i.e. must store what
    were fetched in remote-tracking branches), and its LHS and RHS must end with
    <b>/*</b>. The above specifies that all remote branches are tracked using
    remote-tracking branches in <b>refs/remotes/origin/</b> hierarchy under the
    same name.</p>
<p class="Pp">The rule to determine which remote branch to merge after fetching
    is a bit involved, in order not to break backward compatibility.</p>
<p class="Pp">If explicit refspecs were given on the command line of <b>git
    pull</b>, they are all merged.</p>
<p class="Pp">When no refspec was given on the command line, then <b>git
    pull</b> uses the refspec from the configuration or
    <b>$GIT_DIR/remotes/&lt;origin&gt;</b>. In such cases, the following rules
    apply:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 1.If <b>branch.&lt;name&gt;.merge</b> configuration for
  the current branch <b>&lt;name&gt;</b> exists, that is the name of the branch
  at the remote site that is merged.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 2.If the refspec is a globbing one, nothing is
  merged.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 3.Otherwise the remote branch of the first refspec is

The fetch and push protocols are not designed to prevent one side from stealing
  data from the other repository that was not intended to be shared. If you have
  private data that you need to protect from a malicious peer, your best option
  is to store it in another repository. This applies to both clients and
  servers. In particular, namespaces on a server are not effective for read
  access control; you should only grant read access to a namespace to clients
  that you would trust with read access to the entire repository.
<p class="Pp">The known attack vectors are as follows:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 1.The victim sends &quot;have&quot; lines advertising
  the IDs of objects it has that are not explicitly intended to be shared but
  can be used to optimize the transfer if the peer also has them. The attacker
  chooses an object ID X to steal and sends a ref to X, but isn&#x2019;t
  required to send the content of X because the victim already has it. Now the
  victim believes that the attacker has X, and it sends the content of X back to
  the attacker later. (This attack is most straightforward for a client to
  perform on a server, by creating a ref to X in the namespace the client has
  access to and then fetching it. The most likely way for a server to perform it
  on a client is to &quot;merge&quot; X into a public branch and hope that the
  user does additional work on this branch and pushes it back to the server
  without noticing the merge.)</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 2.As in #1, the attacker chooses an object ID X to
  steal. The victim sends an object Y that the attacker already has, and the
  attacker falsely claims to have X and not Y, so the victim sends Y as a delta
  against X. The delta reveals regions of X that are similar to Y to the
  attacker.</div>

Using --recurse-submodules can only fetch new commits in already checked out
  submodules right now. When e.g. upstream added a new submodule in the just
  fetched commits of the superproject the submodule itself cannot be fetched,
  making it impossible to check out that submodule later without having to do a
  fetch again. This is expected to be fixed in a future Git version.
