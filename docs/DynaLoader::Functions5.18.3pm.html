<p class="Pp">This module provides a function-based interface to dynamic loading
    as used by Perl. Some details of dynamic loading are very
    platform-dependent, so correct use of these functions requires the
    programmer to be mindful of the space of platform variations.</p>

  <dd><i>MODULE_NAME</i> must be the name of a Perl module, in bareword syntax
      with <span class="Li">&quot;::&quot;</span> separators. The named module
      is presumed to be an XS extension following standard conventions, and its
      runtime-loadable C library file is searched for. If found, the name of the
      library file is returned. If it cannot be found, the function
      <span class="Li">&quot;die&quot;</span>s with an informative error
      message.
    <p class="Pp">If the named module is actually not an XS extension, or is not
        installed, or stores its C library in a non-standard place, there is a
        non-trivial danger that this function will find some other library file
        and believe it to be the right one. This function should therefore only
        be used when there is an expectation that the module is installed and
        would in normal operation load its corresponding C library.</p>

  <dt id="linkable_for_loadable("><a class="permalink" href="#linkable_for_loadable(">linkable_for_loadable(LOADABLE_FILENAME)</a></dt>
  <dd>If symbols in one runtime-loadable C library are to be made available to
      another runtime-loadable C library, depending on the platform it may be
      necessary to refer to the exporting library when linking the importing
      library. Generally this is not required on Unix, but it is required on
      Windows. Where it is required to refer to the exporting library at link
      time, the file used may be the loadable library file itself, or may be a
      separate file used only for this purpose. Given the loadable form of an
      exporting library, this function determines what is required at link time
      for an importing library.
    <p class="Pp"><i>LOADABLE_FILENAME</i> must be the name of a
        runtime-loadable C library file. The function checks what is required to
        link a library that will at runtime import symbols from this library. It
        returns a list (which will be empty on many platforms) of names of files
        that must be used as additional objects when linking the importing
        library.</p>

  <dd>Performs the job of &quot;linkable_for_loadable&quot; (which see for
      explanation), but based on a module name instead of a loadable library
      filename.
    <p class="Pp"><i>MODULE_NAME</i> must be the name of a Perl module, in
        bareword syntax with <span class="Li">&quot;::&quot;</span> separators.
        The function checks what is required to link a library that will at
        runtime import symbols from the loadable C library associated with the
        module. It returns a list (which will be empty on many platforms) of
        names of files that must be used as additional objects when linking the
        importing library.</p>

    <p class="Pp">On platforms incapable of making loaded symbols globally
        available, currently loading is liable to claim success while leaving
