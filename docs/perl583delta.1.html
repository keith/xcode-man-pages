   Set up some character translations and predefined strings.  \*(-- will
   give an unbreakable dash, \*(PI will give pi, \*(L" will give a left
   double quote, and \*(R" will give a right double quote.  \*(C+ will
   give a nicer C++.  Capital omega is used to do unbreakable dashes and
   therefore won't be available.  \*(C` and \*(C' expand to `' in nroff,
   nothing in troff, for use with C<>.

perl583delta - what is new for perl v5.8.3
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
This document describes differences between the 5.8.2 release and the 5.8.3
  release.
<p class="Pp">If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.6.1, first
    read the perl58delta, which describes differences between 5.6.0 and 5.8.0,
    and the perl581delta and perl582delta, which describe differences between
    5.8.0, 5.8.1 and 5.8.2</p>

A <span class="Li">&quot;SCALAR&quot;</span> method is now available for tied
  hashes. This is called when a tied hash is used in scalar context, such as
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    if (%tied_hash) {
        ...
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The old behaviour was that <span class="Li">%tied_hash</span>
    would return whatever would have been returned for that hash before the hash
    was tied (so usually 0). The new behaviour in the absence of a SCALAR method
    is to return TRUE if in the middle of an
    <span class="Li">&quot;each&quot;</span> iteration, and otherwise call
    FIRSTKEY to check if the hash is empty (making sure that a subsequent
    <span class="Li">&quot;each&quot;</span> will also begin by calling
    FIRSTKEY). Please see &quot;SCALAR&quot; in perltie for the full details and
    caveats.</p>

Using <b>substr()</b> on a UTF8 string could cause subsequent accesses on that
  string to return garbage. This was due to incorrect UTF8 offsets being cached,
  and is now fixed.
<p class="Pp"><b>join()</b> could return garbage when the same <b>join()</b>
    statement was used to process 8 bit data having earlier processed UTF8 data,
    due to the flags on that statement's temporary workspace not being reset
    correctly. This is now fixed.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;$a .. $b&quot;</span> will now work as
    expected when either <span class="Li">$a</span> or
    <span class="Li">$b</span> is <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span></p>
<p class="Pp">Using Unicode keys with tied hashes should now work correctly.</p>
<p class="Pp">Reading $^E now preserves $!. Previously, the C code implementing
    $^E did not preserve <span class="Li">&quot;errno&quot;</span>, so reading
    $^E could cause <span class="Li">&quot;errno&quot;</span> and therefore
    <span class="Li">$!</span> to change unexpectedly.</p>
<p class="Pp">Reentrant functions will (once more) work with C++. 5.8.2
    introduced a bugfix which accidentally broke the compilation of Perl
    extensions written in C++</p>

The hash code has been refactored to reduce source duplication. The external
  interface is unchanged, and aside from the bug fixes described above, there
  should be no change in behaviour.
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;hv_clear_placeholders&quot;</span> is now
    part of the perl API</p>
<p class="Pp">Some C macros have been tidied. In particular macros which create
    temporary local variables now name these variables more defensively, which
    should avoid bugs where names clash.</p>
<p class="Pp">&lt;signal.h&gt; is now always included.</p>

The regression test ext/threads/shared/t/wait.t fails on early RedHat 9 and
  HP-UX 10.20 due to bugs in their threading implementations. RedHat users
  should see https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2003-136.html and consider
  upgrading their glibc.

Detached threads aren't supported on Windows yet, as they may lead to memory

<p class="Pp">There is a known race condition opening scripts in
    <span class="Li">&quot;suidperl&quot;</span>.
    <span class="Li">&quot;suidperl&quot;</span> is neither built nor installed
    by default, and has been deprecated since perl 5.8.0. You are advised to
    replace use of suidperl with tools such as sudo (
    http://www.courtesan.com/sudo/ )</p>
<p class="Pp">We have a backlog of unresolved bugs. Dealing with bugs and bug
    reports is unglamorous work; not something ideally suited to volunteer
    labour, but that is all that we have.</p>
<p class="Pp">The perl5 development team are implementing changes to help
    address this problem, which should go live in early 2004.</p>

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
  posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
  http://bugs.perl.org. There may also be information at http://www.perl.org,
  the Perl Home Page.
<p class="Pp">If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the
    <b>perlbug</b> program included with your release. Be sure to trim your bug
    down to a tiny but sufficient test case. Your bug report, along with the
    output of <span class="Li">&quot;perl -V&quot;</span>, will be sent off to
    perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team. You can browse and
    search the Perl 5 bugs at http://bugs.perl.org/</p>
