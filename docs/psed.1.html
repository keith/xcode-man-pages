<p class="Pp">A stream editor reads the input stream consisting of the specified
    files (or standard input, if none are given), processes is line by line by
    applying a script consisting of edit commands, and writes resulting lines to
    standard output. The filename '<span class="Li">&quot;-&quot;</span>' may be
    used to read standard input.</p>
<p class="Pp">The edit script is composed from arguments of <b>-e</b> options
    and script-files, in the given order. A single script argument may be
    specified as the first parameter.</p>
<p class="Pp">If this program is invoked with the name <i>s2p</i>, it will act
    as a sed-to-Perl translator. See &quot;SED SCRIPT TRANSLATION&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>sed</b> returns an exit code of 0 on success or &gt;0 if an
    error occurred.</p>

<p class="Pp">with whitespace being permitted before or after addresses, and

    the address inverter (<span class="Li">&quot;!&quot;</span>) are used to
    restrict the application of a command to the selected line(s) of input.</p>
<p class="Pp">Each command must be on a line of its own, except where noted in
    the synopses below.</p>
<p class="Pp">The edit cycle performed on each input line consist of reading the
    line (without its trailing newline character) into the <i>pattern space</i>,
    applying the applicable commands of the edit script, writing the final
    contents of the pattern space and a newline to the standard output. A
    <i>hold space</i> is provided for saving the contents of the pattern space
    for later use.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Addresses"><a class="permalink" href="#Addresses">Addresses</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">A sed address is either a line number or a pattern, which may be
    combined arbitrarily to construct ranges. Lines are numbered across all
    input files.</p>
<p class="Pp">Any address may be followed by an exclamation mark
    ('<span class="Li">&quot;!&quot;</span>'), selecting all lines not matching
    that address.</p>

  <dd>A dollar sign (<span class="Li">&quot;$&quot;</span>) is the line number
      of the last line of the input stream.</dd>
  <dt><b>/</b><i>regular expression</i><b>/</b></dt>
  <dd>A pattern address is a basic regular expression (see &quot;BASIC REGULAR
      EXPRESSIONS&quot;), between the delimiting character
      <span class="Li">&quot;/&quot;</span>. Any other character except
      <span class="Li">&quot;\&quot;</span> or newline may be used to delimit a
      pattern address when the initial delimiter is prefixed with a backslash
      ('<span class="Li">&quot;\&quot;</span>').</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">If no address is given, the command selects every line.</p>
<p class="Pp">If one address is given, it selects the line (or lines) matching
    the address.</p>
<p class="Pp">Two addresses select a range that begins whenever the first
    address matches, and ends (including that line) when the second address
    matches. If the first (second) address is a matching pattern, the second
    address is not applied to the very same line to determine the end of the
    range. Likewise, if the second address is a matching pattern, the first
    address is not applied to the very same line to determine the begin of
    another range. If both addresses are line numbers, and the second line
    number is less than the first line number, then only the first line is
    selected.</p>

      pattern space that matches the <i>regular expression</i>. Any character
      other than backslash or newline can be used instead of a slash to delimit
      the regular expression and the replacement. To use the delimiter as a
      literal character within the regular expression and the replacement,
      precede the character by a backslash
      ('<span class="Li">&quot;\&quot;</span>').
    <p class="Pp">Literal newlines may be embedded in the replacement string by

<p class="Pp">A <i>Basic Regular Expression</i> (BRE), as defined in POSIX
    1003.2, consists of <i>atoms</i>, for matching parts of a string, and
    <i>bounds</i>, specifying repetitions of a preceding atom.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Atoms"><a class="permalink" href="#Atoms">Atoms</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The possible atoms of a BRE are: <b>.</b>, matching any single
    character; <b>^</b> and <b>$</b>, matching the null string at the beginning
    or end of a string, respectively; a <i>bracket expressions</i>, enclosed in
    <b>[</b> and <b>]</b> (see below); and any single character with no other
    significance (matching that character). A <b>\</b> before one of: <b>.</b>,
    <b>^</b>, <b>$</b>, <b>[</b>, <b>*</b>, <b>\</b>, matching the character
    after the backslash. A sequence of atoms enclosed in <b>\(</b> and <b>\)</b>
    becomes an atom and establishes the target for a <i>backreference</i>,
    consisting of the substring that actually matches the enclosed atoms.
    Finally, <b>\</b> followed by one of the digits <b>0</b> through <b>9</b> is
    a backreference.</p>
<p class="Pp">A <b>^</b> that is not first, or a <b>$</b> that is not last does
    not have a special significance and need not be preceded by a backslash to
    become literal. The same is true for a <b>]</b>, that does not terminate a
    bracket expression.</p>
<p class="Pp">An unescaped backslash cannot be last in a BRE.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Bounds"><a class="permalink" href="#Bounds">Bounds</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The BRE bounds are: <b>*</b>, specifying 0 or more matches of the
    preceding atom; <b>\{</b><i>count</i><b>\}</b>, specifying that many
    repetitions; <b>\{</b><i>minimum</i><b>,\}</b>, giving a lower limit; and
    <b>\{</b><i>minimum</i><b>,</b><i>maximum</i><b>\}</b> finally defines a
    lower and upper bound.</p>

<p class="Pp">A <i>bracket expression</i> is a list of characters, character
    ranges and character classes enclosed in <b>[</b> and <b>]</b> and matches
    any single character from the represented set of characters.</p>
<p class="Pp">A character range is written as two characters separated by
    <b>-</b> and represents all characters (according to the character collating
    sequence) that are not less than the first and not greater than the second.
    (Ranges are very collating-sequence-dependent, and portable programs should
    avoid relying on them.)</p>

    characters as defined in <i>ctype</i>(3).</p>
<p class="Pp">If the first character after <b>[</b> is <b>^</b>, the sense of
    matching is inverted.</p>
<p class="Pp">To include a literal '<span class="Li">&quot;^&quot;</span>',
    place it anywhere else but first. To include a literal
    '<span class="Li">&quot;]&quot;</span>' place it first or immediately after
    an initial <b>^</b>. To include a literal
    '<span class="Li">&quot;-&quot;</span>' make it the first (or second after
    <b>^</b>) or last character, or the second endpoint of a range.</p>
<p class="Pp">The special bracket expression constructs
    <span class="Li">&quot;[[:&lt;:]]&quot;</span> and

<p class="Pp">If this program is invoked with the name <i>s2p</i> it will act as
    a sed-to-Perl translator. After option processing (all other arguments are
    ignored), a Perl program is printed on standard output, which will process
    the input stream (as read from all arguments) in the way defined by the sed
    script and the option setting used for the translation.</p>

<p class="Pp">The <b>l</b> command will show escape characters (ESC) as
    '<span class="Li">&quot;\e&quot;</span>', but a vertical tab (VT) in
  octal.</p>
<p class="Pp">Trailing spaces are truncated from labels in <b>:</b>, <b>t</b>
    and <b>b</b> commands.</p>
<p class="Pp">The meaning of an empty regular expression
    ('<span class="Li">&quot;//&quot;</span>'), as defined by <b>sed</b>, is
    &quot;the last pattern used, at run time&quot;. This deviates from the Perl
    interpretation, which will re-use the &quot;last last successfully executed
    regular expression&quot;. Since keeping track of pattern usage would create
    terribly cluttered code, and differences would only appear in obscure
    context (where other <b>sed</b> implementations appear to deviate, too), the
    Perl semantics was adopted. Note that common usage of this feature, such as
    in <span class="Li">&quot;/abc/s//xyz/&quot;</span>, will work as
  expected.</p>
<p class="Pp">Collating elements (of bracket expressions in BREs) are not
