<p class="Pp">This package lets you create and manipulate complex numbers. By
    default, <i>Perl</i> limits itself to real numbers, but an extra
    <span class="Li">&quot;use&quot;</span> statement brings full complex
    support, along with a full set of mathematical functions typically
    associated with and/or extended to complex numbers.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you wonder what complex numbers are, they were invented to be
    able to solve the following equation:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        x*x = -1
</pre>
<p class="Pp">and by definition, the solution is noted <i>i</i> (engineers use
    <i>j</i> instead since <i>i</i> usually denotes an intensity, but the name
    does not matter). The number <i>i</i> is a pure <i>imaginary</i> number.</p>
<p class="Pp">The arithmetics with pure imaginary numbers works just like you
    would expect it with real numbers... you just have to remember that</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        i*i = -1
</pre>
<p class="Pp">so you have:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        5i + 7i = i * (5 + 7) = 12i
        4i - 3i = i * (4 - 3) = i
        4i * 2i = -8
        6i / 2i = 3
        1 / i = -i
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Complex numbers are numbers that have both a real part and an
    imaginary part, and are usually noted:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        a + bi
</pre>
<p class="Pp">where <span class="Li">&quot;a&quot;</span> is the <i>real</i>
    part and <span class="Li">&quot;b&quot;</span> is the <i>imaginary</i> part.
    The arithmetic with complex numbers is straightforward. You have to keep
    track of the real and the imaginary parts, but otherwise the rules used for
    real numbers just apply:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        (4 + 3i) + (5 - 2i) = (4 + 5) + i(3 - 2) = 9 + i
        (2 + i) * (4 - i) = 2*4 + 4i -2i -i*i = 8 + 2i + 1 = 9 + 2i
</pre>
<p class="Pp">A graphical representation of complex numbers is possible in a
    plane (also called the <i>complex plane</i>, but it's really a 2D plane).
    The number</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        z = a + bi
</pre>
<p class="Pp">is the point whose coordinates are (a, b). Actually, it would be
    the vector originating from (0, 0) to (a, b). It follows that the addition
    of two complex numbers is a vectorial addition.</p>
<p class="Pp">Since there is a bijection between a point in the 2D plane and a
    complex number (i.e. the mapping is unique and reciprocal), a complex number
    can also be uniquely identified with polar coordinates:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        [rho, theta]
</pre>
<p class="Pp">where <span class="Li">&quot;rho&quot;</span> is the distance to
    the origin, and <span class="Li">&quot;theta&quot;</span> the angle between
    the vector and the <i>x</i> axis. There is a notation for this using the
    exponential form, which is:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        rho * exp(i * theta)
</pre>
<p class="Pp">where <i>i</i> is the famous imaginary number introduced above.
    Conversion between this form and the cartesian form <span class="Li">&quot;a
    + bi&quot;</span> is immediate:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        a = rho * cos(theta)
        b = rho * sin(theta)
</pre>
<p class="Pp">which is also expressed by this formula:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        z = rho * exp(i * theta) = rho * (cos theta + i * sin theta)
</pre>
<p class="Pp">In other words, it's the projection of the vector onto the
    <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> axes. Mathematicians call <i>rho</i> the <i>norm</i>
    or <i>modulus</i> and <i>theta</i> the <i>argument</i> of the complex
    number. The <i>norm</i> of <span class="Li">&quot;z&quot;</span> is marked
    here as <span class="Li">abs(z)</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The polar notation (also known as the trigonometric
    representation) is much more handy for performing multiplications and
    divisions of complex numbers, whilst the cartesian notation is better suited
    for additions and subtractions. Real numbers are on the <i>x</i> axis, and
    therefore <i>y</i> or <i>theta</i> is zero or <i>pi</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">All the common operations that can be performed on a real number
    have been defined to work on complex numbers as well, and are merely
    <i>extensions</i> of the operations defined on real numbers. This means they
    keep their natural meaning when there is no imaginary part, provided the
    number is within their definition set.</p>
<p class="Pp">For instance, the <span class="Li">&quot;sqrt&quot;</span> routine
    which computes the square root of its argument is only defined for
    non-negative real numbers and yields a non-negative real number (it is an
    application from <b>R+</b> to <b>R+</b>). If we allow it to return a complex
    number, then it can be extended to negative real numbers to become an
    application from <b>R</b> to <b>C</b> (the set of complex numbers):</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        sqrt(x) = x &gt;= 0 ? sqrt(x) : sqrt(-x)*i
</pre>
<p class="Pp">It can also be extended to be an application from <b>C</b> to
    <b>C</b>, whilst its restriction to <b>R</b> behaves as defined above by
    using the following definition:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        sqrt(z = [r,t]) = sqrt(r) * exp(i * t/2)
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Indeed, a negative real number can be noted
    <span class="Li">&quot;[x,pi]&quot;</span> (the modulus <i>x</i> is always
    non-negative, so <span class="Li">&quot;[x,pi]&quot;</span> is really
    <span class="Li">&quot;-x&quot;</span>, a negative number) and the above
    definition states that</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        sqrt([x,pi]) = sqrt(x) * exp(i*pi/2) = [sqrt(x),pi/2] = sqrt(x)*i
</pre>
<p class="Pp">which is exactly what we had defined for negative real numbers
    above. The <span class="Li">&quot;sqrt&quot;</span> returns only one of the
    solutions: if you want the both, use the
    <span class="Li">&quot;root&quot;</span> function.</p>
<p class="Pp">All the common mathematical functions defined on real numbers that
    are extended to complex numbers share that same property of working <i>as
    usual</i> when the imaginary part is zero (otherwise, it would not be called
    an extension, would it?).</p>
<p class="Pp">A <i>new</i> operation possible on a complex number that is the
    identity for real numbers is called the <i>conjugate</i>, and is noted with
    a horizontal bar above the number, or <span class="Li">&quot;~z&quot;</span>
    here.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>         z = a + bi
        ~z = a - bi
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Simple... Now look:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        z * ~z = (a + bi) * (a - bi) = a*a + b*b
</pre>
<p class="Pp">We saw that the norm of <span class="Li">&quot;z&quot;</span> was
    noted <span class="Li">abs(z)</span> and was defined as the distance to the
    origin, also known as:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        rho = abs(z) = sqrt(a*a + b*b)
</pre>
<p class="Pp">so</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        z * ~z = abs(z) ** 2
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If z is a pure real number (i.e. <span class="Li">&quot;b ==
    0&quot;</span>), then the above yields:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        a * a = abs(a) ** 2
</pre>
<p class="Pp">which is true (<span class="Li">&quot;abs&quot;</span> has the
    regular meaning for real number, i.e. stands for the absolute value). This
    example explains why the norm of <span class="Li">&quot;z&quot;</span> is
    noted <span class="Li">abs(z)</span>: it extends the
    <span class="Li">&quot;abs&quot;</span> function to complex numbers, yet is
    the regular <span class="Li">&quot;abs&quot;</span> we know when the complex
    number actually has no imaginary part... This justifies <i>a posteriori</i>
    our use of the <span class="Li">&quot;abs&quot;</span> notation for the
    norm.</p>

<p class="Pp">When printed, a complex number is usually shown under its
    cartesian style <i>a+bi</i>, but there are legitimate cases where the polar
    style <i>[r,t]</i> is more appropriate. The process of converting the
    complex number into a string that can be displayed is known as
    <i>stringification</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">By calling the class method
    <span class="Li">&quot;Math::Complex::display_format&quot;</span> and
    supplying either <span class="Li">&quot;polar&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;cartesian&quot;</span> as an argument, you override
    the default display style, which is
    <span class="Li">&quot;cartesian&quot;</span>. Not supplying any argument
    returns the current settings.</p>
<p class="Pp">This default can be overridden on a per-number basis by calling
    the <span class="Li">&quot;display_format&quot;</span> method instead. As
    before, not supplying any argument returns the current display style for
    this number. Otherwise whatever you specify will be the new display style
    for <i>this</i> particular number.</p>
<p class="Pp">For instance:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        use Math::Complex;
        Math::Complex::display_format('polar');
        $j = (root(1, 3))[1];
        print &quot;j = $j\n&quot;;               # Prints &quot;j = [1,2pi/3]&quot;
        $j-&gt;display_format('cartesian');
        print &quot;j = $j\n&quot;;               # Prints &quot;j = -0.5+0.866025403784439i&quot;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The polar style attempts to emphasize arguments like <i>k*pi/n</i>
    (where <i>n</i> is a positive integer and <i>k</i> an integer within [-9,
    +9]), this is called <i>polar pretty-printing</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">For the reverse of stringifying, see the

<p class="Pp">Saying <span class="Li">&quot;use Math::Complex;&quot;</span>
    exports many mathematical routines in the caller environment and even
    overrides some (<span class="Li">&quot;sqrt&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;log&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;atan2&quot;</span>). This is construed as a feature
    by the Authors, actually... ;-)</p>
<p class="Pp">All routines expect to be given real or complex numbers. Don't
    attempt to use BigFloat, since Perl has currently no rule to disambiguate a
    '+' operation (for instance) between two overloaded entities.</p>
<p class="Pp">In Cray UNICOS there is some strange numerical instability that
    results in <b>root()</b>, <b>cos()</b>, <b>sin()</b>, <b>cosh()</b>,
    <b>sinh()</b>, losing accuracy fast. Beware. The bug may be in UNICOS math
    libs, in UNICOS C compiler, in Math::Complex. Whatever it is, it does not
    manifest itself anywhere else where Perl runs.</p>
