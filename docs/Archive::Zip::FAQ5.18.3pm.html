<p class="Pp">It seems that I keep answering the same questions over and over
    again. I assume that this is because my documentation is deficient, rather
    than that people don't read the documentation.</p>
<p class="Pp">So this FAQ is an attempt to cut down on the number of personal
    answers I have to give. At least I can now say &quot;You <i>did</i> read the
    FAQ, right?&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">The questions are not in any particular order. The answers assume
    the current version of Archive::Zip; some of the answers depend on newly
    added/fixed functionality.</p>

<p class="Pp"><b>Q:</b> Archive::Zip won't install on my RedHat 9 system! It's
    broke!</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>A:</b> This has become something of a FAQ. Basically, RedHat
    broke some versions of Perl by setting LANG to UTF8. They apparently have a
    fixed version out as an update.</p>

  <dt id="Don't"><a class="permalink" href="#Don't">Don't make lots of little

  <dd>Since zip computes the compression tables for each member, small members
      without much entropy won't compress well. Instead, if you've got lots of
      repeated strings in your data, try to combine them into one big
    member.</dd>

  Read/modify/write same Zip file</a></h1>
<p class="Pp"><b>Q:</b> Why can't I open a Zip file, add a member, and write it
    back? I get an error message when I try.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>A:</b> Because Archive::Zip doesn't (and can't, generally) read
    file contents into memory, the original Zip file is required to stay around
    until the writing of the new file is completed.</p>
<p class="Pp">The best way to do this is to write the Zip to a temporary file
    and then rename the temporary file to have the old name (possibly after
    deleting the old one).</p>
<p class="Pp">Archive::Zip v1.02 added the archive methods
    <span class="Li">&quot;overwrite()&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;overwriteAs()&quot;</span> to do this simply and
    carefully.</p>
<p class="Pp">See <span class="Li">&quot;examples/updateZip.pl&quot;</span> for

<p class="Pp"><b>Q:</b> Upon extracting files, I see that their modification
    (and access) times are set to the time in the Zip archive. However, their
    creation time is not set to the same time. Why?</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>A:</b> Mostly because Perl doesn't give cross-platform access
    to <i>creation time</i>. Indeed, many systems (like Unix) don't support such
    a concept. However, if yours does, you can easily set it. Get the
    modification time from the member using
    <span class="Li">&quot;lastModTime()&quot;</span>.</p>

<p class="Pp"><b>Q:</b> Can I use Archive::Zip to extract Unix gzip files?</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>A:</b> No.</p>
<p class="Pp">There is a distinction between Unix gzip files, and Zip archives
    that also can use the gzip compression.</p>
<p class="Pp">Depending on the format of the gzip file, you can use
    Compress::Raw::Zlib, or Archive::Tar to decompress it (and de-archive it in
    the case of Tar files).</p>
<p class="Pp">You can unzip PKZIP/WinZip/etc/ archives using Archive::Zip
    (that's what it's for) as long as any compressed members are compressed
    using Deflate compression.</p>

<p class="Pp"><b>Q:</b> It bothers me greatly that my file times are wrong by
    one second about half the time. Why don't you do something about it?</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>A:</b> Get over it. This is a result of the Zip format storing
    times in DOS format, which has a resolution of only two seconds.</p>

<p class="Pp"><b>Q:</b> I want to make a self-extracting Zip file. Can I do
    this?</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>A:</b> Yes. You can write a self-extracting archive stub (that
    is, a version of unzip) to the output filehandle that you pass to
    <i>writeToFileHandle()</i>. See examples/selfex.pl for how to write a
    self-extracting archive.</p>
<p class="Pp">However, you should understand that this will only work on one
    kind of platform (the one for which the stub was compiled).</p>

<p class="Pp"><b>Q:</b> How can I tell if a Zip has been damaged by adding
    garbage to the beginning or inside the file?</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>A:</b> I added code for this for the Amavis virus scanner. You
    can query archives for their 'eocdOffset' property, which should be 0:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  if ($zip-&gt;eocdOffset &gt; 0)
    { warn($zip-&gt;eocdOffset . &quot; bytes of garbage at beginning or within Zip&quot;) }

<p class="Pp"><b>Q:</b> I'm trying to extract a file out of a Zip produced by
    PKZIP, and keep getting this error message:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  error: Unsupported compression combination: read 6, write 0
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><b>A:</b> You can't uncompress this archive member. Archive::Zip
    only supports uncompressed members, and compressed members that are
    compressed using the compression supported by Compress::Raw::Zlib. That
    means only Deflated and Stored members.</p>
<p class="Pp">Your file is compressed using the Shrink format, which is not
    supported by Compress::Raw::Zlib.</p>
<p class="Pp">You could, perhaps, use a command-line UnZip program (like the
    Info-Zip one) to extract this.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="How_to_test_file_integrity?"><a class="permalink" href="#How_to_test_file_integrity?">How
  to test file integrity?</a></h1>
<p class="Pp"><b>Q:</b> How can Archive::Zip can test the validity of a Zip
    file?</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>A:</b> If you try to decompress the file, the gzip streams will
    report errors if you have garbage. Most of the time.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you try to open the file and a central directory structure
    can't be found, an error will be reported.</p>
<p class="Pp">When a file is being read, if we can't find a proper PK..
    signature in the right places we report a format error.</p>
<p class="Pp">If there is added garbage at the beginning of a Zip file (as
    inserted by some viruses), you can find out about it, but Archive::Zip will
    ignore it, and you can still use the archive. When it gets written back out
    the added stuff will be gone.</p>
<p class="Pp">There are two ready-to-use utilities in the examples directory
    that can be used to test file integrity, or that you can use as examples for
    your own code:</p>

<p class="Pp"><b>Q:</b> Archive::Zip let me put the same file in my Zip twice!
    Why don't you prevent this?</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>A:</b> As far as I can tell, this is not disallowed by the Zip
    spec. If you think it's a bad idea, check for it yourself:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  $zip-&gt;addFile($someFile, $someName) unless $zip-&gt;memberNamed($someName);

<p class="Pp"><b>Q:</b> Why doesn't Archive::Zip deal with file ownership, ACLs,
    etc.?</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>A:</b> There is no standard way to represent these in the Zip

    extra fields that have been used to represent these through the years, I'll

<p class="Pp"><b>Q:</b> I've only installed modules using ActiveState's PPM
    program and repository. But they have a much older version of Archive::Zip
    than is in CPAN. Will you send me a newer PPM?</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>A:</b> Probably not, unless I get lots of extra time. But
    there's no reason you can't install the version from CPAN. Archive::Zip is
    pure Perl, so all you need is NMAKE, which you can get for free from
    Microsoft (see the FAQ in the ActiveState documentation for details on how
