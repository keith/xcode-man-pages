  I get a BNF/yacc/RE for the Perl language?</a></h2>
There is no BNF, but you can paw your way through the yacc grammar in perly.y in
  the source distribution if you're particularly brave. The grammar relies on
  very smart tokenizing code, so be prepared to venture into toke.c as well.
<p class="Pp">In the words of Chaim Frenkel: &quot;Perl's grammar can not be
    reduced to BNF. The work of parsing perl is distributed between yacc, the
    lexer, smoke and mirrors.&quot;</p>

  are all these $@%&amp;* punctuation signs, and how do I know when to use
  them?</a></h2>
They are type specifiers, as detailed in perldata:
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    $ for scalar values (number, string or reference)
    @ for arrays
    % for hashes (associative arrays)
    &amp; for subroutines (aka functions, procedures, methods)
    * for all types of that symbol name. In version 4 you used them like
      pointers, but in modern perls you can just use references.
</pre>
<p class="Pp">There are a couple of other symbols that you're likely to
    encounter that aren't really type specifiers:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    &lt;&gt; are used for inputting a record from a filehandle.
    \  takes a reference to something.
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Note that &lt;FILE&gt; is <i>neither</i> the type specifier for
    files nor the name of the handle. It is the
    <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;&gt;&quot;</span> operator applied to the handle
    FILE. It reads one line (well, record--see &quot;$/&quot; in perlvar) from
    the handle FILE in scalar context, or <i>all</i> lines in list context. When
    performing open, close, or any other operation besides
    <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;&gt;&quot;</span> on files, or even when talking
    about the handle, do <i>not</i> use the brackets. These are correct:
    <span class="Li">&quot;eof(FH)&quot;</span>, <span class="Li">&quot;seek(FH,
    0,</span> <span class="Li">2)&quot;</span> and &quot;copying from STDIN to
    FILE&quot;.</p>

  I always/never have to quote my strings or use semicolons and commas?</a></h2>
Normally, a bareword doesn't need to be quoted, but in most cases probably
  should be (and must be under <span class="Li">&quot;use strict&quot;</span>).
  But a hash key consisting of a simple word and the left-hand operand to the
  <span class="Li">&quot;=&gt;&quot;</span> operator both count as though they
  were quoted:
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    This                    is like this
    ------------            ---------------
    $foo{line}              $foo{'line'}
    bar =&gt; stuff            'bar' =&gt; stuff
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The final semicolon in a block is optional, as is the final comma
    in a list. Good style (see perlstyle) says to put them in except for
    one-liners:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    if ($whoops) { exit 1 }
    my @nums = (1, 2, 3);

    if ($whoops) {
        exit 1;
    }

    my @lines = (
        &quot;There Beren came from mountains cold&quot;,
        &quot;And lost he wandered under leaves&quot;,

One way is to treat the return values as a list and index into it:
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    $dir = (getpwnam($user))[7];
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Another way is to use undef as an element on the

<pre>
    ($dev, $ino, undef, undef, $uid, $gid) = stat($file);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">You can also use a list slice to select only the elements that you
    need:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>

If you are running Perl 5.6.0 or better, the <span class="Li">&quot;use
  warnings&quot;</span> pragma allows fine control of what warnings are
  produced. See perllexwarn for more details.
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    {
        no warnings;          # temporarily turn off warnings
        $x = $y + $z;         # I know these might be undef
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Additionally, you can enable and disable categories of warnings.
    You turn off the categories you want to ignore and you can still get other
    categories of warnings. See perllexwarn for the complete details, including
    the category names and hierarchy.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    {
        no warnings 'uninitialized';
        $x = $y + $z;
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If you have an older version of Perl, the
    <span class="Li">$^W</span> variable (documented in perlvar) controls
    runtime warnings for a block:</p>

<pre>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Why_do_Perl_operators_have_different_precedence_than_C_operators?"><a class="permalink" href="#Why_do_Perl_operators_have_different_precedence_than_C_operators?">Why
  do Perl operators have different precedence than C operators?</a></h2>
Actually, they don't. All C operators that Perl copies have the same precedence
  in Perl as they do in C. The problem is with operators that C doesn't have,
  especially functions that give a list context to everything on their right,
  eg. print, chmod, exec, and so on. Such functions are called &quot;list
  operators&quot; and appear as such in the precedence table in perlop.
<p class="Pp">A common mistake is to write:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    unlink $file || die &quot;snafu&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This gets interpreted as:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    unlink ($file || die &quot;snafu&quot;);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">To avoid this problem, either put in extra parentheses or use the
    super low precedence <span class="Li">&quot;or&quot;</span> operator:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    (unlink $file) || die &quot;snafu&quot;;
    unlink $file or die &quot;snafu&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The &quot;English&quot; operators
    (<span class="Li">&quot;and&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;or&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;xor&quot;</span>, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;not&quot;</span>) deliberately have precedence lower
    than that of list operators for just such situations as the one above.</p>
<p class="Pp">Another operator with surprising precedence is exponentiation. It
    binds more tightly even than unary minus, making
    <span class="Li">&quot;-2**2&quot;</span> produce a negative four and not a
    positive one. It is also right-associating, meaning that
    <span class="Li">&quot;2**3**2&quot;</span> is two raised to the ninth
    power, not eight squared.</p>
<p class="Pp">Although it has the same precedence as in C, Perl's
    <span class="Li">&quot;?:&quot;</span> operator produces an lvalue. This
    assigns <span class="Li">$x</span> to either
    <span class="Li">$if_true</span> or <span class="Li">$if_false</span>,
    depending on the trueness of <span class="Li">$maybe:</span></p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    ($maybe ? $if_true : $if_false) = $x;

In general, you don't &quot;declare&quot; a structure. Just use a (probably
  anonymous) hash reference. See perlref and perldsc for details. Here's an
  example:
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    $person = {};                   # new anonymous hash
    $person-&gt;{AGE}  = 24;           # set field AGE to 24
    $person-&gt;{NAME} = &quot;Nat&quot;;        # set field NAME to &quot;Nat&quot;

<h2 class="Ss" id="How_do_I_create_a_module?"><a class="permalink" href="#How_do_I_create_a_module?">How

perlnewmod is a good place to start, ignore the bits about uploading to CPAN if
  you don't want to make your module publicly available.
<p class="Pp">ExtUtils::ModuleMaker and Module::Starter are also good places to
    start. Many CPAN authors now use Dist::Zilla to automate as much as
    possible.</p>
<p class="Pp">Detailed documentation about modules can be found at: perlmod,
    perlmodlib, perlmodstyle.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you need to include C code or C library interfaces use h2xs.
    h2xs will create the module distribution structure and the initial interface
    files. perlxs and perlxstut explain the details.</p>

(contributed by brian d foy)
<p class="Pp">In Perl, a class is just a package, and methods are just
    subroutines. Perl doesn't get more formal than that and lets you set up the
    package just the way that you like it (that is, it doesn't set up anything
    for you).</p>

You can use the <b>tainted()</b> function of the Scalar::Util module, available
  from CPAN (or included with Perl since release 5.8.0). See also
  &quot;Laundering and Detecting Tainted Data&quot; in perlsec.

<h2 class="Ss" id="What's_a_closure?"><a class="permalink" href="#What's_a_closure?">What's
  a closure?</a></h2>
Closures are documented in perlref.
<p class="Pp"><i>Closure</i> is a computer science term with a precise but
    hard-to-explain meaning. Usually, closures are implemented in Perl as
    anonymous subroutines with lasting references to lexical variables outside
    their own scopes. These lexicals magically refer to the variables that were
    around when the subroutine was defined (deep binding).</p>
<p class="Pp">Closures are most often used in programming languages where you
    can have the return value of a function be itself a function, as you can in
    Perl. Note that some languages provide anonymous functions but are not
    capable of providing proper closures: the Python language, for example. For
    more information on closures, check out any textbook on functional
    programming. Scheme is a language that not only supports but encourages
    closures.</p>
<p class="Pp">Here's a classic non-closure function-generating function:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    sub add_function_generator {
        return sub { shift() + shift() };
    }

    my $add_sub = add_function_generator();
    my $sum = $add_sub-&gt;(4,5);                # $sum is 9 now.
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The anonymous subroutine returned by
    <b>add_function_generator()</b> isn't technically a closure because it
    refers to no lexicals outside its own scope. Using a closure gives you a
    <i>function template</i> with some customization slots left out to be filled
    later.</p>
<p class="Pp">Contrast this with the following <b>make_adder()</b> function, in
    which the returned anonymous function contains a reference to a lexical
    variable outside the scope of that function itself. Such a reference
    requires that Perl return a proper closure, thus locking in for all time the
    value that the lexical had when the function was created.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    sub make_adder {
        my $addpiece = shift;
        return sub { shift() + $addpiece };
    }

    my $f1 = make_adder(20);
    my $f2 = make_adder(555);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Now <span class="Li">&quot;$f1-&gt;($n)&quot;</span> is always 20
    plus whatever <span class="Li">$n</span> you pass in, whereas
    <span class="Li">&quot;$f2-&gt;($n)&quot;</span> is always 555 plus whatever
    <span class="Li">$n</span> you pass in. The
    <span class="Li">$addpiece</span> in the closure sticks around.</p>
<p class="Pp">Closures are often used for less esoteric purposes. For example,
    when you want to pass in a bit of code into a function:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    my $line;
    timeout( 30, sub { $line = &lt;STDIN&gt; } );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If the code to execute had been passed in as a string,
    <span class="Li">'$line = &lt;STDIN&gt;'</span>, there would have been no
    way for the hypothetical <b>timeout()</b> function to access the lexical
    variable <span class="Li">$line</span> back in its caller's scope.</p>
<p class="Pp">Another use for a closure is to make a variable <i>private</i> to
    a named subroutine, e.g. a counter that gets initialized at creation time of
    the sub and can only be modified from within the sub. This is sometimes used
    with a BEGIN block in package files to make sure a variable doesn't get
    meddled with during the lifetime of the package:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    BEGIN {
        my $id = 0;
        sub next_id { ++$id }
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This is discussed in more detail in perlsub; see the entry on
    <i>Persistent Private Variables</i>.</p>

  is variable suicide and how can I prevent it?</a></h2>
This problem was fixed in perl 5.004_05, so preventing it means upgrading your
  version of perl. ;)
<p class="Pp">Variable suicide is when you (temporarily or permanently) lose the
    value of a variable. It is caused by scoping through <b>my()</b> and
    <b>local()</b> interacting with either closures or aliased <b>foreach()</b>
    iterator variables and subroutine arguments. It used to be easy to
    inadvertently lose a variable's value this way, but now it's much harder.
    Take this code:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    my $f = 'foo';
    sub T {
        while ($i++ &lt; 3) { my $f = $f; $f .= &quot;bar&quot;; print $f, &quot;\n&quot; }
    }

    T;
    print &quot;Finally $f\n&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If you are experiencing variable suicide, that
    <span class="Li">&quot;my $f&quot;</span> in the subroutine doesn't pick up
    a fresh copy of the <span class="Li">$f</span> whose value is
    <span class="Li">'foo'</span>. The output shows that inside the subroutine
    the value of <span class="Li">$f</span> leaks through when it shouldn't, as
    in this output:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    foobar
    foobarbar
    foobarbarbar
    Finally foo
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">$f</span> that has &quot;bar&quot; added to
    it three times should be a new <span class="Li">$f</span>
    <span class="Li">&quot;my $f&quot;</span> should create a new lexical
    variable each time through the loop. The expected output is:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    foobar
    foobar
    foobar
    Finally foo
</pre>

<h2 class="Ss" id="How_do_I_create_a_static_variable?"><a class="permalink" href="#How_do_I_create_a_static_variable?">How
  do I create a static variable?</a></h2>
(contributed by brian d foy)
<p class="Pp">In Perl 5.10, declare the variable with
    <span class="Li">&quot;state&quot;</span>. The
    <span class="Li">&quot;state&quot;</span> declaration creates the lexical
    variable that persists between calls to the subroutine:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    sub counter { state $count = 1; $count++ }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">You can fake a static variable by using a lexical variable which
    goes out of scope. In this example, you define the subroutine
    <span class="Li">&quot;counter&quot;</span>, and it uses the lexical
    variable <span class="Li">$count</span>. Since you wrap this in a BEGIN
    block, <span class="Li">$count</span> is defined at compile-time, but also
    goes out of scope at the end of the BEGIN block. The BEGIN block also
    ensures that the subroutine and the value it uses is defined at compile-time
    so the subroutine is ready to use just like any other subroutine, and you
    can put this code in the same place as other subroutines in the program text
    (i.e. at the end of the code, typically). The subroutine
    <span class="Li">&quot;counter&quot;</span> still has a reference to the
    data, and is the only way you can access the value (and each time you do,
    you increment the value). The data in chunk of memory defined by
    <span class="Li">$count</span> is private to
    <span class="Li">&quot;counter&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    BEGIN {
        my $count = 1;
        sub counter { $count++ }
    }

    my $start = counter();

    .... # code that calls counter();

    my $end = counter();
</pre>
<p class="Pp">In the previous example, you created a function-private variable
    because only one function remembered its reference. You could define
    multiple functions while the variable is in scope, and each function can
    share the &quot;private&quot; variable. It's not really &quot;static&quot;
    because you can access it outside the function while the lexical variable is
    in scope, and even create references to it. In this example,
    <span class="Li">&quot;increment_count&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;return_count&quot;</span> share the variable. One
    function adds to the value and the other simply returns the value. They can
    both access <span class="Li">$count</span>, and since it has gone out of
    scope, there is no other way to access it.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    BEGIN {
        my $count = 1;
        sub increment_count { $count++ }
        sub return_count    { $count }
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">To declare a file-private variable, you still use a lexical
    variable. A file is also a scope, so a lexical variable defined in the file
    cannot be seen from any other file.</p>
<p class="Pp">See &quot;Persistent Private Variables&quot; in perlsub for more
    information. The discussion of closures in perlref may help you even though
    we did not use anonymous subroutines in this answer. See &quot;Persistent
    Private Variables&quot; in perlsub for details.</p>

  package variables or dynamic variables.
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;my($x)&quot;</span> creates a new variable
    that is only visible in the current subroutine. This is done at
    compile-time, so it is called lexical or static scoping. <b>my()</b> always

    static(ly scoped) variables.</p>
<p class="Pp">For instance:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    sub visible {
        print &quot;var has value $var\n&quot;;

    sub dynamic {

    $var = 'global';

    visible();              # prints global
    dynamic();              # prints local
    lexical();              # prints global
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Notice how at no point does the value &quot;private&quot; get

    called subroutine.</p>
<p class="Pp">In summary, <b>local()</b> doesn't make what you think of as

  the difference between deep and shallow binding?</a></h2>
In deep binding, lexical variables mentioned in anonymous subroutines are the
  same ones that were in scope when the subroutine was created. In shallow
  binding, they are whichever variables with the same names happen to be in
  scope when the subroutine is called. Perl always uses deep binding of lexical
  variables (i.e., those created with <b>my()</b>). However, dynamic variables
  (aka global, local, or package variables) are effectively shallowly bound.
  Consider this just one more reason not to use them. See the answer to
  &quot;What's a closure?&quot;.

<span class="Li">&quot;my()&quot;</span> and
  <span class="Li">&quot;local()&quot;</span> give list context to the right
  hand side of <span class="Li">&quot;=&quot;</span>. The &lt;$fh&gt; read
  operation, like so many of Perl's functions and operators, can tell which
  context it was called in and behaves appropriately. In general, the
  <b>scalar()</b> function can help. This function does nothing to the data
  itself (contrary to popular myth) but rather tells its argument to behave in
  whatever its scalar fashion is. If that function doesn't have a defined scalar
  behavior, this of course doesn't help you (such as with <b>sort()</b>).
<p class="Pp">To enforce scalar context in this particular case, however, you
    need merely omit the parentheses:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    local($foo) = &lt;$fh&gt;;        # WRONG
    local($foo) = scalar(&lt;$fh&gt;);   # ok
    local $foo  = &lt;$fh&gt;;        # right

<p class="Pp">You should probably be using lexical variables anyway, although
    the issue is the same here:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>

<p class="Pp">Calling a subroutine as <span class="Li">&amp;foo</span> with no
    trailing parentheses ignores the prototype of
    <span class="Li">&quot;foo&quot;</span> and passes it the current value of
    the argument list, <span class="Li">@_</span>. Here's an example; the
    <span class="Li">&quot;bar&quot;</span> subroutine calls
    <span class="Li">&amp;foo</span>, which prints its arguments list:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    sub foo { print &quot;Args in foo are: @_\n&quot;; }

    sub bar { &amp;foo; }

    bar( &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot; );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">When you call <span class="Li">&quot;bar&quot;</span> with
    arguments, you see that <span class="Li">&quot;foo&quot;</span> got the same
    <span class="Li">@_</span>:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    Args in foo are: a b c
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Calling the subroutine with trailing parentheses, with or without
    arguments, does not use the current <span class="Li">@_</span>. Changing the
    example to put parentheses after the call to
    <span class="Li">&quot;foo&quot;</span> changes the program:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    sub foo { print &quot;Args in foo are: @_\n&quot;; }

    sub bar { &amp;foo(); }

    bar( &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot; );

<p class="Pp">Now the output shows that <span class="Li">&quot;foo&quot;</span>
    doesn't get the <span class="Li">@_</span> from its caller.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    Args in foo are:
</pre>
<p class="Pp">However, using <span class="Li">&quot;&amp;&quot;</span> in the
    call still overrides the prototype of
    <span class="Li">&quot;foo&quot;</span> if present:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    sub foo ($$$) { print &quot;Args infoo are: @_\n&quot;; }

    sub bar_1 { &amp;foo; }
    sub bar_2 { &amp;foo(); }
    sub bar_3 { foo( $_[0], $_[1], $_[2] ); }
    # sub bar_4 { foo(); }
    # bar_4 doesn't compile: &quot;Not enough arguments for main::foo at ...&quot;

    bar_1( &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot; );
    # Args in foo are: a b c

Some possible reasons: your inheritance is getting confused, you've misspelled

  <span class="Li">&quot;print ref($object)&quot;</span> to find out the class

<p class="Pp">Another possible reason for problems is that you've used the

    &quot;Samy&quot;&quot;</span>) on a class name before Perl has seen that
    such a package exists. It's wisest to make sure your packages are all
    defined before you start using them, which will be taken care of if you use
    the <span class="Li">&quot;use&quot;</span> statement instead of
    <span class="Li">&quot;require&quot;</span>. If not, make sure to use arrow

    <span class="Li">&quot;Guru-&gt;find(&quot;Samy&quot;)&quot;</span>)
    instead. Object notation is explained in perlobj.</p>

    <span class="Li">&quot;caller&quot;</span> built-in:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    sub foo {
        my @args = ...;
        my( $package, $filename, $line ) = caller;

        print &quot;I was called from package $package\n&quot;;
        );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">By default, your program starts in package
    <span class="Li">&quot;main&quot;</span>, so you will always be in some
    package.</p>
<p class="Pp">This is different from finding out the package an object is
    blessed into, which might not be the current package. For that, use
    <span class="Li">&quot;blessed&quot;</span> from Scalar::Util, part of the
    Standard Library since Perl 5.8:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    use Scalar::Util qw(blessed);
    my $object_package = blessed( $object );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Most of the time, you shouldn't care what package an object is
    blessed into, however, as long as it claims to inherit from that class:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    my $is_right_class = eval { $object-&gt;isa( $package ) }; # true or false
</pre>
<p class="Pp">And, with Perl 5.10 and later, you don't have to check for an
    inheritance to see if the object can handle a role. For that, you can use
    <span class="Li">&quot;DOES&quot;</span>, which comes from
    <span class="Li">&quot;UNIVERSAL&quot;</span>:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    my $class_does_it = eval { $object-&gt;DOES( $role ) }; # true or false
</pre>
<p class="Pp">You can safely replace <span class="Li">&quot;isa&quot;</span>
    with <span class="Li">&quot;DOES&quot;</span> (although the converse is not
    true).</p>

  can I comment out a large block of Perl code?</a></h2>
(contributed by brian d foy)
<p class="Pp">The quick-and-dirty way to comment out more than one line of Perl
    is to surround those lines with Pod directives. You have to put these
    directives at the beginning of the line and somewhere where Perl expects a
    new statement (so not in the middle of statements like the
    <span class="Li">&quot;#&quot;</span> comments). You end the comment with
    <span class="Li">&quot;=cut&quot;</span>, ending the Pod section:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    =pod

    my $object = NotGonnaHappen-&gt;new();

    ignored_sub();

    $wont_be_assigned = 37;

    =cut
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The quick-and-dirty method only works well when you don't plan to
    leave the commented code in the source. If a Pod parser comes along, your
    multiline comment is going to show up in the Pod translation. A better way
    hides it from Pod parsers as well.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;=begin&quot;</span> directive can mark
    a section for a particular purpose. If the Pod parser doesn't want to handle
    it, it just ignores it. Label the comments with
    <span class="Li">&quot;comment&quot;</span>. End the comment using
    <span class="Li">&quot;=end&quot;</span> with the same label. You still need
    the <span class="Li">&quot;=cut&quot;</span> to go back to Perl code from
    the Pod comment:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    =begin comment

    my $object = NotGonnaHappen-&gt;new();

    ignored_sub();

    $wont_be_assigned = 37;

    =end comment

    =cut
</pre>

  can I use a variable as a variable name?</a></h2>
Beginners often think they want to have a variable contain the name of a
  variable.
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    $fred    = 23;
    $varname = &quot;fred&quot;;
    ++$$varname;         # $fred now 24
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This works <i>sometimes</i>, but it is a very bad idea for two
    reasons.</p>
<p class="Pp">The first reason is that this technique <i>only works on
    global</i> <i>variables</i>. That means that if
    <span class="Li">$fred</span> is a lexical variable created with <b>my()</b>
    in the above example, the code wouldn't work at all: you'd accidentally
    access the global and skip right over the private lexical altogether. Global
    variables are bad because they can easily collide accidentally and in
    general make for non-scalable and confusing code.</p>
<p class="Pp">Symbolic references are forbidden under the
    <span class="Li">&quot;use strict&quot;</span> pragma. They are not true
    references and consequently are not reference-counted or
  garbage-collected.</p>
<p class="Pp">The other reason why using a variable to hold the name of another
    variable is a bad idea is that the question often stems from a lack of
    understanding of Perl data structures, particularly hashes. By using
    symbolic references, you are just using the package's symbol-table hash
    (like <span class="Li">%main::</span>) instead of a user-defined hash. The
    solution is to use your own hash or a real reference instead.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    $USER_VARS{&quot;fred&quot;} = 23;
    my $varname = &quot;fred&quot;;
    $USER_VARS{$varname}++;  # not $$varname++
</pre>
<p class="Pp">There we're using the <span class="Li">%USER_VARS</span> hash
    instead of symbolic references. Sometimes this comes up in reading strings
    from the user with variable references and wanting to expand them to the
    values of your perl program's variables. This is also a bad idea because it
    conflates the program-addressable namespace and the user-addressable one.
    Instead of reading a string and expanding it to the actual contents of your
    program's own variables:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    $str = 'this has a $fred and $barney in it';
    $str =~ s/(\$\w+)/$1/eeg;          # need double eval
</pre>
<p class="Pp">it would be better to keep a hash around like
    <span class="Li">%USER_VARS</span> and have variable references actually
    refer to entries in that hash:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    $str =~ s/\$(\w+)/$USER_VARS{$1}/g;   # no /e here at all
</pre>
<p class="Pp">That's faster, cleaner, and safer than the previous approach. Of
    course, you don't need to use a dollar sign. You could use your own scheme
    to make it less confusing, like bracketed percent symbols, etc.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    $str = 'this has a %fred% and %barney% in it';
    $str =~ s/%(\w+)%/$USER_VARS{$1}/g;   # no /e here at all
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Another reason that folks sometimes think they want a variable to
    contain the name of a variable is that they don't know how to build proper
    data structures using hashes. For example, let's say they wanted two hashes
    in their program: <span class="Li">%fred</span> and
    <span class="Li">%barney</span>, and that they wanted to use another scalar
    variable to refer to those by name.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    $name = &quot;fred&quot;;
    $$name{WIFE} = &quot;wilma&quot;;     # set %fred

    $name = &quot;barney&quot;;
    $$name{WIFE} = &quot;betty&quot;;    # set %barney
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This is still a symbolic reference, and is still saddled with the
    problems enumerated above. It would be far better to write:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    $folks{&quot;fred&quot;}{WIFE}   = &quot;wilma&quot;;
    $folks{&quot;barney&quot;}{WIFE} = &quot;betty&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">And just use a multilevel hash to start with.</p>
<p class="Pp">The only times that you absolutely <i>must</i> use symbolic
    references are when you really must refer to the symbol table. This may be
    because it's something that one can't take a real reference to, such as a
    format name. Doing so may also be important for method calls, since these
    always go through the symbol table for resolution.</p>
<p class="Pp">In those cases, you would turn off <span class="Li">&quot;strict
    'refs'&quot;</span> temporarily so you can play around with the symbol
    table. For example:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    @colors = qw(red blue green yellow orange purple violet);
    for my $name (@colors) {
        no strict 'refs';  # renege for the block
        *$name = sub { &quot;&lt;FONT COLOR='$name'&gt;@_&lt;/FONT&gt;&quot; };
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">All those functions (<b>red()</b>, <b>blue()</b>, <b>green()</b>,
    etc.) appear to be separate, but the real code in the closure actually was
    compiled only once.</p>
<p class="Pp">So, sometimes you might want to use symbolic references to
    manipulate the symbol table directly. This doesn't matter for formats,
    handles, and subroutines, because they are always global--you can't use
    <b>my()</b> on them. For scalars, arrays, and hashes, though--and usually
    for subroutines-- you probably only want to use hard references.</p>

  does &quot;bad interpreter&quot; mean?</a></h2>
(contributed by brian d foy)
<p class="Pp">The &quot;bad interpreter&quot; message comes from the shell, not
    perl. The actual message may vary depending on your platform, shell, and
    locale settings.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you see &quot;bad interpreter - no such file or
    directory&quot;, the first line in your perl script (the &quot;shebang&quot;
    line) does not contain the right path to perl (or any other program capable
    of running scripts). Sometimes this happens when you move the script from
    one machine to another and each machine has a different path to
    perl--/usr/bin/perl versus /usr/local/bin/perl for instance. It may also
    indicate that the source machine has CRLF line terminators and the
    destination machine has LF only: the shell tries to find
    /usr/bin/perl&lt;CR&gt;, but can't.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you see &quot;bad interpreter: Permission denied&quot;, you
    need to make your script executable.</p>
<p class="Pp">In either case, you should still be able to run the scripts with
    perl explicitly:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    % perl script.pl
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If you get a message like &quot;perl: command not found&quot;,
    perl is not in your PATH, which might also mean that the location of perl is
    not where you expect it so you need to adjust your shebang line.</p>
