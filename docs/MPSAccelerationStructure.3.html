<h2 class="Ss">- (void) encodeRefitToCommandBuffer: (nonnull id&lt;
  MTLCommandBuffer &gt;) commandBuffer</h2>
<p class="Pp">Refit the existing acceleration structure to new data. This method
    is used to refit the acceleration structure to new vertex data, index data,
    instance data, etc. while preserving the existing acceleration structure
    topology. This is typically much faster than a full rebuild of the
    acceleration structure. Refitting can also be pipelined with other GPU work
    such as ray intersection.</p>
<p class="Pp">Until the command buffer has completed, the acceleration structure
    cannot be copied, encoded with <b>NSSecureCoding</b>, or rebuilt. Changes to
    properties such as the triangle count or instance might not be reflected.
    These changes require that the acceleration structure be rebuilt instead.
    The acceleration structure must be rebuilt at least once before this method
    can be called.</p>

    a triangle acceleration structure) have been modified significantly and must
    be rebuilt when properties such as triangle count, vertex stride, etc. have

<p class="Pp">This method blocks until the acceleration structure has been
