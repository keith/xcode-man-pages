      current_version value will be used in the process whenever a framework
      with that install name is required. This is similar to DYLD_FRAMEWORK_PATH
      except instead of always overriding, it only overrides if the supplied
      framework is newer. Note: dyld does not check the framework's Info.plist

  <dd>If set to the leaf name of a mach-o image, dyld prints why that image was
      loaded, including the chain of links from the main executable or

      actual leaf file/install name (e.g. &quot;libz.1.dylib&quot; and not one
      of the aliases such as &quot;libz.dylib&quot;). When reporting the chain
      of links the --&gt; may contain a letter (-w-&gt; is a weak link, -r-&gt;

  <dd>This can be &quot;use&quot; (the default) or &quot;private&quot;. Setting
      it to &quot;private&quot; tells dyld to remove the shared region from the
      process address space and mmap() back in a private copy of the dyld shared
      cache in the shared region address range. This is only useful if the

  LIBRARY LOADING</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Unlike many other operating systems, Darwin does not locate
    dependent dynamic libraries via their leaf file name. Instead the full path
    to each dylib is used (e.g. /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib). But there are times
    when a full path is not appropriate; for instance, may want your binaries to
    be installable in anywhere on the disk. To support that, there are three
    @xxx/ variables that can be used as a path prefix. At runtime dyld
    substitutes a dynamically generated path for the @xxx/ prefix.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>@executable_path/</b></dt>
  <dd>This variable is replaced with the path to the directory containing the
      main executable for the process. This is useful for loading
      dylibs/frameworks embedded in a .app directory. If the main executable
      file is at /some/path/My.app/Contents/MacOS/My and a framework dylib file
      is at /some/path/My.app/Contents/Frameworks/Foo.framework/Versions/A/Foo,
      then the framework load path could be encoded as
      @executable_path/../Frameworks/Foo.framework/Versions/A/Foo and the .app
      directory could be moved around in the file system and dyld will still be
      able to load the embedded framework.</dd>
  <dt><b>@loader_path/</b></dt>
  <dd>This variable is replaced with the path to the directory containing the
      mach-o binary which contains the load command using @loader_path. Thus, in
      every binary, @loader_path resolves to a different path, whereas
      @executable_path always resolves to the same path. @loader_path is useful
      as the load path for a framework/dylib embedded in a plug-in, if the final
      file system location of the plugin-in unknown (so absolute paths cannot be
      used) or if the plug-in is used by multiple applications (so
      @executable_path cannot be used). If the plug-in mach-o file is at
      /some/path/Myfilter.plugin/Contents/MacOS/Myfilter and a framework dylib
      file is at
      /some/path/Myfilter.plugin/Contents/Frameworks/Foo.framework/Versions/A/Foo,
      then the framework load path could be encoded as
      @loader_path/../Frameworks/Foo.framework/Versions/A/Foo and the
      Myfilter.plugin directory could be moved around in the file system and
      dyld will still be able to load the embedded framework.</dd>
  <dt><b>@rpath/</b></dt>
  <dd>Dyld maintains a current stack of paths called the run path list. When
      @rpath is encountered it is substituted with each path in the run path
      list until a loadable dylib if found. The run path stack is built from the
      LC_RPATH load commands in the dependency chain that lead to the current
      dylib load. You can add an LC_RPATH load command to an image with the
      -rpath option to ld(1). You can even add a LC_RPATH load command path that
      starts with @loader_path/, and it will push a path on the run path stack
      that relative to the image containing the LC_RPATH. The use of @rpath is
      most useful when you have a complex directory structure of programs and
      dylibs which can be installed anywhere, but keep their relative positions.
      This scenario could be implemented using @loader_path, but every client of
      a dylib could need a different load path because its relative position in
      the file system is different. The use of @rpath introduces a level of
      indirection that simplifies things. You pick a location in your directory
      structure as an anchor point. Each dylib then gets an install path that
      starts with @rpath and is the path to the dylib relative to the anchor
      point. Each main executable is linked with -rpath @loader_path/zzz, where
      zzz is the path from the executable to the anchor point. At runtime dyld
      sets it run path to be the anchor point, then each dylib is found relative
      to the anchor point.</dd>
