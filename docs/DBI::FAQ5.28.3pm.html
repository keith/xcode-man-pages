  What is DBI, DBperl, Oraperl and *perl?</a></h2>
To quote Tim Bunce, the architect and author of DBI:
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
      DBI is a database access Application Programming Interface (API)
      for the Perl Language. The DBI API Specification defines a set
      of functions, variables and conventions that provide a consistent
      database interface independent of the actual database being used.
</pre>
<p class="Pp">In simple language, the DBI interface allows users to access
    multiple database types transparently. So, if you connecting to an Oracle,
    Informix, mSQL, Sybase or whatever database, you don't need to know the
    underlying mechanics of the 3GL layer. The API defined by DBI will work on
    <i>all</i> these database types.</p>
<p class="Pp">A similar benefit is gained by the ability to connect to two
    <i>different</i> databases of different vendor within the one perl script,
    <i>ie</i>, I want to read data from an Oracle database and insert it back
    into an Informix database all within one program. The DBI layer allows you
    to do this simply and powerfully.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>DBperl</i> is the old name for the interface specification.
    It's usually now used to denote perl<i>4</i> modules on database
    interfacing, such as, <i>oraperl</i>, <i>isqlperl</i>, <i>ingperl</i> and so
    on. These interfaces didn't have a standard API and are generally <i>not</i>
    supported.</p>
<p class="Pp">Here's a list of DBperl modules, their corresponding DBI
    counterparts and support information. <i>Please note</i>, the author's
    listed here generally <i>do not</i> maintain the DBI module for the same
    database. These email addresses are unverified and should only be used for
    queries concerning the perl4 modules listed below. DBI driver queries should
    be directed to the <i>dbi-users</i> mailing list.</p>

<p class="Pp">However, some DBI modules have DBperl emulation layers, so,
    <i>DBD::Oracle</i> comes with an Oraperl emulation layer, which allows you
    to run legacy oraperl scripts without modification. The emulation layer
    translates the oraperl API calls into DBI calls and executes them through
    the DBI switch.</p>

<p class="Pp">The <i>Msqlperl</i> emulation is a special case. <i>Msqlperl</i>
    is a perl5 driver for <i>mSQL</i> databases, but does not conform to the DBI
    Specification. It's use is being deprecated in favour of <i>DBD::mSQL</i>.

First off, consult the README for that driver in case there is useful
  information about the problem. It may be a known problem for your given
  architecture and operating system or database. You can check the README files
  for each driver in advance online at:
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    http://dbi.perl.org/
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If it's a known problem, you'll probably have to wait till it gets
    fixed. If you're <i>really</i> needing it fixed, try the following:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><i>Attempt to fix it yourself</i></dt>
  <dd>This technique is generally <i>not</i> recommended to the faint-hearted.
      If you do think you have managed to fix it, then, send a patch file (

</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>What the problem was, and test cases, if possible.</li>

    <p class="Pp">However, you might catch one of these creative genii at 3am
        when we're doing this sort of stuff anyway, and get a patch within 5

In terms of architecture - not much: Both define programming interfaces. Both
  allow multiple drivers to be loaded to do the actual work.
<p class="Pp">In terms of ease of use - much: The DBI is a 'high level'
    interface that, like Perl itself, strives to make the simple things easy
    while still making the hard things possible. The ODBC is a 'low level'
    interface. All nuts-bolts-knobs-and-dials.</p>
<p class="Pp">Now there's an ODBC driver for the DBI (DBD::ODBC) the
    &quot;What's the difference&quot; question is more usefully rephrased

  What's the difference between Win32::ODBC and DBD::ODBC?</a></h2>
The DBI, and thus DBD::ODBC, has a different philosophy from the Win32::ODBC
  module:
<p class="Pp">The Win32::ODBC module is a 'thin' layer over the low-level ODBC
    API. The DBI defines a simpler 'higher level' interface.</p>
<p class="Pp">The Win32::ODBC module gives you access to more of the ODBC API.
    The DBI and DBD::ODBC give you access to only the essentials. (But, unlike
    Win32::ODBC, the DBI and DBD::ODBC do support parameter binding and multiple
    prepared statements which reduces the load on the database server and can
    dramatically increase performance.)</p>
<p class="Pp">The Win32::ODBC module only works on Win32 systems. The DBI and
    DBD::ODBC are very portable and work on Win32 and Unix.</p>
<p class="Pp">The DBI and DBD::ODBC modules are supplied as a standard part of
    the Perl 5.004 binary distribution for Win32 (they don't work with the
    older, non-standard, ActiveState port).</p>
<p class="Pp">Scripts written with the DBI and DBD::ODBC are faster than
    Win32::ODBC on Win32 and are trivially portable to other supported database
    types.</p>
<p class="Pp">The DBI offers optional automatic printing or <i>die()</i>ing on
    errors which makes applications simpler and more robust.</p>
<p class="Pp">The current DBD::ODBC driver version 0.16 is new and not yet fully
    stable. A new release is due soon [relative to the date of the next TPJ
    issue :-] and will be much improved and offer more ODBC functionality.</p>
<p class="Pp">To summarise: The Win32::ODBC module is your best choice if you
    need access to more of the ODBC API than the DBI gives you. Otherwise, the
    DBI and DBD::ODBC combination may be your best bet.</p>

<pre>
    ``UNIX was originally blessed with simple file-based ``databases'', namely
    the dbm system. dbm lets you store data in files, and retrieve
    that data quickly. However, it also has serious drawbacks.

        File Locking

        The dbm systems did not allow particularly robust file locking
        capabilities, nor any capability for correcting problems arising through
        simultaneous writes [ to the database ].

        Arbitrary Data Structures

        The dbm systems only allows a single fixed data structure:
        key-value pairs. That value could be a complex object, such as a
        [ C ] struct, but the key had to be unique. This was a large
        limitation on the usefulness of dbm systems.

    However, dbm systems still provide a useful function for users with
    simple datasets and limited resources, since they are fast, robust and
    extremely well-tested. Perl modules to access dbm systems have now
    been integrated into the core Perl distribution via the
    AnyDBM_File module.''
</pre>
<p class="Pp">To sum up, DBM is a perfectly satisfactory solution for
    essentially read-only databases, or small and simple datasets. However, for
    more scalable dataset handling, not to mention robust transactional locking,
    users are recommended to use a more powerful database engine <i>via</i>
    <i>DBI</i>.</p>

    files in detail.</p>

  What database do you recommend me using?</a></h2>
This is a particularly thorny area in which an objective answer is difficult to
  come by, since each dataset, proposed usage and system configuration differs
  from person to person.
<p class="Pp">From the current author's point of view, if the dataset is
    relatively small, being tables of less than 1 million rows, and less than
    1000 tables in a given database, then <i>mSQL</i> is a perfectly acceptable
    solution to your problem. This database is extremely cheap, is wonderfully
    robust and has excellent support. More information is available on the
    Hughes Technology WWW site at:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    http://www.hughes.com.au
</pre>
<p class="Pp">You may also wish to look at MySQL which is a more powerful
    database engine that has a similar feel to mSQL.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    http://www.tcx.se
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If the dataset is larger than 1 million row tables or 1000 tables,
    or if you have either more money, or larger machines, I would recommend
    <i>Oracle RDBMS</i>. Oracle's WWW site is an excellent source of more
    information.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    http://www.oracle.com
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><i>Informix</i> is another high-end RDBMS that is worth
    considering. There are several differences between Oracle and Informix which
    are too complex for this document to detail. Information on Informix can be
    found on their WWW site at:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    http://www.informix.com
</pre>
<p class="Pp">In the case of WWW fronted applications, <i>mSQL</i> may be a
    better option due to slow connection times between a CGI script and the
    Oracle RDBMS and also the amount of resource each Oracle connection will
    consume. <i>mSQL</i> is lighter resource-wise and faster.</p>

Given that we're making the assumption that the feature you have requested is a

<p class="Pp">DBI reflects a <i>generic</i> API that will work for most

<p class="Pp">However, driver authors may, if they so desire, include hooks to
    database-specific functionality through the

    Script developers should note that use of functionality provided <i>via</i>

<p class="Pp">DBI confers the ability to CGI programmers to power WWW-fronted
    databases to their users, which provides users with vast quantities of

    they can upgrade the database server behind the scenes with no alterations

  ``When I run a perl script from the command line, it works, but, when I run it

Basically, a good chance this is occurring is due to the fact that the user that
  you ran it from the command line as has a correctly configured set of
  environment variables, in the case of <i>DBD::Oracle</i>, variables like
  <span class="Li">&quot;ORACLE_HOME&quot;</span>,
  <span class="Li">&quot;ORACLE_SID&quot;</span> or

<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;httpd&quot;</span> process usually runs
    under the user id of <span class="Li">&quot;nobody&quot;</span>, which
    implies there is no configured environment. Any scripts attempting to
    execute in this situation will correctly fail.</p>
<p class="Pp">One way to solve this problem is to set the environment for your
    database in a <span class="Li">&quot;BEGIN { }&quot;</span> block at the top
    of your script. Another technique is to configure your WWW server to
    pass-through certain environment variables to your CGI scripts.</p>
<p class="Pp">Similarly, you should check your
    <span class="Li">&quot;httpd&quot;</span> error logfile for any clues, as
    well as the ``Idiot's Guide To Solving Perl / CGI Problems'' and ``Perl CGI

  How do I handle BLOB data with DBI?</a></h2>
Handling BLOB data with the DBI is very straight-forward. BLOB columns are
  specified in a SELECT statement as per normal columns. However, you also need
  to specify a maximum BLOB size that the &lt;I&gt;database handle&lt;/I&gt; can
  fetch using the <span class="Li">&quot;LongReadLen&quot;</span> attribute.
<p class="Pp">For example:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    ### $dbh is a connected database handle
    $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare( &quot;SELECT blob_column FROM blobby_table&quot; );
    $sth-&gt;execute;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">would fail.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    ### $dbh is a connected database handle
    ### Set the maximum BLOB size...
    $dbh-&gt;{LongReadLen} = 16384;        ### 16Kb...Not much of a BLOB!

    $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare( &quot;...&quot; );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">would succeed &lt;I&gt;provided no column values were larger than
    the specified value&lt;/I&gt;.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the BLOB data is longer than the value of
    <span class="Li">&quot;LongReadLen&quot;</span>, then an error will occur.
    However, the DBI provides an additional piece of functionality that will
    automatically truncate the fetched BLOB to the size of
    <span class="Li">&quot;LongReadLen&quot;</span> if it is longer. This does
    not cause an error to occur, but may make your fetched BLOB data
  useless.</p>
<p class="Pp">This behaviour is regulated by the
    <span class="Li">&quot;LongTruncOk&quot;</span> attribute which is set to a
    false value by default ( thus making overlong BLOB fetches fail ).</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    ### Set BLOB handling such that it's 16Kb and can be truncated
    $dbh-&gt;{LongReadLen} = 16384;
    $dbh-&gt;{LongTruncOk} = 1;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Truncation of BLOB data may not be a big deal in cases where the
    BLOB contains run-length encoded data, but data containing checksums at the
    end, for example, a ZIP file, would be rendered useless.</p>

Database creation and deletion are concepts that are entirely too abstract to be
  adequately supported by DBI. For example, Oracle does not support the concept
  of dropping a database at all! Also, in Oracle, the database <i>server</i>
  essentially <i>is</i> the database, whereas in mSQL, the server process runs
  happily without any databases created in it. The problem is too disparate to
  attack in a worthwhile way.
<p class="Pp">Some drivers, therefore, support database creation and deletion
    through the private <span class="Li">&quot;func()&quot;</span> methods. You
    should check the documentation for the drivers you are using to see if they
    support this mechanism.</p>

  DBI?</a></h2>
See the <span class="Li">&quot;commit()&quot;</span> and
  <span class="Li">&quot;rollback()&quot;</span> methods in the DBI
  Specification.
<p class="Pp">Chapter 6 of &quot;Programming the Perl DBI&quot; discusses

  How are &quot;NULL&quot; values handled by DBI?</a></h2>
<span class="Li">&quot;NULL&quot;</span> values in DBI are specified to be
  treated as the value <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span>.
  <span class="Li">&quot;NULL&quot;</span>s can be inserted into databases as
  <span class="Li">&quot;NULL&quot;</span>, for example:
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    $rv = $dbh-&gt;do( &quot;INSERT INTO table VALUES( NULL )&quot; );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">but when queried back, the
    <span class="Li">&quot;NULL&quot;</span>s should be tested against
    <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span>. This is standard across all
    drivers.</p>

  What are these &quot;func()&quot; methods all about?</a></h2>
The <span class="Li">&quot;func()&quot;</span> method is defined within DBI as
  being an entry point for database-specific functionality, <i>eg</i>, the
  ability to create or drop databases. Invoking these driver-specific methods is
  simple, for example, to invoke a
  <span class="Li">&quot;createDatabase&quot;</span> method that has one
  argument, we would write:
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    $rv =$dbh-&gt;func( 'argument', 'createDatabase' );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Software developers should note that the
    <span class="Li">&quot;func()&quot;</span> methods are non-portable between
    databases.</p>

  Is DBI Year 2000 Compliant?</a></h2>
DBI has no knowledge of understanding of what dates are. Therefore, DBI itself
  does not have a Year 2000 problem. Individual drivers may use date handling
  code internally and therefore be potentially susceptible to the Year 2000
  problem, but this is unlikely.

    problem?'' section of the Perl FAQ at:</p>
