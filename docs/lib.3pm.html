   Set up some character translations and predefined strings.  \*(-- will
   give an unbreakable dash, \*(PI will give pi, \*(L" will give a left
   double quote, and \*(R" will give a right double quote.  \*(C+ will
   give a nicer C++.  Capital omega is used to do unbreakable dashes and
   therefore won't be available.  \*(C` and \*(C' expand to `' in nroff,
   nothing in troff, for use with C<>.

This is a small simple module which simplifies the manipulation of
  <span class="Li">@INC</span> at compile time.
<p class="Pp">It is typically used to add extra directories to perl's search
    path so that later <span class="Li">&quot;use&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;require&quot;</span> statements will find modules
    which are not located on perl's default search path.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Adding_directories_to_@INC"><a class="permalink" href="#Adding_directories_to_@INC">Adding
  directories to @INC</a></h2>
The parameters to <span class="Li">&quot;use lib&quot;</span> are added to the
  start of the perl search path. Saying
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    use lib LIST;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">is <i>almost</i> the same as saying</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    BEGIN { unshift(@INC, LIST) }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">For each directory in LIST (called <span class="Li">$dir</span>
    here) the lib module also checks to see if a directory called
    <span class="Li">$dir</span>/$archname/auto exists. If so the
    <span class="Li">$dir</span>/$archname directory is assumed to be a
    corresponding architecture specific directory and is added to
    <span class="Li">@INC</span> in front of <span class="Li">$dir</span>.
    lib.pm also checks if directories called
    <span class="Li">$dir</span>/$version and
    <span class="Li">$dir</span>/$version/$archname exist and adds these
    directories to <span class="Li">@INC</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The current value of <span class="Li">$archname</span> can be
    found with this command:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    perl -V:archname
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The corresponding command to get the current value of
    <span class="Li">$version</span> is:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    perl -V:version
</pre>
<p class="Pp">To avoid memory leaks, all trailing duplicate entries in
    <span class="Li">@INC</span> are removed.</p>

You should normally only add directories to <span class="Li">@INC</span>. If you
  need to delete directories from <span class="Li">@INC</span> take care to only
  delete those which you added yourself or which you are certain are not needed
  by other modules in your script. Other modules may have added directories
  which they need for correct operation.
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;no lib&quot;</span> statement deletes
    all instances of each named directory from <span class="Li">@INC</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">For each directory in LIST (called <span class="Li">$dir</span>
    here) the lib module also checks to see if a directory called
    <span class="Li">$dir</span>/$archname/auto exists. If so the
    <span class="Li">$dir</span>/$archname directory is assumed to be a
    corresponding architecture specific directory and is also deleted from

When the lib module is first loaded it records the current value of
  <span class="Li">@INC</span> in an array
  <span class="Li">@lib::ORIG_INC</span>. To restore
  <span class="Li">@INC</span> to that value you can say
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    @INC = @lib::ORIG_INC;

In order to keep lib.pm small and simple, it only works with Unix filepaths.
  This doesn't mean it only works on Unix, but non-Unix users must first
  translate their file paths to Unix conventions.
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    # VMS users wanting to put [.stuff.moo] into 
    # their @INC would write
    use lib 'stuff/moo';

In the future, this module will likely use File::Spec for determining paths, as
  it does now for Mac OS (where Unix-style or Mac-style paths work, and
  Unix-style paths are converted properly to Mac-style paths before being added
  to <span class="Li">@INC</span>).
<p class="Pp">If you try to add a file to <span class="Li">@INC</span> as
    follows:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  use lib 'this_is_a_file.txt';
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;lib&quot;</span> will warn about this. The
    sole exceptions are files with the <span class="Li">&quot;.par&quot;</span>
    extension which are intended to be used as libraries.</p>
