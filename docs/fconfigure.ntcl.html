   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The <b>fconfigure</b> command sets and retrieves options for
    channels.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>ChannelId</i> identifies the channel for which to set or query
    an option and must refer to an open channel such as a Tcl standard channel
    (<b>stdin</b>, <b>stdout</b>, or <b>stderr</b>), the return value from an
    invocation of <b>open</b> or <b>socket</b>, or the result of a channel
    creation command provided by a Tcl extension.</p>
<p class="Pp">If no <i>name</i> or <i>value</i> arguments are supplied, the
    command returns a list containing alternating option names and values for
    the channel. If <i>name</i> is supplied but no <i>value</i> then the command
    returns the current value of the given option. If one or more pairs of
    <i>name</i> and <i>value</i> are supplied, the command sets each of the
    named options to the corresponding <i>value</i>; in this case the return
    value is an empty string.</p>
<p class="Pp">The options described below are supported for all channels. In
    addition, each channel type may add options that only it supports. See the
    manual entry for the command that creates each type of channels for the
    options that that specific type of channel supports. For example, see the
    manual entry for the <b>socket</b> command for its additional options.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="blocking"><a class="permalink" href="#blocking"><b>-blocking</b>
    <i>boolean</i></a></dt>
  <dd>The <b>-blocking</b> option determines whether I/O operations on the
      channel can cause the process to block indefinitely. The value of the
      option must be a proper boolean value. Channels are normally in blocking
      mode; if a channel is placed into nonblocking mode it will affect the
      operation of the <b>gets</b>, <b>read</b>, <b>puts</b>, <b>flush</b>, and
      <b>close</b> commands by allowing them to operate asynchronously; see the
      documentation for those commands for details. For nonblocking mode to work
      correctly, the application must be using the Tcl event loop (e.g. by
      calling <b>Tcl_DoOneEvent</b> or invoking the <b>vwait</b> command).</dd>
  <dt id="buffering"><a class="permalink" href="#buffering"><b>-buffering</b>
    <i>newValue</i></a></dt>
  <dd>If <i>newValue</i> is <b>full</b> then the I/O system will buffer output
      until its internal buffer is full or until the <b>flush</b> command is
      invoked. If <i>newValue</i> is <b>line</b>, then the I/O system will
      automatically flush output for the channel whenever a newline character is
      output. If <i>newValue</i> is <b>none</b>, the I/O system will flush
      automatically after every output operation. The default is for
      <b>-buffering</b> to be set to <b>full</b> except for channels that
      connect to terminal-like devices; for these channels the initial setting
      is <b>line</b>. Additionally, <b>stdin</b> and <b>stdout</b> are initially
      set to <b>line</b>, and <b>stderr</b> is set to <b>none</b>.</dd>
  <dt id="buffersize"><a class="permalink" href="#buffersize"><b>-buffersize</b>
    <i>newSize</i></a></dt>
  <dd><i>Newvalue</i> must be an integer; its value is used to set the size of
      buffers, in bytes, subsequently allocated for this channel to store input
      or output. <i>Newvalue</i> must be between ten and one million, allowing
      buffers of ten to one million bytes in size.</dd>
  <dt id="encoding"><a class="permalink" href="#encoding"><b>-encoding</b>
    <i>name</i></a></dt>
  <dd>This option is used to specify the encoding of the channel, so that the
      data can be converted to and from Unicode for use in Tcl. For instance, in
      order for Tcl to read characters from a Japanese file in <b>shiftjis</b>
      and properly process and display the contents, the encoding would be set
      to <b>shiftjis</b>. Thereafter, when reading from the channel, the bytes
      in the Japanese file would be converted to Unicode as they are read.
      Writing is also supported - as Tcl strings are written to the channel they
      will automatically be converted to the specified encoding on output.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">If a file contains pure binary data (for instance, a JPEG image),
    the encoding for the channel should be configured to be <b>binary</b>. Tcl
    will then assign no interpretation to the data in the file and simply read
    or write raw bytes. The Tcl <b>binary</b> command can be used to manipulate
    this byte-oriented data. It is usually better to set the <b>-translation</b>
    option to <b>binary</b> when you want to transfer binary data, as this turns
    off the other automatic interpretations of the bytes in the stream as
  well.</p>
<p class="Pp">The default encoding for newly opened channels is the same
    platform- and locale-dependent system encoding used for interfacing with the
    operating system, as returned by <b>encoding system</b>.</p>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="eofchar"><a class="permalink" href="#eofchar"><b>-eofchar</b>
    <i>char</i></a></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt id="eofchar~2"><a class="permalink" href="#eofchar~2"><b>-eofchar</b>
    <b>{</b><i>inChar outChar</i><b>}</b></a></dt>
  <dd>This option supports DOS file systems that use Control-z (\x1a) as an end
      of file marker. If <i>char</i> is not an empty string, then this character
      signals end-of-file when it is encountered during input. For output, the
      end-of-file character is output when the channel is closed. If <i>char</i>
      is the empty string, then there is no special end of file character
      marker. For read-write channels, a two-element list specifies the end of
      file marker for input and output, respectively. As a convenience, when
      setting the end-of-file character for a read-write channel you can specify
      a single value that will apply to both reading and writing. When querying
      the end-of-file character of a read-write channel, a two-element list will
      always be returned. The default value for <b>-eofchar</b> is the empty
      string in all cases except for files under Windows. In that case the
      <b>-eofchar</b> is Control-z (\x1a) for reading and the empty string for
      writing. The acceptable range for <b>-eofchar</b> values is \x01 - \x7f;
      attempting to set <b>-eofchar</b> to a value outside of this range will
      generate an error.</dd>
  <dt id="translation"><a class="permalink" href="#translation"><b>-translation</b>
    <i>mode</i></a></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt id="translation~2"><a class="permalink" href="#translation~2"><b>-translation</b>
    <b>{</b><i>inMode outMode</i><b>}</b></a></dt>
  <dd>In Tcl scripts the end of a line is always represented using a single
      newline character (\n). However, in actual files and devices the end of a
      line may be represented differently on different platforms, or even for
      different devices on the same platform. For example, under UNIX newlines
      are used in files, whereas carriage-return-linefeed sequences are normally
      used in network connections. On input (i.e., with <b>gets</b> and
      <b>read</b>) the Tcl I/O system automatically translates the external
      end-of-line representation into newline characters. Upon output (i.e.,
      with <b>puts</b>), the I/O system translates newlines to the external
      end-of-line representation. The default translation mode, <b>auto</b>,
      handles all the common cases automatically, but the <b>-translation</b>
      option provides explicit control over the end of line translations.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">The value associated with <b>-translation</b> is a single item for
    read-only and write-only channels. The value is a two-element list for
    read-write channels; the read translation mode is the first element of the
    list, and the write translation mode is the second element. As a
    convenience, when setting the translation mode for a read-write channel you
    can specify a single value that will apply to both reading and writing. When
    querying the translation mode of a read-write channel, a two-element list
    will always be returned. The following values are currently supported:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="auto"><a class="permalink" href="#auto"><b>auto</b></a></dt>
  <dd>As the input translation mode, <b>auto</b> treats any of newline
      (<b>lf</b>), carriage return (<b>cr</b>), or carriage return followed by a
      newline (<b>crlf</b>) as the end of line representation. The end of line
      representation can even change from line-to-line, and all cases are
      translated to a newline. As the output translation mode, <b>auto</b>
      chooses a platform specific representation; for sockets on all platforms
      Tcl chooses <b>crlf</b>, for all Unix flavors, it chooses <b>lf</b>, and
      for the various flavors of Windows it chooses <b>crlf</b>. The default
      setting for <b>-translation</b> is <b>auto</b> for both input and
    output.</dd>
  <dt id="binary"><a class="permalink" href="#binary"><b>binary</b></a></dt>
  <dd>No end-of-line translations are performed. This is nearly identical to
      <b>lf</b> mode, except that in addition <b>binary</b> mode also sets the
      end-of-file character to the empty string (which disables it) and sets the
      encoding to <b>binary</b> (which disables encoding filtering). See the
      description of <b>-eofchar</b> and <b>-encoding</b> for more
    information.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">Internally, i.e. when it comes to the actual behaviour of the
    translator this value <b>is</b> identical to <b>lf</b> and is therefore
    reported as such when queried. Even if <b>binary</b> was used to set the
    translation.</p>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="cr"><a class="permalink" href="#cr"><b>cr</b></a></dt>
  <dd>The end of a line in the underlying file or device is represented by a
      single carriage return character. As the input translation mode, <b>cr</b>
      mode converts carriage returns to newline characters. As the output
      translation mode, <b>cr</b> mode translates newline characters to carriage
      returns.</dd>
  <dt id="crlf"><a class="permalink" href="#crlf"><b>crlf</b></a></dt>
  <dd>The end of a line in the underlying file or device is represented by a
      carriage return character followed by a linefeed character. As the input
      translation mode, <b>crlf</b> mode converts carriage-return-linefeed
      sequences to newline characters. As the output translation mode,
      <b>crlf</b> mode translates newline characters to carriage-return-linefeed
      sequences. This mode is typically used on Windows platforms and for
      network connections.</dd>
  <dt id="lf"><a class="permalink" href="#lf"><b>lf</b></a></dt>
  <dd>The end of a line in the underlying file or device is represented by a
      single newline (linefeed) character. In this mode no translations occur
      during either input or output. This mode is typically used on UNIX
      platforms.</dd>

<p class="Pp">The Tcl standard channels (<b>stdin</b>, <b>stdout</b>, and
