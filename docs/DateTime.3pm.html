DateTime is a class for the representation of date/time combinations, and is
  part of the Perl DateTime project. For details on this project please see
  &lt;http://datetime.perl.org/&gt;. The DateTime site has a FAQ which may help
  answer many &quot;how do I do X?&quot; questions. The FAQ is at
  &lt;http://datetime.perl.org/wiki/datetime/page/FAQ&gt;.
<p class="Pp">It represents the Gregorian calendar, extended backwards in time
    before its creation (in 1582). This is sometimes known as the
    &quot;proleptic Gregorian calendar&quot;. In this calendar, the first day of
    the calendar (the epoch), is the first day of year 1, which corresponds to
    the date which was (incorrectly) believed to be the birth of Jesus
  Christ.</p>
<p class="Pp">The calendar represented does have a year 0, and in that way
    differs from how dates are often written using &quot;BCE/CE&quot; or
    &quot;BC/AD&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">For infinite datetimes, please see the DateTime::Infinite
  module.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="0_-based_Versus_1_-based_Numbers"><a class="permalink" href="#0_-based_Versus_1_-based_Numbers">0-based
  Versus 1-based Numbers</a></h2>
The DateTime.pm module follows a simple logic for determining whether or not a
  given number is 0-based or 1-based.
<p class="Pp">Month, day of month, day of week, and day of year are 1-based. Any
    method that is 1-based also has an equivalent 0-based method ending in
    &quot;_0&quot;. So for example, this class provides both
    <span class="Li">&quot;day_of_week()&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;day_of_week_0()&quot;</span> methods.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;day_of_week_0()&quot;</span> method
    still treats Monday as the first day of the week.</p>
<p class="Pp">All <i>time</i>-related numbers such as hour, minute, and second
    are 0-based.</p>
<p class="Pp">Years are neither, as they can be both positive or negative,
    unlike any other datetime component. There <i>is</i> a year 0.</p>
<p class="Pp">There is no <span class="Li">&quot;quarter_0()&quot;</span>
    method.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Error_Handling"><a class="permalink" href="#Error_Handling">Error
  Handling</a></h2>
Some errors may cause this module to die with an error string. This can only
  happen when calling constructor methods, methods that change the object, such
  as <span class="Li">&quot;set()&quot;</span>, or methods that take parameters.
  Methods that retrieve information about the object, such as
  <span class="Li">&quot;year()&quot;</span> or
  <span class="Li">&quot;epoch()&quot;</span>, will never die.
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Locales"><a class="permalink" href="#Locales">Locales</a></h2>
All the object methods which return names or abbreviations return data based on
  a locale. This is done by setting the locale when constructing a DateTime
  object. If this is not set, then &quot;en-US&quot; is used.
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Floating_DateTimes"><a class="permalink" href="#Floating_DateTimes">Floating
  DateTimes</a></h2>
The default time zone for new DateTime objects, except where stated otherwise,
  is the &quot;floating&quot; time zone. This concept comes from the iCal
  standard. A floating datetime is one which is not anchored to any particular
  time zone. In addition, floating datetimes do not include leap seconds, since
  we cannot apply them without knowing the datetime's time zone.
<p class="Pp">The results of date math and comparison between a floating
    datetime and one with a real time zone are not really valid, because one
    includes leap seconds and the other does not. Similarly, the results of
    datetime math between two floating datetimes and two datetimes with time
    zones are not really comparable.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you are planning to use any objects with a real time zone, it
    is strongly recommended that you <b>do not</b> mix these with floating
    datetimes.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Math"><a class="permalink" href="#Math">Math</a></h2>

  DateTime Math Works&quot;.

<h2 class="Ss" id="Determining_the_Local_Time_Zone_Can_Be_Slow"><a class="permalink" href="#Determining_the_Local_Time_Zone_Can_Be_Slow">Determining
  the Local Time Zone Can Be Slow</a></h2>
If <span class="Li">$ENV{TZ}</span> is not set, it may involve reading a number
  of files in <i>/etc</i> or elsewhere. If you know that the local time zone
  won't change while your code is running, and you need to make many objects for
  the local time zone, it is strongly recommended that you retrieve the local
  time zone once and cache it:
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  our $App::LocalTZ = DateTime::TimeZone-&gt;new( name =&gt; 'local' );

  ... # then everywhere else

  my $dt = DateTime-&gt;new( ..., time_zone =&gt; $App::LocalTZ );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">DateTime itself does not do this internally because local time
    zones can change, and there's no good way to determine if it's changed
    without doing all the work to look it up.</p>
<p class="Pp">Do not try to use named time zones (like
    &quot;America/Chicago&quot;) with dates very far in the future (thousands of
    years). The current implementation of
    <span class="Li">&quot;DateTime::TimeZone&quot;</span> will use a huge
    amount of memory calculating all the DST changes from now until the future
    date. Use UTC or the floating time zone and you will be safe.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Globally_Setting_a_Default_Time_Zone"><a class="permalink" href="#Globally_Setting_a_Default_Time_Zone">Globally
  Setting a Default Time Zone</a></h2>
<b>Warning: This is very dangerous. Do this at your own risk!</b>
<p class="Pp">By default, <span class="Li">&quot;DateTime&quot;</span> uses
    either the floating time zone or UTC for newly created objects, depending on
    the constructor.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can force <span class="Li">&quot;DateTime&quot;</span> to use
    a different time zone by setting the
    <span class="Li">&quot;PERL_DATETIME_DEFAULT_TZ&quot;</span> environment
    variable.</p>
<p class="Pp">As noted above, this is very dangerous, as it affects all code
    that creates a <span class="Li">&quot;DateTime&quot;</span> object,
    including modules from CPAN. If those modules expect the normal default,
    then setting this can cause confusing breakage or subtly broken data. Before
    setting this variable, you are strongly encouraged to audit your CPAN
    dependencies to see how they use
    <span class="Li">&quot;DateTime&quot;</span>. Try running the test suite for
    each dependency with this environment variable set before using this in
    production.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Upper_and_Lower_Bounds"><a class="permalink" href="#Upper_and_Lower_Bounds">Upper
  and Lower Bounds</a></h2>
Internally, dates are represented the number of days before or after 0001-01-01.
  This is stored as an integer, meaning that the upper and lower bounds are
  based on your Perl's integer size (<span class="Li">$Config{ivsize}</span>).
<p class="Pp">The limit on 32-bit systems is around 2^29 days, which gets you to
    year (+/-)1,469,903. On a 64-bit system you get 2^62 days,
    (+/-)12,626,367,463,883,278 (12.626 quadrillion).</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="METHODS"><a class="permalink" href="#METHODS">METHODS</a></h1>
DateTime provide many methods. The documentation breaks them down into groups
  based on what they do (constructor, accessors, modifiers, etc.).
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Constructors"><a class="permalink" href="#Constructors">Constructors</a></h2>
All constructors can die when invalid parameters are given.
<p class="Pp"><i>Warnings</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Currently, constructors will warn if you try to create a far
    future DateTime (year &gt;= 5000) with any time zone besides floating or
    UTC. This can be very slow if the time zone has future DST transitions that
    need to be calculated. If the date is sufficiently far in the future this
    can be <i>really</i> slow (minutes).</p>
<p class="Pp">All warnings from DateTime use the
    <span class="Li">&quot;DateTime&quot;</span> category and can be suppressed
    with:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    no warnings 'DateTime';
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This warning may be removed in the future if DateTime::TimeZone is
    made much faster.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>DateTime-&gt;new( ... )</i></p>
<p class="Pp">This class method accepts parameters for each date and time
    component: &quot;year&quot;, &quot;month&quot;, &quot;day&quot;,
    &quot;hour&quot;, &quot;minute&quot;, &quot;second&quot;,
    &quot;nanosecond&quot;. It also accepts &quot;locale&quot;,
    &quot;time_zone&quot;, and &quot;formatter&quot; parameters.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  my $dt = DateTime-&gt;new(
      year       =&gt; 1966,
      month      =&gt; 10,
      day        =&gt; 25,
      hour       =&gt; 7,
      minute     =&gt; 15,
      second     =&gt; 47,
      nanosecond =&gt; 500000000,
      time_zone  =&gt; 'America/Chicago',
  );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">DateTime validates the &quot;month&quot;, &quot;day&quot;,
    &quot;hour&quot;, &quot;minute&quot;, and &quot;second&quot;, and
    &quot;nanosecond&quot; parameters. The valid values for these parameters
    are:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>month
    <p class="Pp">An integer from 1-12.</p>
  </li>
  <li>day
    <p class="Pp">An integer from 1-31, and it must be within the valid range of
        days for the specified month.</p>
  </li>
  <li>hour
    <p class="Pp">An integer from 0-23.</p>
  </li>
  <li>minute
    <p class="Pp">An integer from 0-59.</p>
  </li>
  <li>second
    <p class="Pp">An integer from 0-61 (to allow for leap seconds). Values of 60
        or 61 are only allowed when they match actual leap seconds.</p>
  </li>
  <li>nanosecond
    <p class="Pp">An integer &gt;= 0. If this number is greater than 1 billion,
        it will be normalized into the second value for the DateTime object.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">Invalid parameter types (like an array reference) will cause the
    constructor to die.</p>
<p class="Pp">The value for seconds may be from 0 to 61, to account for leap
    seconds. If you give a value greater than 59, DateTime does check to see
    that it really matches a valid leap second.</p>
<p class="Pp">All of the parameters are optional except for &quot;year&quot;.
    The &quot;month&quot; and &quot;day&quot; parameters both default to 1,
    while the &quot;hour&quot;, &quot;minute&quot;, &quot;second&quot;, and
    &quot;nanosecond&quot; parameters all default to 0.</p>
<p class="Pp">The &quot;locale&quot; parameter should be a string containing a
    locale code, like &quot;en-US&quot; or &quot;zh-Hant-TW&quot;, or an object
    returned by <span class="Li">&quot;DateTime::Locale-&gt;load&quot;</span>.
    See the DateTime::Locale documentation for details.</p>
<p class="Pp">The &quot;time_zone&quot; parameter can be either a string or a
    <span class="Li">&quot;DateTime::TimeZone&quot;</span> object. A string will
    simply be passed to the
    <span class="Li">&quot;DateTime::TimeZone-&gt;new&quot;</span> method as its
    &quot;name&quot; parameter. This string may be an Olson DB time zone name
    (&quot;America/Chicago&quot;), an offset string (&quot;+0630&quot;), or the
    words &quot;floating&quot; or &quot;local&quot;. See the
    <span class="Li">&quot;DateTime::TimeZone&quot;</span> documentation for
    more details.</p>
<p class="Pp">The default time zone is &quot;floating&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">The &quot;formatter&quot; can be either a scalar or an object, but
    the class specified by the scalar or the object must implement a
    <span class="Li">&quot;format_datetime()&quot;</span> method.</p>
<p class="Pp">Parsing Dates</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>This module does not parse dates!</b> That means there is no
    constructor to which you can pass things like &quot;March 3, 1970
    12:34&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">Instead, take a look at the various
    <span class="Li">&quot;DateTime::Format::*&quot;</span> modules on CPAN.
    These parse all sorts of different date formats, and you're bound to find
    something that can handle your particular needs.</p>
<p class="Pp">Ambiguous Local Times</p>
<p class="Pp">Because of Daylight Saving Time, it is possible to specify a local
    time that is ambiguous. For example, in the US in 2003, the transition from
    to saving to standard time occurred on October 26, at 02:00:00 local time.
    The local clock changed from 01:59:59 (saving time) to 01:00:00 (standard
    time). This means that the hour from 01:00:00 through 01:59:59 actually
    occurs twice, though the UTC time continues to move forward.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you specify an ambiguous time, then the latest UTC time is
    always used, in effect always choosing standard time. In this case, you can
    simply subtract an hour to the object in order to move to saving time, for
    example:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  # This object represent 01:30:00 standard time
  my $dt = DateTime-&gt;new(
      year      =&gt; 2003,
      month     =&gt; 10,
      day       =&gt; 26,
      hour      =&gt; 1,
      minute    =&gt; 30,
      second    =&gt; 0,
      time_zone =&gt; 'America/Chicago',
  );

  print $dt-&gt;hms;  # prints 01:30:00

  # Now the object represent 01:30:00 saving time
  $dt-&gt;subtract( hours =&gt; 1 );

  print $dt-&gt;hms;  # still prints 01:30:00
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Alternately, you could create the object with the UTC time zone,
    and then call the <span class="Li">&quot;set_time_zone()&quot;</span> method
    to change the time zone. This is a good way to ensure that the time is not
    ambiguous.</p>
<p class="Pp">Invalid Local Times</p>
<p class="Pp">Another problem introduced by Daylight Saving Time is that certain
    local times just do not exist. For example, in the US in 2003, the
    transition from standard to saving time occurred on April 6, at the change
    to 2:00:00 local time. The local clock changes from 01:59:59 (standard time)
    to 03:00:00 (saving time). This means that there is no 02:00:00 through
    02:59:59 on April 6!</p>
<p class="Pp">Attempting to create an invalid time currently causes a fatal
    error. This may change in future version of this module.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>DateTime-&gt;from_epoch( epoch =&gt; </i><i>$epoch</i><i>, ...
    )</i></p>
<p class="Pp">This class method can be used to construct a new DateTime object
    from an epoch time instead of components. Just as with the
    <span class="Li">&quot;new()&quot;</span> method, it accepts
    &quot;time_zone&quot;, &quot;locale&quot;, and &quot;formatter&quot;
    parameters.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the epoch value is a floating-point value, it will be rounded
    to nearest microsecond.</p>
<p class="Pp">By default, the returned object will be in the UTC time zone.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>DateTime-&gt;now( ... )</i></p>
<p class="Pp">This class method is equivalent to calling
    <span class="Li">&quot;from_epoch()&quot;</span> with the value returned
    from Perl's <span class="Li">&quot;time()&quot;</span> function. Just as
    with the <span class="Li">&quot;new()&quot;</span> method, it accepts
    &quot;time_zone&quot; and &quot;locale&quot; parameters.</p>
<p class="Pp">By default, the returned object will be in the UTC time zone.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>DateTime-&gt;today( ... )</i></p>
<p class="Pp">This class method is equivalent to:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  DateTime-&gt;now(@_)-&gt;truncate( to =&gt; 'day' );
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><i>DateTime-&gt;from_object( object =&gt; </i><i>$object</i><i>,
    ... )</i></p>
<p class="Pp">This class method can be used to construct a new DateTime object
    from any object that implements the
    <span class="Li">&quot;utc_rd_values()&quot;</span> method. All
    <span class="Li">&quot;DateTime::Calendar&quot;</span> modules must
    implement this method in order to provide cross-calendar compatibility. This
    method accepts a &quot;locale&quot; and &quot;formatter&quot; parameter</p>
<p class="Pp">If the object passed to this method has a
    <span class="Li">&quot;time_zone()&quot;</span> method, that is used to set
    the time zone of the newly created
    <span class="Li">&quot;DateTime.pm&quot;</span> object.</p>
<p class="Pp">Otherwise, the returned object will be in the floating time
  zone.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>DateTime-&gt;last_day_of_month( ... )</i></p>
<p class="Pp">This constructor takes the same arguments as can be given to the
    <span class="Li">&quot;new()&quot;</span> method, except for
    &quot;day&quot;. Additionally, both &quot;year&quot; and &quot;month&quot;
    are required.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>DateTime-&gt;from_day_of_year( ... )</i></p>
<p class="Pp">This constructor takes the same arguments as can be given to the
    <span class="Li">&quot;new()&quot;</span> method, except that it does not
    accept a &quot;month&quot; or &quot;day&quot; argument. Instead, it requires
    both &quot;year&quot; and &quot;day_of_year&quot;. The day of year must be
    between 1 and 366, and 366 is only allowed for leap years.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i></i><i>$dt</i><i>-&gt;</i><b><i>clone()</i></b><i></i></p>

    leap seconds.</p>
<p class="Pp">Also available as
    <span class="Li">&quot;$dt-&gt;sec()&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i></i><i>$dt</i><i>-&gt;</i><b><i>fractional_second()</i></b><i></i></p>
<p class="Pp">Returns the second, as a real number from 0.0 until
  61.999999999</p>
<p class="Pp">The values 60 and 61 are used for leap seconds.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i></i><i>$dt</i><i>-&gt;</i><b><i>millisecond()</i></b><i></i></p>
<p class="Pp">Returns the fractional part of the second as milliseconds (1E-3
    seconds).</p>
<p class="Pp">Half a second is 500 milliseconds.</p>
<p class="Pp">This value will always be rounded down to the nearest integer.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i></i><i>$dt</i><i>-&gt;</i><b><i>microsecond()</i></b><i></i></p>
<p class="Pp">Returns the fractional part of the second as microseconds (1E-6
    seconds).</p>
<p class="Pp">Half a second is 500_000 microseconds.</p>
<p class="Pp">This value will always be rounded down to the nearest integer.</p>

<p class="Pp">Also available as
    <span class="Li">&quot;$dt-&gt;time()&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i></i><i>$dt</i><i>-&gt;datetime(
    </i><i>$optional_separator</i><i> )</i></p>
<p class="Pp">This method is equivalent to:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  $dt-&gt;ymd('-') . 'T' . $dt-&gt;hms(':')
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">$optional_separator</span> parameter allows
    you to override the separator between the date and time, for e.g.
    <span class="Li">&quot;$dt-&gt;datetime(q{ })&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">This method is also available as
    <span class="Li">&quot;$dt-&gt;iso8601()&quot;</span>, but it's not really a
    very good ISO8601 format, as it lacks a time zone. If called as
    <span class="Li">&quot;$dt-&gt;iso8601()&quot;</span> you cannot change the
    separator, as ISO8601 specifies that &quot;T&quot; must be used to separate
    them.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i></i><i>$dt</i><i>-&gt;</i><b><i>stringify()</i></b><i></i></p>
<p class="Pp">This method returns a stringified version of the object. It is how
    stringification overloading is implemented. If the object has a formatter,
    then its <span class="Li">&quot;format_datetime()&quot;</span> method is
    used to produce a string. Otherwise, this method calls
    <span class="Li">&quot;$dt-&gt;iso8601()&quot;</span> to produce a string.
    See &quot;Formatters And Stringification&quot; for details.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i></i><i>$dt</i><i>-&gt;</i><b><i>is_leap_year()</i></b><i></i></p>
<p class="Pp">This method returns a true or false value indicating whether or
    not the datetime object is in a leap year.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i></i><i>$dt</i><i>-&gt;</i><b><i>is_last_day_of_month()</i></b><i></i></p>
<p class="Pp">This method returns a true or false value indicating whether or
    not the datetime object is the last day of the month.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i></i><i>$dt</i><i>-&gt;</i><b><i>is_last_day_of_quarter()</i></b><i></i></p>
<p class="Pp">This method returns a true or false value indicating whether or
    not the datetime object is the last day of the quarter.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i></i><i>$dt</i><i>-&gt;</i><b><i>is_last_day_of_year()</i></b><i></i></p>
<p class="Pp">This method returns a true or false value indicating whether or
    not the datetime object is the last day of the year.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i></i><i>$dt</i><i>-&gt;</i><b><i>month_length()</i></b><i></i></p>
<p class="Pp">This method returns the number of days in the current month.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i></i><i>$dt</i><i>-&gt;</i><b><i>quarter_length()</i></b><i></i></p>
<p class="Pp">This method returns the number of days in the current quarter.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i></i><i>$dt</i><i>-&gt;</i><b><i>year_length()</i></b><i></i></p>
<p class="Pp">This method returns the number of days in the current year.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i></i><i>$dt</i><i>-&gt;</i><b><i>week()</i></b><i></i></p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
 ($week_year, $week_number) = $dt-&gt;week;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Returns information about the calendar week which contains this
    datetime object. The values returned by this method are also available
    separately through the week_year and week_number methods.</p>
<p class="Pp">The first week of the year is defined by ISO as the one which
    contains the fourth day of January, which is equivalent to saying that it's
    the first week to overlap the new year by at least four days.</p>
<p class="Pp">Typically the week year will be the same as the year that the
    object is in, but dates at the very beginning of a calendar year often end
    up in the last week of the prior year, and similarly, the final few days of
    the year may be placed in the first week of the next year.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i></i><i>$dt</i><i>-&gt;</i><b><i>week_year()</i></b><i></i></p>
<p class="Pp">Returns the year of the week. See
    <span class="Li">&quot;$dt-&gt;week()&quot;</span> for details.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i></i><i>$dt</i><i>-&gt;</i><b><i>week_number()</i></b><i></i></p>
<p class="Pp">Returns the week of the year, from 1..53. See
    <span class="Li">&quot;$dt-&gt;week()&quot;</span> for details.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i></i><i>$dt</i><i>-&gt;</i><b><i>week_of_month()</i></b><i></i></p>
<p class="Pp">The week of the month, from 0..5. The first week of the month is
    the first week that contains a Thursday. This is based on the ICU definition
    of week of month, and correlates to the ISO8601 week of year definition. A
    day in the week <i>before</i> the week with the first Thursday will be week
    0.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i></i><i>$dt</i><i>-&gt;</i><b><i>jd()</i></b><i>,
    </i><i>$dt</i><i>-&gt;</i><b><i>mjd()</i></b><i></i></p>
<p class="Pp">These return the Julian Day and Modified Julian Day, respectively.
    The value returned is a floating point number. The fractional portion of the
    number represents the time portion of the datetime.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i></i><i>$dt</i><i>-&gt;</i><b><i>time_zone()</i></b><i></i></p>
<p class="Pp">This returns the
    <span class="Li">&quot;DateTime::TimeZone&quot;</span> object for the
    datetime object.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i></i><i>$dt</i><i>-&gt;</i><b><i>offset()</i></b><i></i></p>
<p class="Pp">This returns the offset from UTC, in seconds, of the datetime
    object according to the time zone.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i></i><i>$dt</i><i>-&gt;</i><b><i>is_dst()</i></b><i></i></p>
<p class="Pp">Returns a boolean indicating whether or not the datetime object is
    currently in Daylight Saving Time or not.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i></i><i>$dt</i><i>-&gt;</i><b><i>time_zone_long_name()</i></b><i></i></p>
<p class="Pp">This is a shortcut for
    <span class="Li">&quot;$dt-&gt;time_zone-&gt;name&quot;</span>. It's
    provided so that one can use &quot;%{time_zone_long_name}&quot; as a
    strftime format specifier.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i></i><i>$dt</i><i>-&gt;</i><b><i>time_zone_short_name()</i></b><i></i></p>
<p class="Pp">This method returns the time zone abbreviation for the current
    time zone, such as &quot;PST&quot; or &quot;GMT&quot;. These names are
    <b>not</b> definitive, and should not be used in any application intended
    for general use by users around the world.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i></i><i>$dt</i><i>-&gt;strftime( </i><i>$format</i><i>, ...
    )</i></p>
<p class="Pp">This method implements functionality similar to the
    <span class="Li">&quot;strftime()&quot;</span> method in C. However, if
    given multiple format strings, then it will return multiple scalars, one for
    each format string.</p>
<p class="Pp">See the &quot;strftime Patterns&quot; section for a list of all
    possible strftime patterns.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you give a pattern that doesn't exist, then it is simply
    treated as text.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that any deviation from the POSIX standard is probably a bug.
    DateTime should match the output of
    <span class="Li">&quot;POSIX::strftime&quot;</span> for any given
  pattern.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i></i><i>$dt</i><i>-&gt;format_cldr( </i><i>$format</i><i>, ...
    )</i></p>
<p class="Pp">This method implements formatting based on the CLDR date patterns.
    If given multiple format strings, then it will return multiple scalars, one
    for each format string.</p>
<p class="Pp">See the &quot;CLDR Patterns&quot; section for a list of all
    possible CLDR patterns.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you give a pattern that doesn't exist, then it is simply
    treated as text.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i></i><i>$dt</i><i>-&gt;</i><b><i>epoch()</i></b><i></i></p>
<p class="Pp">Returns the UTC epoch value for the datetime object. DateTimes
    before the start of the epoch will be returned as a negative number.</p>
<p class="Pp">The return value from this method is always an integer number of
    seconds.</p>
<p class="Pp">Since the epoch does not account for leap seconds, the epoch time
    for 1972-12-31T23:59:60 (UTC) is exactly the same as that for
    1973-01-01T00:00:00.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i></i><i>$dt</i><i>-&gt;</i><b><i>hires_epoch()</i></b><i></i></p>
<p class="Pp">Returns the epoch as a floating point number. The floating point
    portion of the value represents the nanosecond value of the object. This
    method is provided for compatibility with the
    <span class="Li">&quot;Time::HiRes&quot;</span> module.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that this method suffers from the imprecision of floating
    point numbers, and the result may end up rounded to an arbitrary degree
    depending on your platform.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    my $dt = DateTime-&gt;new( year =&gt; 2012, nanosecond =&gt; 4 );
    say $dt-&gt;hires_epoch();
</pre>
<p class="Pp">On my system, this simply prints
    <span class="Li">1325376000</span> because adding
    <span class="Li">0.000000004</span> to <span class="Li">1325376000</span>
    returns <span class="Li">1325376000</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i></i><i>$dt</i><i>-&gt;</i><b><i>is_finite()</i></b><i>,
    </i><i>$dt</i><i>-&gt;</i><b><i>is_infinite()</i></b><i></i></p>
<p class="Pp">These methods allow you to distinguish normal datetime objects
    from infinite ones. Infinite datetime objects are documented in
    DateTime::Infinite.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i></i><i>$dt</i><i>-&gt;</i><b><i>utc_rd_values()</i></b><i></i></p>
<p class="Pp">Returns the current UTC Rata Die days, seconds, and nanoseconds as
    a three element list. This exists primarily to allow other calendar modules
    to create objects based on the values provided by this object.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i></i><i>$dt</i><i>-&gt;</i><b><i>local_rd_values()</i></b><i></i></p>
<p class="Pp">Returns the current local Rata Die days, seconds, and nanoseconds
    as a three element list. This exists for the benefit of other modules which
    might want to use this information for date math, such as
    <span class="Li">&quot;DateTime::Event::Recurrence&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i></i><i>$dt</i><i>-&gt;</i><b><i>leap_seconds()</i></b><i></i></p>
<p class="Pp">Returns the number of leap seconds that have happened up to the
    datetime represented by the object. For floating datetimes, this always
    returns 0.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i></i><i>$dt</i><i>-&gt;</i><b><i>utc_rd_as_seconds()</i></b><i></i></p>
<p class="Pp">Returns the current UTC Rata Die days and seconds purely as
    seconds. This number ignores any fractional seconds stored in the object, as
    well as leap seconds.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i></i><i>$dt</i><i>-&gt;</i><b><i>locale()</i></b><i></i></p>
<p class="Pp">Returns the current locale object.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i></i><i>$dt</i><i>-&gt;</i><b><i>formatter()</i></b><i></i></p>
<p class="Pp">Returns current formatter object or class. See &quot;Formatters
    And Stringification&quot; for details.</p>

  Methods</a></h2>
The remaining methods provided by
  <span class="Li">&quot;DateTime.pm&quot;</span>, except where otherwise
  specified, return the object itself, thus making method chaining possible. For
  example:
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  my $dt = DateTime-&gt;now-&gt;set_time_zone( 'Australia/Sydney' );

  my $first = DateTime
                -&gt;last_day_of_month( year =&gt; 2003, month =&gt; 3 )
                -&gt;add( days =&gt; 1 )
                -&gt;subtract( seconds =&gt; 1 );
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><i></i><i>$dt</i><i>-&gt;set( .. )</i></p>
<p class="Pp">This method can be used to change the local components of a date
    time. This method accepts any parameter allowed by the
    <span class="Li">&quot;new()&quot;</span> method except for
    &quot;locale&quot; or &quot;time_zone&quot;. Use
    <span class="Li">&quot;set_locale()&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;set_time_zone()&quot;</span> for those instead.</p>
<p class="Pp">This method performs parameter validation just like the
    <span class="Li">&quot;new()&quot;</span> method.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Do not use this method to do date math. Use the
    </b><b>&quot;add()&quot;</b><b> and </b><b>&quot;subtract()&quot;</b><b></b>
    <b>methods instead.</b></p>
<p class="Pp"><i></i><i>$dt</i><i>-&gt;</i><b><i>set_year()</i></b><i>,
    </i><i>$dt</i><i>-&gt;</i><b><i>set_month()</i></b><i>, etc.</i></p>
<p class="Pp">DateTime has a <span class="Li">&quot;set_*&quot;</span> method
    for every item that can be passed to the constructor:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li><span class="Li">$dt</span>-&gt;<b>set_year()</b></li>
  <li><span class="Li">$dt</span>-&gt;<b>set_month()</b></li>
  <li><span class="Li">$dt</span>-&gt;<b>set_day()</b></li>
  <li><span class="Li">$dt</span>-&gt;<b>set_hour()</b></li>
  <li><span class="Li">$dt</span>-&gt;<b>set_minute()</b></li>
  <li><span class="Li">$dt</span>-&gt;<b>set_second()</b></li>
  <li><span class="Li">$dt</span>-&gt;<b>set_nanosecond()</b></li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">These are shortcuts to calling
    <span class="Li">&quot;set()&quot;</span> with a single key. They all take a
    single parameter.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i></i><i>$dt</i><i>-&gt;truncate( to =&gt; ... )</i></p>
<p class="Pp">This method allows you to reset some of the local time components
    in the object to their &quot;zero&quot; values. The &quot;to&quot; parameter
    is used to specify which values to truncate, and it may be one of
    &quot;year&quot;, &quot;quarter&quot;, &quot;month&quot;, &quot;week&quot;,
    &quot;local_week&quot;, &quot;day&quot;, &quot;hour&quot;,
    &quot;minute&quot;, or &quot;second&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, if &quot;month&quot; is specified, then the local day
    becomes 1, and the hour, minute, and second all become 0.</p>
<p class="Pp">If &quot;week&quot; is given, then the datetime is set to the
    Monday of the week in which it occurs, and the time components are all set
    to 0. If you truncate to &quot;local_week&quot;, then the first day of the
    week is locale-dependent. For example, in the

  $dt-&gt;set_time_zone( 'America/Chicago' );

  print $dt-&gt;hour; # prints 17
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If the old time zone was a floating time zone, then no adjustments
    to the local time are made, except to account for leap seconds. If the new

    leave the local time untouched.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="How_DateTime_Math_Works"><a class="permalink" href="#How_DateTime_Math_Works">How
  DateTime Math Works</a></h2>
It's important to have some understanding of how datetime math is implemented in
  order to effectively use this module and
  <span class="Li">&quot;DateTime::Duration&quot;</span>.
<p class="Pp"><i>Making Things Simple</i></p>
<p class="Pp">If you want to simplify your life and not have to think too hard
    about the nitty-gritty of datetime math, I have several recommendations:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>use the floating time zone
    <p class="Pp">If you do not care about time zones or leap seconds, use the
        &quot;floating&quot; timezone:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
  my $dt = DateTime-&gt;now( time_zone =&gt; 'floating' );
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Math done on two objects in the floating time zone produces
        very predictable results.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that in most cases you will want to start by creating an
        object in a specific zone and <i>then</i> convert it to the floating
        time zone. When an object goes from a real zone to the floating zone,
        the time for the object remains the same.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This means that passing the floating zone to a constructor may
        not do what you want.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
  my $dt = DateTime-&gt;now( time_zone =&gt; 'floating' );
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">is equivalent to</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
  my $dt = DateTime-&gt;now( time_zone =&gt; 'UTC' )-&gt;set_time_zone('floating');
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This might not be what you wanted. Instead, you may prefer to
        do this:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
  my $dt = DateTime-&gt;now( time_zone =&gt; 'local' )-&gt;set_time_zone('floating');
    </pre>
  </li>
  <li>use UTC for all calculations
    <p class="Pp">If you do care about time zones (particularly DST) or leap
        seconds, try to use non-UTC time zones for presentation and user input
        only. Convert to UTC immediately and convert back to the local time zone
        for presentation:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
  my $dt = DateTime-&gt;new( %user_input, time_zone =&gt; $user_tz );
  $dt-&gt;set_time_zone('UTC');

  # do various operations - store it, retrieve it, add, subtract, etc.

  $dt-&gt;set_time_zone($user_tz);
  print $dt-&gt;datetime;
    </pre>
  </li>
  <li>math on non-UTC time zones
    <p class="Pp">If you need to do date math on objects with non-UTC time
        zones, please read the caveats below carefully. The results
        <span class="Li">&quot;DateTime.pm&quot;</span> produces are predictable
        and correct, and mostly intuitive, but datetime math gets very ugly when
        time zones are involved, and there are a few strange corner cases
        involving subtraction of two datetimes across a DST change.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you can always use the floating or UTC time zones, you can
        skip ahead to &quot;Leap Seconds and Date Math&quot;</p>
  </li>
  <li>date vs datetime math
    <p class="Pp">If you only care about the date (calendar) portion of a
        datetime, you should use either
        <span class="Li">&quot;delta_md()&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;delta_days()&quot;</span>, not
        <span class="Li">&quot;subtract_datetime()&quot;</span>. This will give
        predictable, unsurprising results, free from DST-related
      complications.</p>
  </li>
  <li><b>subtract_datetime()</b> and <b>add_duration()</b>
    <p class="Pp">You must convert your datetime objects to the UTC time zone
        before doing date math if you want to make sure that the following
        formulas are always true:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
  $dt2 - $dt1 = $dur
  $dt1 + $dur = $dt2
  $dt2 - $dur = $dt1
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Note that using <span class="Li">&quot;delta_days&quot;</span>
        ensures that this formula always works, regardless of the timezone of
        the objects involved, as does using
        <span class="Li">&quot;subtract_datetime_absolute()&quot;</span>. Other
        methods of subtraction are not always reversible.</p>
  </li>
  <li>never do math on two objects where only one is in the floating time zone
    <p class="Pp">The date math code accounts for leap seconds whenever the
        <span class="Li">&quot;DateTime&quot;</span> object is not in the
        floating time zone. If you try to do math where one object is in the
        floating zone and the other isn't, the results will be confusing and
        wrong.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp"><i>Adding a Duration to a DateTime</i></p>
<p class="Pp">The parts of a duration can be broken down into five parts. These
    are months, days, minutes, seconds, and nanoseconds. Adding one month to a
    date is different than adding 4 weeks or 28, 29, 30, or 31 days. Similarly,
    due to DST and leap seconds, adding a day can be different than adding
    86,400 seconds, and adding a minute is not exactly the same as 60
  seconds.</p>
<p class="Pp">We cannot convert between these units, except for seconds and
    nanoseconds, because there is no fixed conversion between the two units,
    because of things like leap seconds, DST changes, etc.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;DateTime.pm&quot;</span> always adds (or
    subtracts) days, then months, minutes, and then seconds and nanoseconds. If
    there are any boundary overflows, these are normalized at each step. For the
    days and months the local (not UTC) values are used. For minutes and
    seconds, the local values are used. This generally just works.</p>
<p class="Pp">This means that adding one month and one day to February 28, 2003
    will produce the date April 1, 2003, not March 29, 2003.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  my $dt = DateTime-&gt;new( year =&gt; 2003, month =&gt; 2, day =&gt; 28 );

  $dt-&gt;add( months =&gt; 1, days =&gt; 1 );

  # 2003-04-01 - the result
</pre>
<p class="Pp">On the other hand, if we add months first, and then separately add
    days, we end up with March 29, 2003:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  $dt-&gt;add( months =&gt; 1 )-&gt;add( days =&gt; 1 );

  # 2003-03-29
</pre>
<p class="Pp">We see similar strangeness when math crosses a DST boundary:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  my $dt = DateTime-&gt;new(
      year      =&gt; 2003,
      month     =&gt; 4,
      day       =&gt; 5,
      hour      =&gt; 1,
      minute    =&gt; 58,
      time_zone =&gt; &quot;America/Chicago&quot;,
  );

  $dt-&gt;add( days =&gt; 1, minutes =&gt; 3 );
  # 2003-04-06 02:01:00

  $dt-&gt;add( minutes =&gt; 3 )-&gt;add( days =&gt; 1 );
  # 2003-04-06 03:01:00
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Note that if you converted the datetime object to UTC first you
    would get predictable results.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you want to know how many seconds a duration object represents,
    you have to add it to a datetime to find out, so you could do:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
 my $now = DateTime-&gt;now( time_zone =&gt; 'UTC' );
 my $later = $now-&gt;clone-&gt;add_duration($duration);

 my $seconds_dur = $later-&gt;subtract_datetime_absolute($now);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This returns a duration which only contains seconds and
    nanoseconds.</p>
<p class="Pp">If we were add the duration to a different datetime object we
    might get a different number of seconds.</p>
<p class="Pp">DateTime::Duration supports three different end-of-month
    algorithms for adding months. This comes into play when an addition results
    in a day past the end of the month (for example, adding one month to January
    30).</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
 # 2010-08-31 + 1 month = 2010-10-01
 $dt-&gt;add( months =&gt; 1, end_of_month =&gt; 'wrap' );

 # 2010-01-30 + 1 month = 2010-02-28
 $dt-&gt;add( months =&gt; 1, end_of_month =&gt; 'limit' );

 # 2010-04-30 + 1 month = 2010-05-31
 $dt-&gt;add( months =&gt; 1, end_of_month =&gt; 'preserve' );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">By default, it uses &quot;wrap&quot; for positive durations and
    &quot;preserve&quot; for negative durations. See DateTime::Duration for a
    detailed explanation of these algorithms.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you need to do lots of work with durations, take a look at Rick
    Measham's <span class="Li">&quot;DateTime::Format::Duration&quot;</span>
    module, which lets you present information from durations in many useful
    ways.</p>
<p class="Pp">There are other subtract/delta methods in DateTime.pm to generate
    different types of durations. These methods are
    <span class="Li">&quot;subtract_datetime()&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;subtract_datetime_absolute()&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;delta_md()&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;delta_days()&quot;</span>, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;delta_ms()&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>DateTime Subtraction</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Date subtraction is done solely based on the two object's local
    datetimes, with one exception to handle DST changes. Also, if the two
    datetime objects are in different time zones, one of them is converted to
    the other's time zone first before subtraction. This is best explained
    through examples:</p>
<p class="Pp">The first of these probably makes the most sense:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  my $dt1 = DateTime-&gt;new(
      year      =&gt; 2003,
      month     =&gt; 5,
      day       =&gt; 6,
      time_zone =&gt; 'America/Chicago',
  );

  # not DST

  my $dt2 = DateTime-&gt;new(
      year      =&gt; 2003,
      month     =&gt; 11,
      day       =&gt; 6,
      time_zone =&gt; 'America/Chicago',
  );

  # is DST

  my $dur = $dt2-&gt;subtract_datetime($dt1);
  # 6 months
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Nice and simple.</p>
<p class="Pp">This one is a little trickier, but still fairly logical:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  my $dt1 = DateTime-&gt;new(
      year      =&gt; 2003,
      month     =&gt; 4,
      day       =&gt; 5,
      hour      =&gt; 1,
      minute    =&gt; 58,
      time_zone =&gt; &quot;America/Chicago&quot;,
  );

  # is DST

<p class="Pp">Which contradicts the result this one gives, even though they both

  my $dur = $dt2-&gt;subtract_datetime($dt1);

  # 1 day and 3 minutes
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This last example illustrates the &quot;DST&quot; exception
    mentioned earlier. The exception accounts for the fact 2003-04-06 only lasts
    23 hours.</p>
<p class="Pp">And finally:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  my $dt2 = DateTime-&gt;new(
      year      =&gt; 2003,
      month     =&gt; 10,
      day       =&gt; 26,

  );

  my $dt1 = $dt2-&gt;clone-&gt;subtract( hours =&gt; 1 );

  my $dur = $dt2-&gt;subtract_datetime($dt1);
  # 60 minutes
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This seems obvious until you realize that subtracting 60 minutes
    from <span class="Li">$dt2</span> in the above example still leaves the
    clock time at &quot;01:00:00&quot;. This time we are accounting for a 25
    hour day.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Reversibility</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Date math operations are not always reversible. This is because of
    the way that addition operations are ordered. As was discussed earlier,
    adding 1 day and 3 minutes in one call to
    <span class="Li">&quot;add()&quot;</span> is not the same as first adding 3
    minutes and 1 day in two separate calls.</p>
<p class="Pp">If we take a duration returned from
    <span class="Li">&quot;subtract_datetime()&quot;</span> and then try to add
    or subtract that duration from one of the datetimes we just used, we
    sometimes get interesting results:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  my $dt1 = DateTime-&gt;new(
      year      =&gt; 2003,
      month     =&gt; 4,
      day       =&gt; 5,
      hour      =&gt; 1,
      minute    =&gt; 58,
      time_zone =&gt; &quot;America/Chicago&quot;,
  );

  my $dt2 = DateTime-&gt;new(

      hour      =&gt; 3,
      minute    =&gt; 1,
      time_zone =&gt; &quot;America/Chicago&quot;,
  );

  my $dur = $dt2-&gt;subtract_datetime($dt1);
  # 1 day and 3 minutes

  $dt1-&gt;add_duration($dur);
  # gives us $dt2

  $dt2-&gt;subtract_duration($dur);
  # gives us 2003-04-05 02:58:00 - 1 hour later than $dt1
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;subtract_duration()&quot;</span>
    operation gives us a (perhaps) unexpected answer because it first subtracts
    one day to get 2003-04-05T03:01:00 and then subtracts 3 minutes to get the
    final result.</p>
<p class="Pp">If we explicitly reverse the order we can get the original value
    of <span class="Li">$dt1</span>. This can be facilitated by
    <span class="Li">&quot;DateTime::Duration&quot;</span>'s
    <span class="Li">&quot;calendar_duration()&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;clock_duration()&quot;</span> methods:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>

  $dt2-&gt;subtract_duration( $dur-&gt;clock_duration )
      -&gt;subtract_duration( $dur-&gt;calendar_duration );
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><i>Leap Seconds and Date Math</i></p>
<p class="Pp">The presence of leap seconds can cause even more anomalies in date
    math. For example, the following is a legal datetime:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  my $dt = DateTime-&gt;new(
      year      =&gt; 1972,
      month     =&gt; 12,
      day       =&gt; 31,
      hour      =&gt; 23,
      minute    =&gt; 59,
      second    =&gt; 60,
      time_zone =&gt; 'UTC'
  );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If we do the following:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
 $dt-&gt;add( months =&gt; 1 );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Then the datetime is now &quot;1973-02-01 00:00:00&quot;, because
    there is no 23:59:60 on 1973-01-31.</p>
<p class="Pp">Leap seconds also force us to distinguish between minutes and
    seconds during date math. Given the following datetime:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  my $dt = DateTime-&gt;new(
      year      =&gt; 1972,
      month     =&gt; 12,
      day       =&gt; 31,
      hour      =&gt; 23,
      minute    =&gt; 59,
      second    =&gt; 30,
      time_zone =&gt; 'UTC'
  );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">we will get different results when adding 1 minute than we get if
    we add 60 seconds. This is because in this case, the last minute of the day,
    beginning at 23:59:00, actually contains 61 seconds.</p>
<p class="Pp">Here are the results we get:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  # 1972-12-31 23:59:30 - our starting datetime

  $dt-&gt;clone-&gt;add( minutes =&gt; 1 );
  # 1973-01-01 00:00:30 - one minute later

  $dt-&gt;clone-&gt;add( seconds =&gt; 60 );
  # 1973-01-01 00:00:29 - 60 seconds later

  $dt-&gt;clone-&gt;add( seconds =&gt; 61 );
  # 1973-01-01 00:00:30 - 61 seconds later
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><i>Local vs. UTC and 24 hours vs. 1 day</i></p>
<p class="Pp">When math crosses a daylight saving boundary, a single day may
    have more or less than 24 hours.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, if you do this:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  my $dt = DateTime-&gt;new(
      year      =&gt; 2003,
      month     =&gt; 4,
      day       =&gt; 5,
      hour      =&gt; 2,
      time_zone =&gt; 'America/Chicago',
  );

  $dt-&gt;add( days =&gt; 1 );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">then you will produce an <i>invalid</i> local time, and therefore
    an exception will be thrown.</p>
<p class="Pp">However, this works:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  my $dt = DateTime-&gt;new(
      year      =&gt; 2003,
      month     =&gt; 4,
      day       =&gt; 5,
      hour      =&gt; 2,
      time_zone =&gt; 'America/Chicago',
  );

  $dt-&gt;add( hours =&gt; 24 );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">and produces a datetime with the local time of
  &quot;03:00&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">If all this makes your head hurt, there is a simple alternative.
    Just convert your datetime object to the &quot;UTC&quot; time zone before
    doing date math on it, and switch it back to the local time zone afterwards.
    This avoids the possibility of having date math throw an exception, and
    makes sure that 1 day equals 24 hours. Of course, this may not always be
    desirable, so caveat user!</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Overloading"><a class="permalink" href="#Overloading">Overloading</a></h2>
This module explicitly overloads the addition (+), subtraction (-), string and
  numeric comparison operators. This means that the following all do sensible
  things:
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  my $new_dt = $dt + $duration_obj;

  my $new_dt = $dt - $duration_obj;

  my $duration_obj = $dt - $new_dt;

  foreach my $dt ( sort @dts ) { ... }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Additionally, the fallback parameter is set to true, so other
    derivable operators (+=, -=, etc.) will work properly. Do not expect
    increment (++) or decrement (--) to do anything useful.</p>
<p class="Pp">The string comparison operators,
    <span class="Li">&quot;eq&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;ne&quot;</span>, will use the string value to compare
    with non-DateTime objects.</p>
<p class="Pp">DateTime objects do not have a numeric value, using
    <span class="Li">&quot;==&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;=&gt;&quot;</span> to compare a DateTime object
    with a non-DateTime object will result in an exception. To safely sort mixed
    DateTime and non-DateTime objects, use <span class="Li">&quot;sort { $a cmp
    $b } @dates&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The module also overloads stringification using the object's
    formatter, defaulting to <span class="Li">&quot;iso8601()&quot;</span>
    method. See &quot;Formatters And Stringification&quot; for details.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Formatters_And_Stringification"><a class="permalink" href="#Formatters_And_Stringification">Formatters
  And Stringification</a></h2>
You can optionally specify a &quot;formatter&quot;, which is usually a
  DateTime::Format::* object/class, to control the stringification of the
  DateTime object.
<p class="Pp">Any of the constructor methods can accept a formatter
  argument:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  my $formatter = DateTime::Format::Strptime-&gt;new(...);
  my $dt = DateTime-&gt;new(year =&gt; 2004, formatter =&gt; $formatter);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Or, you can set it afterwards:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  $dt-&gt;set_formatter($formatter);
  $formatter = $dt-&gt;formatter();
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Once you set the formatter, the overloaded stringification method
    will use the formatter. If unspecified, the
    <span class="Li">&quot;iso8601()&quot;</span> method is used.</p>
<p class="Pp">A formatter can be handy when you know that in your application
    you want to stringify your DateTime objects into a special format all the
    time, for example to a different language.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you provide a formatter class name or object, it must implement
    a <span class="Li">&quot;format_datetime&quot;</span> method. This method
    will be called with just the DateTime object as its argument.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="_s-1CLDR_s0_Patterns"><a class="permalink" href="#_s-1CLDR_s0_Patterns">CLDR
  Patterns</a></h2>
The CLDR pattern language is both more powerful and more complex than strftime.
  Unlike strftime patterns, you often have to explicitly escape text that you do
  not want formatted, as the patterns are simply letters without any prefix.
<p class="Pp">For example, &quot;yyyy-MM-dd&quot; is a valid CLDR pattern. If
    you want to include any lower or upper case ASCII characters as-is, you can
    surround them with single quotes ('). If you want to include a single quote,
    you must escape it as two single quotes ('').</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  'Today is ' EEEE
  'It is now' h 'o''clock' a
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Spaces and any non-letter text will always be passed through
    as-is.</p>
<p class="Pp">Many CLDR patterns which produce numbers will pad the number with
    leading zeroes depending on the length of the format specifier. For example,
    &quot;h&quot; represents the current hour from 1-12. If you specify
    &quot;hh&quot; then the 1-9 will have a leading zero prepended.</p>
<p class="Pp">However, CLDR often uses five of a letter to represent the narrow
    form of a pattern. This inconsistency is necessary for backwards
    compatibility.</p>
<p class="Pp">CLDR often distinguishes between the &quot;format&quot; and
    &quot;stand-alone&quot; forms of a pattern. The format pattern is used when
    the thing in question is being placed into a larger string. The stand-alone
    form is used when displaying that item by itself, for example in a
  calendar.</p>
<p class="Pp">It also often provides three sizes for each item, wide (the full
    name), abbreviated, and narrow. The narrow form is often just a single
    character, for example &quot;T&quot; for &quot;Tuesday&quot;, and may not be
    unique.</p>
<p class="Pp">CLDR provides a fairly complex system for localizing time zones
    that we ignore entirely. The time zone patterns just use the information
    provided by <span class="Li">&quot;DateTime::TimeZone&quot;</span>, and
    <i>do not follow the CLDR spec</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The output of a CLDR pattern is always localized, when
  applicable.</p>
<p class="Pp">CLDR provides the following patterns:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>G{1,3}
    <p class="Pp">The abbreviated era (BC, AD).</p>
  </li>
  <li>GGGG
    <p class="Pp">The wide era (Before Christ, Anno Domini).</p>
  </li>
  <li>GGGGG
    <p class="Pp">The narrow era, if it exists (and it mostly doesn't).</p>
  </li>
  <li>y and y{3,}
    <p class="Pp">The year, zero-prefixed as needed. Negative years will start
        with a &quot;-&quot;, and this will be included in the length
        calculation.</p>
    <p class="Pp">In other, words the &quot;yyyyy&quot; pattern will format year
        -1234 as &quot;-1234&quot;, not &quot;-01234&quot;.</p>
  </li>
  <li>yy
    <p class="Pp">This is a special case. It always produces a two-digit year,
        so &quot;1976&quot; becomes &quot;76&quot;. Negative years will start
        with a &quot;-&quot;, making them one character longer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Y{1,}
    <p class="Pp">The year in &quot;week of the year&quot; calendars, from

  BUGS</a></h1>
The tests in <i>20infinite.t</i> seem to fail on some machines, particularly on
  Win32. This appears to be related to Perl's internal handling of IEEE infinity
  and NaN, and seems to be highly platform/compiler/phase of moon dependent.
<p class="Pp">If you don't plan to use infinite datetimes you can probably
    ignore this. This will be fixed (perhaps) in future versions.</p>
