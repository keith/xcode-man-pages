   Set up some character translations and predefined strings.  \*(-- will
   give an unbreakable dash, \*(PI will give pi, \*(L" will give a left
   double quote, and \*(R" will give a right double quote.  \*(C+ will
   give a nicer C++.  Capital omega is used to do unbreakable dashes and
   therefore won't be available.  \*(C` and \*(C' expand to `' in nroff,
   nothing in troff, for use with C<>.

  Heap buffer overflow in regular expression compiler</a></h2>
Compiling certain regular expression patterns with the case-insensitive modifier
  could cause a heap buffer overflow and crash perl. This has now been fixed.

  <li>Several built-in functions previously had bugs that could cause them to
      write to the internal stack without allocating room for the item being
      written. In rare situations, this could have led to a crash. These bugs
      have now been fixed, and if any similar bugs are introduced in future,
      they will be detected automatically in debugging builds. [perl #131732]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=131732&gt;</li>
  <li>Using a symbolic ref with postderef syntax as the key in a hash lookup was

  <li>Attempting to apply an attribute to an

  <li>The <span class="Li">&quot;jmpenv&quot;</span> frame to catch Perl
