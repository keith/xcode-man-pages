  <li>Several built-in functions previously had bugs that could cause them to
      write to the internal stack without allocating room for the item being
      written. In rare situations, this could have led to a crash. These bugs
      have now been fixed, and if any similar bugs are introduced in future,
      they will be detected automatically in debugging builds. [GH #16076]
      &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16076&gt;</li>
  <li>Using a symbolic ref with postderef syntax as the key in a hash lookup was
      yielding an assertion failure on debugging builds. [GH #16029]
      &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16029&gt;</li>
  <li>List assignment (<span class="Li">&quot;aassign&quot;</span>) could in

      uninitialized. [GH #16017]
      &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16017&gt;</li>
  <li>Attempting to apply an attribute to an
      <span class="Li">&quot;our&quot;</span> variable where a function of that
      name already exists could result in a NULL pointer being supplied where an
      SV was expected, crashing perl. [perl #131597]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=131597&gt;</li>
  <li>The code that vivifies a typeglob out of a code ref made some false
      assumptions that could lead to a crash in cases such as
      <span class="Li">$::{&quot;A&quot;} = sub {};
      \&amp;{&quot;A&quot;}</span>. This has now been fixed. [GH #15937]

      immediately before the NUL. [GH #16002]

  <li>Occasional &quot;Malformed UTF-8 character&quot; crashes in

  <li>Some erroneous warnings after utf8 conversion have been fixed. [GH #15958]
      &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/15958&gt;</li>
  <li>The <span class="Li">&quot;jmpenv&quot;</span> frame to catch Perl
      exceptions is set up lazily, and this used to be a bit too lazy. The
      catcher is now set up earlier, preventing some possible crashes. [GH
      #11804] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/11804&gt;</li>
  <li>Spurious &quot;Assuming NOT a POSIX class&quot; warnings have been
