The target is to make OS/2 one of the best supported platform for
  using/building/developing Perl and <i>Perl applications</i>, as well as make
  Perl the best language to use under OS/2. The secondary target is to try to
  make this work under DOS and Win* as well (but not <b>too</b> hard).
<p class="Pp">The current state is quite close to this target. Known
    limitations:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Some *nix programs use <b>fork()</b> a lot; with the mostly useful flavors
      of perl for OS/2 (there are several built simultaneously) this is
      supported; but some flavors do not support this (e.g., when Perl is called
      from inside REXX). Using <b>fork()</b> after <i>use</i>ing dynamically
      loading extensions would not work with <i>very</i> old versions of
    EMX.</li>
  <li>You need a separate perl executable <i>perl__.exe</i> (see
      &quot;perl__.exe&quot;) if you want to use PM code in your application (as
      Perl/Tk or OpenGL Perl modules do) without having a text-mode window
      present.
    <p class="Pp">While using the standard <i>perl.exe</i> from a text-mode
        window is possible too, I have seen cases when this causes degradation
        of the system stability. Using <i>perl__.exe</i> avoids such a
        degradation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>There is no simple way to access WPS objects. The only way I know is via
      <span class="Li">&quot;OS2::REXX&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;SOM&quot;</span> extensions (see OS2::REXX, SOM).
      However, we do not have access to convenience methods of Object-REXX. (Is
      it possible at all? I know of no Object-REXX API.) The
      <span class="Li">&quot;SOM&quot;</span> extension (currently in
      alpha-text) may eventually remove this shortcoming; however, due to the
      fact that DII is not supported by the
      <span class="Li">&quot;SOM&quot;</span> module, using
      <span class="Li">&quot;SOM&quot;</span> is not as convenient as one would
      like it.</li>

    items.</p>

Since OS/2 port of perl uses a remarkable EMX environment, it can run (and build
  extensions, and - possibly - be built itself) under any environment which can
  run EMX. The current list is DOS, DOS-inside-OS/2, Win0.3*, Win0.95 and WinNT.
  Out of many perl flavors, only one works, see &quot;<i>perl_.exe</i>&quot;.
<p class="Pp">Note that not all features of Perl are available under these
    environments. This depends on the features the <i>extender</i> - most
    probably RSX - decided to implement.</p>
<p class="Pp">Cf. &quot;Prerequisites&quot;.</p>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>EMX</dt>
  <dd>EMX runtime is required (may be substituted by RSX). Note that it is
      possible to make <i>perl_.exe</i> to run under DOS without any external
      support by binding <i>emx.exe</i>/<i>rsx.exe</i> to it, see
      <span class="Li">&quot;emxbind&quot;</span>. Note that under DOS for best
      results one should use RSX runtime, which has much more functions working
      (like <span class="Li">&quot;fork&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;popen&quot;</span> and so on). In fact RSX is
      required if there is no VCPI present. Note the RSX requires DPMI. Many
      implementations of DPMI are known to be very buggy, beware!
    <p class="Pp">Only the latest runtime is supported, currently
        <span class="Li">&quot;0.9d fix 03&quot;</span>. Perl may run under
        earlier versions of EMX, but this is not tested.</p>
    <p class="Pp">One can get different parts of EMX from, say</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
  ftp://crydee.sai.msu.ru/pub/comp/os/os2/leo/gnu/emx+gcc/
  http://hobbes.nmsu.edu/h-browse.php?dir=/pub/os2/dev/emx/v0.9d/
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The runtime component should have the name
      <i>emxrt.zip</i>.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><b>NOTE</b>. When using <i>emx.exe</i>/<i>rsx.exe</i>, it is
        enough to have them on your path. One does not need to specify them
        explicitly (though this</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
  emx perl_.exe -de 0
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">will work as well.)</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>RSX</dt>
  <dd>To run Perl on DPMI platforms one needs RSX runtime. This is needed under
      DOS-inside-OS/2, Win0.3*, Win0.95 and WinNT (see &quot;Other OSes&quot;).
      RSX would not work with VCPI only, as EMX would, it requires DMPI.
    <p class="Pp">Having RSX and the latest <i>sh.exe</i> one gets a fully
        functional <b>*nix</b>-ish environment under DOS, say,
        <span class="Li">&quot;fork&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;``&quot;</span> and
        pipe-<span class="Li">&quot;open&quot;</span> work. In fact, MakeMaker
        works (for static build), so one can have Perl development environment
        under DOS.</p>

  <dd>Perl does not care about file systems, but the perl library contains many
      files with long names, so to install it intact one needs a file system
      which supports long file names.
    <p class="Pp">Note that if you do not plan to build the perl itself, it may
        be possible to fool EMX to truncate file names. This is not supported,
        read EMX docs to see how to do it.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>pdksh</dt>
  <dd>To start external programs with complicated command lines (like with pipes
      in between, and/or quoting of arguments), Perl uses an external shell.
      With EMX port such shell should be named <i>sh.exe</i>, and located either
      in the wired-in-during-compile locations (usually <i>F:/bin</i>), or in
      configurable location (see
      &quot;<span class="Li">&quot;PERL_SH_DIR&quot;</span>&quot;).
    <p class="Pp">For best results use EMX pdksh. The standard binary (5.2.14 or
        later) runs under DOS (with &quot;RSX&quot;) as well, see</p>

Start your Perl program <i>foo.pl</i> with arguments <span class="Li">&quot;arg1
  arg2 arg3&quot;</span> the same way as on any other platform, by
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
        perl foo.pl arg1 arg2 arg3
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If you want to specify perl options
    <span class="Li">&quot;-my_opts&quot;</span> to the perl itself (as opposed
    to your program), use</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
        perl -my_opts foo.pl arg1 arg2 arg3
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Alternately, if you use OS/2-ish shell, like CMD or 4os2, put the
    following at the start of your perl script:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
        extproc perl -S -my_opts
</pre>
<p class="Pp">rename your program to <i>foo.cmd</i>, and start it by typing</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
        foo arg1 arg2 arg3
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Note that because of stupid OS/2 limitations the full path of the
    perl script is not available when you use
    <span class="Li">&quot;extproc&quot;</span>, thus you are forced to use
    <span class="Li">&quot;-S&quot;</span> perl switch, and your script should
    be on the <span class="Li">&quot;PATH&quot;</span>. As a plus side, if you
    know a full path to your script, you may still start it with</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
        perl ../../blah/foo.cmd arg1 arg2 arg3
</pre>
<p class="Pp">(note that the argument
    <span class="Li">&quot;-my_opts&quot;</span> is taken care of by the
    <span class="Li">&quot;extproc&quot;</span> line in your script, see
    &quot;<span class="Li">&quot;extproc&quot;</span> on the first
  line&quot;).</p>
<p class="Pp">To understand what the above <i>magic</i> does, read perl docs
    about <span class="Li">&quot;-S&quot;</span> switch - see perlrun, and
    cmdref about <span class="Li">&quot;extproc&quot;</span>:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
        view perl perlrun
        man perlrun
        view cmdref extproc
        help extproc
</pre>
<p class="Pp">or whatever method you prefer.</p>
<p class="Pp">There are also endless possibilities to use <i>executable
    extensions</i> of 4os2, <i>associations</i> of WPS and so on... However, if
    you use *nixish shell (like <i>sh.exe</i> supplied in the binary
    distribution), you need to follow the syntax specified in &quot;Command
    Switches&quot; in perlrun.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that <b>-S</b> switch supports scripts with additional
    extensions <i>.cmd</i>, <i>.btm</i>, <i>.bat</i>, <i>.pl</i> as well.</p>

This is what <b>system()</b> (see &quot;system&quot; in perlfunc),
  <span class="Li">&quot;``&quot;</span> (see &quot;I/O Operators&quot; in
  perlop), and <i>open pipe</i> (see &quot;open&quot; in perlfunc) are for.
  (Avoid <b>exec()</b> (see &quot;exec&quot; in perlfunc) unless you know what
  you do).
<p class="Pp">Note however that to use some of these operators you need to have
    a sh-syntax shell installed (see &quot;Pdksh&quot;, &quot;Frequently asked
    questions&quot;), and perl should be able to find it (see
    &quot;<span class="Li">&quot;PERL_SH_DIR&quot;</span>&quot;).</p>
<p class="Pp">The cases when the shell is used are:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>1.</dt>
  <dd>One-argument <b>system()</b> (see &quot;system&quot; in perlfunc),
      <b>exec()</b> (see &quot;exec&quot; in perlfunc) with redirection or shell

  <dd>If the executable called by

  <dt>7.</dt>
  <dd>For globbing (see &quot;glob&quot; in perlfunc, &quot;I/O Operators&quot;
      in perlop) (obsolete? Perl uses builtin globbing nowadays...).</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">For the sake of speed for a common case, in the above algorithms
    backslashes in the command name are not considered as shell
  metacharacters.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl starts scripts which begin with cookies
    <span class="Li">&quot;extproc&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;#!&quot;</span> directly, without an intervention of
    shell. Perl uses the same algorithm to find the executable as <i>pdksh</i>:
    if the path on <span class="Li">&quot;#!&quot;</span> line does not work,
    and contains <span class="Li">&quot;/&quot;</span>, then the directory part
    of the executable is ignored, and the executable is searched in <i>.</i> and
    on <span class="Li">&quot;PATH&quot;</span>. To find arguments for these
    scripts Perl uses a different algorithm than <i>pdksh</i>: up to 3 arguments
    are recognized, and trailing whitespace is stripped.</p>
<p class="Pp">If a script does not contain such a cooky, then to avoid calling
    <i>sh.exe</i>, Perl uses the same algorithm as <i>pdksh</i>: if
    <span class="Li">$ENV{EXECSHELL}</span> is set, the script is given as the
    first argument to this command, if not set, then
    <span class="Li">&quot;$ENV{COMSPEC} /c&quot;</span> is used (or a hardwired
    guess if <span class="Li">$ENV{COMSPEC}</span> is not set).</p>
<p class="Pp">When starting scripts directly, Perl uses exactly the same
    algorithm as for the search of script given by <b>-S</b> command-line
    option: it will look in the current directory, then on components of
    <span class="Li">$ENV{PATH}</span> using the following order of appended
    extensions: no extension, <i>.cmd</i>, <i>.btm</i>, <i>.bat</i>,
  <i>.pl</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that Perl will start to look for scripts only if OS/2 cannot
    start the specified application, thus <span class="Li">&quot;system
    'blah'&quot;</span> will not look for a script if there is an executable
    file <i>blah.exe</i> <i>anywhere</i> on
    <span class="Li">&quot;PATH&quot;</span>. In other words,
    <span class="Li">&quot;PATH&quot;</span> is essentially searched twice: once
    by the OS for an executable, then by Perl for scripts.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note also that executable files on OS/2 can have an arbitrary
    extension, but <i>.exe</i> will be automatically appended if no dot is
    present in the name. The workaround is as simple as that: since <i>blah.</i>
    and <i>blah</i> denote the same file (at list on FAT and HPFS file systems),
    to start an executable residing in file <i>n:/bin/blah</i> (no extension)
    give an argument <span class="Li">&quot;n:/bin/blah.&quot;</span> (dot
    appended) to <b>system()</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl will start PM programs from VIO (=text-mode) Perl process in
    a separate PM session; the opposite is not true: when you start a non-PM
    program from a PM Perl process, Perl would not run it in a separate session.
    If a separate session is desired, either ensure that shell will be used, as
    in <span class="Li">&quot;system 'cmd /c myprog'&quot;</span>, or start it
    using optional arguments to <b>system()</b> documented in
    <span class="Li">&quot;OS2::Process&quot;</span> module. This is considered
    to be a feature.</p>

  understands command arguments. One of such ports is listed in

The most convenient way of installing a binary distribution of perl is via perl
  installer <i>install.exe</i>. Just follow the instructions, and 99% of the
  installation blues would go away.
<p class="Pp">Note however, that you need to have <i>unzip.exe</i> on your path,
    and EMX environment <i>running</i>. The latter means that if you just
    installed EMX, and made all the needed changes to <i>Config.sys</i>, you may
    need to reboot in between. Check EMX runtime by running</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
        emxrev
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Binary installer also creates a folder on your desktop with some
    useful objects. If you need to change some aspects of the work of the binary
    installer, feel free to edit the file <i>Perl.pkg</i>. This may be useful
    e.g., if you need to run the installer many times and do not want to make
    many interactive changes in the GUI.</p>

As of version 5.00305, OS/2 perl binary distribution comes split into 11
  components. Unfortunately, to enable configurable binary installation, the
  file paths in the zip files are not absolute, but relative to some directory.
<p class="Pp">Note that the extraction with the stored paths is still necessary
    (default with unzip, specify <span class="Li">&quot;-d&quot;</span> to
    pkunzip). However, you need to know where to extract the files. You need
    also to manually change entries in <i>Config.sys</i> to reflect where did
    you put the files. Note that if you have some primitive unzipper (like
    <span class="Li">&quot;pkunzip&quot;</span>), you may get a lot of
    warnings/errors during unzipping. Upgrade to
    <span class="Li">&quot;(w)unzip&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Below is the sample of what to do to reproduce the configuration
    on my machine. In <i>VIEW.EXE</i> you can press
    <span class="Li">&quot;Ctrl-Insert&quot;</span> now, and cut-and-paste from
    the resulting file - created in the directory you started <i>VIEW.EXE</i>
    from.</p>
<p class="Pp">For each component, we mention environment variables related to
    each installation directory. Either choose directories to match your values
    of the variables, or create/append-to variables to take into account the
    directories.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="Building_a_binary_distribution"><a class="permalink" href="#Building_a_binary_distribution">Building
  a binary distribution</a></h1>
[This section provides a short overview only...]
<p class="Pp">Building should proceed differently depending on whether the
    version of perl you install is already present and used on your system, or
    is a new version not yet used. The description below assumes that the
    version is new, so installing its DLLs and <i>.pm</i> files will not disrupt
    the operation of your system even if some intermediate steps are not yet
    fully working.</p>
<p class="Pp">The other cases require a little bit more convoluted procedures.
    Below I suppose that the current version of Perl is
    <span class="Li">5.8.2</span>, so the executables are named accordingly.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>1.</dt>
  <dd>Fully build and test the Perl distribution. Make sure that no tests are
      failing with <span class="Li">&quot;test&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;aout_test&quot;</span> targets; fix the bugs in
      Perl and the Perl test suite detected by these tests. Make sure that
      <span class="Li">&quot;all_test&quot;</span> make target runs as clean as
      possible. Check that <i>os2/perlrexx.cmd</i> runs fine.</dd>
  <dt>2.</dt>
  <dd>Fully install Perl, including
      <span class="Li">&quot;installcmd&quot;</span> target. Copy the generated
      DLLs to <span class="Li">&quot;LIBPATH&quot;</span>; copy the numbered
      Perl executables (as in <i>perl5.8.2.exe</i>) to
      <span class="Li">&quot;PATH&quot;</span>; copy
      <span class="Li">&quot;perl_.exe&quot;</span> to
      <span class="Li">&quot;PATH&quot;</span> as
      <span class="Li">&quot;perl_5.8.2.exe&quot;</span>. Think whether you need
      backward-compatibility DLLs. In most cases you do not need to install them
      yet; but sometime this may simplify the following steps.</dd>
  <dt>3.</dt>
  <dd>Make sure that <span class="Li">&quot;CPAN.pm&quot;</span> can download
      files from CPAN. If not, you may need to manually install
      <span class="Li">&quot;Net::FTP&quot;</span>.</dd>
  <dt>4.</dt>
  <dd>Install the bundle <span class="Li">&quot;Bundle::OS2_default&quot;</span>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
 perl5.8.2 -MCPAN -e &quot;install Bundle::OS2_default&quot; &lt; nul |&amp; tee 00cpan_i_1
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This may take a couple of hours on 1GHz processor (when run
        the first time). And this should not be necessarily a smooth procedure.
        Some modules may not specify required dependencies, so one may need to
        repeat this procedure several times until the results stabilize.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
 perl5.8.2 -MCPAN -e &quot;install Bundle::OS2_default&quot; &lt; nul |&amp; tee 00cpan_i_2
 perl5.8.2 -MCPAN -e &quot;install Bundle::OS2_default&quot; &lt; nul |&amp; tee 00cpan_i_3
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Even after they stabilize, some tests may fail.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Fix as many discovered bugs as possible. Document all the bugs
        which are not fixed, and all the failures with unknown reasons. Inspect
        the produced logs <i>00cpan_i_1</i> to find suspiciously skipped tests,
        and other fishy events.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Keep in mind that <i>installation</i> of some modules may fail
        too: for example, the DLLs to update may be already loaded by
        <i>CPAN.pm</i>. Inspect the <span class="Li">&quot;install&quot;</span>
        logs (in the example above <i>00cpan_i_1</i> etc) for errors, and
        install things manually, as in</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
  cd $CPANHOME/.cpan/build/Digest-MD5-2.31
  make install
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Some distributions may fail some tests, but you may want to
        install them anyway (as above, or via <span class="Li">&quot;force
        install&quot;</span> command of
        <span class="Li">&quot;CPAN.pm&quot;</span> shell-mode).</p>
    <p class="Pp">Since this procedure may take quite a long time to complete,
        it makes sense to &quot;freeze&quot; your CPAN configuration by
        disabling periodic updates of the local copy of CPAN index: set
        <span class="Li">&quot;index_expire&quot;</span> to some big value (I
        use 365), then save the settings</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
  CPAN&gt; o conf index_expire 365
  CPAN&gt; o conf commit
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Reset back to the default value <span class="Li">1</span> when
        you are finished.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>5.</dt>
  <dd>When satisfied with the results, rerun the
      <span class="Li">&quot;installcmd&quot;</span> target. Now you can copy
      <span class="Li">&quot;perl5.8.2.exe&quot;</span> to
      <span class="Li">&quot;perl.exe&quot;</span>, and install the other
      OMF-build executables: <span class="Li">&quot;perl__.exe&quot;</span> etc.
      They are ready to be used.</dd>
  <dt>6.</dt>
  <dd>Change to the <span class="Li">&quot;./pod&quot;</span> directory of the
      build tree, download the Perl logo <i>CamelGrayBig.BMP</i>, and run
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
  ( perl2ipf &gt; perl.ipf ) |&amp; tee 00ipf
  ipfc /INF perl.ipf |&amp; tee 00inf
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This produces the Perl docs online book
        <span class="Li">&quot;perl.INF&quot;</span>. Install in on
        <span class="Li">&quot;BOOKSHELF&quot;</span> path.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>7.</dt>
  <dd>Now is the time to build statically linked executable <i>perl_.exe</i>
      which includes newly-installed via
      <span class="Li">&quot;Bundle::OS2_default&quot;</span> modules. Doing
      testing via <span class="Li">&quot;CPAN.pm&quot;</span> is going to be
      painfully slow, since it statically links a new executable per XS
      extension.
    <p class="Pp">Here is a possible workaround: create a toplevel
        <i>Makefile.PL</i> in <i></i><i>$CPANHOME</i><i>/.cpan/build/</i> with
        contents being (compare with &quot;Making executables with a custom
        collection of statically loaded extensions&quot;)</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
  use ExtUtils::MakeMaker;
  WriteMakefile NAME =&gt; 'dummy';
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">execute this as</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
  perl_5.8.2.exe Makefile.PL &lt;nul |&amp; tee 00aout_c1
  make -k all test &lt;nul |&amp; 00aout_t1
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Again, this procedure should not be absolutely smooth. Some
        <span class="Li">&quot;Makefile.PL&quot;</span>'s in subdirectories may
        be buggy, and would not run as &quot;child&quot; scripts. The
        interdependency of modules can strike you; however, since non-XS modules
        are already installed, the prerequisites of most modules have a very
        good chance to be present.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you discover some glitches, move directories of problematic
        modules to a different location; if these modules are non-XS modules,
        you may just ignore them - they are already installed; the remaining,
        XS, modules you need to install manually one by one.</p>
    <p class="Pp">After each such removal you need to rerun the
        <span class="Li">&quot;Makefile.PL&quot;</span>/<span class="Li">&quot;make&quot;</span>
        process; usually this procedure converges soon. (But be sure to convert
        all the necessary external C libraries from <i>.lib</i> format to
        <i>.a</i> format: run one of</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
  emxaout foo.lib
  emximp -o foo.a foo.lib
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">whichever is appropriate.) Also, make sure that the DLLs for
        external libraries are usable with with executables compiled without
        <span class="Li">&quot;-Zmtd&quot;</span> options.</p>
    <p class="Pp">When you are sure that only a few subdirectories lead to
        failures, you may want to add <span class="Li">&quot;-j4&quot;</span>
        option to <span class="Li">&quot;make&quot;</span> to speed up skipping
        subdirectories with already finished build.</p>
    <p class="Pp">When you are satisfied with the results of tests, install the
        build C libraries for extensions:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
  make install |&amp; tee 00aout_i
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Now you can rename the file <i>./perl.exe</i> generated during
        the last phase to <i>perl_5.8.2.exe</i>; place it on
        <span class="Li">&quot;PATH&quot;</span>; if there is an
        inter-dependency between some XS modules, you may need to repeat the
        <span class="Li">&quot;test&quot;</span>/<span class="Li">&quot;install&quot;</span>
        loop with this new executable and some excluded modules - until the
        procedure converges.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Now you have all the necessary <i>.a</i> libraries for these
        Perl modules in the places where Perl builder can find it. Use the perl
        builder: change to an empty directory, create a &quot;dummy&quot;
        <i>Makefile.PL</i> again, and run</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
  perl_5.8.2.exe Makefile.PL |&amp; tee 00c
  make perl                  |&amp; tee 00p
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This should create an executable <i>./perl.exe</i> with all
        the statically loaded extensions built in. Compare the generated
        <i>perlmain.c</i> files to make sure that during the iterations the
        number of loaded extensions only increases. Rename <i>./perl.exe</i> to
        <i>perl_5.8.2.exe</i> on <span class="Li">&quot;PATH&quot;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">When it converges, you got a functional variant of
        <i>perl_5.8.2.exe</i>; copy it to
        <span class="Li">&quot;perl_.exe&quot;</span>. You are done with
        generation of the local Perl installation.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>8.</dt>
  <dd>Make sure that the installed modules are actually installed in the
      location of the new Perl, and are not inherited from entries of
      <span class="Li">@INC</span> given for inheritance from the older versions
      of Perl: set <span class="Li">&quot;PERLLIB_582_PREFIX&quot;</span> to
      redirect the new version of Perl to a new location, and copy the installed
      files to this new location. Redo the tests to make sure that the versions
      of modules inherited from older versions of Perl are not needed.
    <p class="Pp">Actually, the log output of <b>pod2ipf</b>(1) during the step
        6 gives a very detailed info about which modules are loaded from which
        place; so you may use it as an additional verification tool.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Check that some temporary files did not make into the perl
        install tree. Run something like this</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
  pfind . -f &quot;!(/\.(pm|pl|ix|al|h|a|lib|txt|pod|imp|bs|dll|ld|bs|inc|xbm|yml|cgi|uu|e2x|skip|packlist|eg|cfg|html|pub|enc|all|ini|po|pot)$/i or /^\w+$/&quot;) | less
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">in the install tree (both top one and <i>sitelib</i> one).</p>
    <p class="Pp">Compress all the DLLs with <i>lxlite</i>. The tiny <i>.exe</i>
        can be compressed with <span class="Li">&quot;/c:max&quot;</span> (the
        bug only appears when there is a fixup in the last 6 bytes of a page
        (?); since the tiny executables are much smaller than a page, the bug
        will not hit). Do not compress
        <span class="Li">&quot;perl_.exe&quot;</span> - it would not work under
        DOS.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>9.</dt>
  <dd>Now you can generate the binary distribution. This is done by running the
      test of the CPAN distribution
      <span class="Li">&quot;OS2::SoftInstaller&quot;</span>. Tune up the file
      <i>test.pl</i> to suit the layout of current version of Perl first. Do not
      forget to pack the necessary external DLLs accordingly. Include the
      description of the bugs and test suite failures you could not fix. Include
      the small-stack versions of Perl executables from Perl build directory.
    <p class="Pp">Include <i>perl5.def</i> so that people can relink the perl
        DLL preserving the binary compatibility, or can create compatibility
        DLLs. Include the diff files (<span class="Li">&quot;diff -pu old
        new&quot;</span>) of fixes you did so that people can rebuild your
        version. Include <i>perl5.map</i> so that one can use remote
      debugging.</p>

  executables with a custom search-paths</a></h2>
The default perl executable is flexible enough to support most usages. However,
  one may want something yet more flexible; for example, one may want to find
  Perl DLL relatively to the location of the EXE file; or one may want to ignore
  the environment when setting the Perl-library search patch, etc.
<p class="Pp">If you fill comfortable with <i>embedding</i> interface (see
    perlembed), such things are easy to do repeating the steps outlined in
    L/&lt;Making executables with a custom collection of statically loaded
    extensions&gt;, and doing more comprehensive edits to <b>main()</b> of
    <i>perlmain.c</i>. The people with little desire to understand Perl can just
    rename <b>main()</b>, and do necessary modification in a custom
    <b>main()</b> which calls the renamed function in appropriate time.</p>
<p class="Pp">However, there is a third way: perl DLL exports the <b>main()</b>
    function and several callbacks to customize the search path. Below is a
    complete example of a &quot;Perl loader&quot; which</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>1.</dt>
  <dd>Looks for Perl DLL in the directory
      <span class="Li">&quot;$exedir/../dll&quot;</span>;</dd>
  <dt>2.</dt>
  <dd>Prepends the above directory to
      <span class="Li">&quot;BEGINLIBPATH&quot;</span>;</dd>
  <dt>3.</dt>
  <dd>Fails if the Perl DLL found via
      <span class="Li">&quot;BEGINLIBPATH&quot;</span> is different from what
      was loaded on step 1; e.g., another process could have loaded it from
      <span class="Li">&quot;LIBPATH&quot;</span> or from a different value of
      <span class="Li">&quot;BEGINLIBPATH&quot;</span>. In these cases one needs
      to modify the setting of the system so that this other process either does
      not run, or loads the DLL from
      <span class="Li">&quot;BEGINLIBPATH&quot;</span> with
      <span class="Li">&quot;LIBPATHSTRICT=T&quot;</span> (available with
      kernels after September 2000).</dd>
  <dt>4.</dt>
  <dd>Loads Perl library from

<p class="Pp"><b>WARNING</b>. Calling

    could lock the system before Warp3 fixpak22. Starting with Warp3, Perl will
    use a workaround: it aborts <b>getpriority()</b> if the process is not

<h2 class="Ss" id="_system()_"><a class="permalink" href="#_system()_">&quot;system()&quot;</a></h2>
Multi-argument form of <span class="Li">&quot;system()&quot;</span> allows an
  additional numeric argument. The meaning of this argument is described in
  OS2::Process.
<p class="Pp">When finding a program to run, Perl first asks the OS to look for
    executables on <span class="Li">&quot;PATH&quot;</span> (OS/2 adds extension
    <i>.exe</i> if no extension is present). If not found, it looks for a script
    with possible extensions added in this order: no extension, <i>.cmd</i>,
    <i>.btm</i>, <i>.bat</i>, <i>.pl</i>. If found, Perl checks the start of the
    file for magic strings <span class="Li">&quot;#!&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;extproc &quot;</span>. If found, Perl uses the rest
    of the first line as the beginning of the command line to run this script.
    The only mangling done to the first line is extraction of arguments
    (currently up to 3), and ignoring of the path-part of the
    &quot;interpreter&quot; name if it can't be found using the full path.</p>
<p class="Pp">E.g., <span class="Li">&quot;system 'foo', 'bar',
    'baz'&quot;</span> may lead Perl to finding <i>C:/emx/bin/foo.cmd</i> with
    the first line being</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
 extproc /bin/bash    -x   -c
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If <i>/bin/bash.exe</i> is not found, then Perl looks for an
    executable <i>bash.exe</i> on <span class="Li">&quot;PATH&quot;</span>. If
    found in <i>C:/emx.add/bin/bash.exe</i>, then the above <b>system()</b> is
    translated to</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  system qw(C:/emx.add/bin/bash.exe -x -c C:/emx/bin/foo.cmd bar baz)
</pre>
<p class="Pp">One additional translation is performed: instead of <i>/bin/sh</i>
    Perl uses the hardwired-or-customized shell (see
    &quot;<span class="Li">&quot;PERL_SH_DIR&quot;</span>&quot;).</p>
<p class="Pp">The above search for &quot;interpreter&quot; is recursive: if
    <i>bash</i> executable is not found, but <i>bash.btm</i> is found, Perl will
    investigate its first line etc. The only hardwired limit on the recursion
    depth is implicit: there is a limit 4 on the number of additional arguments
    inserted before the actual arguments given to <b>system()</b>. In
    particular, if no additional arguments are specified on the
    &quot;magic&quot; first lines, then the limit on the depth is 4.</p>
<p class="Pp">If Perl finds that the found executable is of PM type when the
    current session is not, it will start the new process in a separate session
    of necessary type. Call via <span class="Li">&quot;OS2::Process&quot;</span>
    to disable this magic.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>WARNING</b>. Due to the described logic, you need to explicitly
    specify <i>.com</i> extension if needed. Moreover, if the executable
    <i>perl5.6.1</i> is requested, Perl will not look for <i>perl5.6.1.exe</i>.

  <li>Apparently, IBM used a compiler (for some period of time around '95?)
      which changes FP mask right and left. This is not <i>that</i> bad for
      IBM's programs, but the same compiler was used for DLLs which are used
      with general-purpose applications. When these DLLs are used, the state of
      floating-point flags in the application is not predictable.
    <p class="Pp">What is much worse, some DLLs change the floating point flags
        when in <b>_DLLInitTerm()</b> (e.g., <i>TCP32IP</i>). This means that
        even if you do not <i>call</i> any function in the DLL, just the act of
        loading this DLL will reset your flags. What is worse, the same compiler
        was used to compile some HOOK DLLs. Given that HOOK dlls are executed in
        the context of <i>all</i> the applications in the system, this means a
        complete unpredictability of floating point flags on systems using such
        HOOK DLLs. E.g., <i>GAMESRVR.DLL</i> of <b>DIVE</b> origin changes the
        floating point flags on each write to the TTY of a VIO (windowed
        text-mode) applications.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Some other (not completely debugged) situations when FP flags
        change include some video drivers (?), and some operations related to
        creation of the windows. People who code <b>OpenGL</b> may have more
        experience on this.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Perl is generally used in the situation when all the
        floating-point exceptions are ignored, as is the default under EMX. If
        they are not ignored, some benign Perl programs would get a
        <span class="Li">&quot;SIGFPE&quot;</span> and would die a horrible
        death.</p>
    <p class="Pp">To circumvent this, Perl uses two hacks. They help against
        <i>one</i> type of damage only: FP flags changed when loading a DLL.</p>
    <p class="Pp">One of the hacks is to disable floating point exceptions on
        Perl startup (as is the default with EMX). This helps only with
        compile-time-linked DLLs changing the flags before <b>main()</b> had a
        chance to be called.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The other hack is to restore FP flags after a call to
        <b>dlopen()</b>. This helps against similar damage done by DLLs
        <b>_DLLInitTerm()</b> at runtime. Currently no way to switch these hacks
        off is provided.</p>

Since to call certain OS/2 API one needs to have a correctly initialized

  may require getting <span class="Li">&quot;HAB&quot;</span>s and
  <span class="Li">&quot;HMQ&quot;</span>s. If an extension would do it on its

<p class="Pp">Perl provides a centralized management of these resources:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>&quot;HAB&quot;</dt>
  <dd>To get the HAB, the extension should call <span class="Li">&quot;hab =

  <li>the extension needs an <span class="Li">&quot;HMQ&quot;</span> since it

  <dt>Treating errors reported by OS/2 API</dt>
  <dd>There are two principal conventions (it is useful to call them
      <span class="Li">&quot;Dos*&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;Win*&quot;</span> - though this part of the
      function signature is not always determined by the name of the API) of
      reporting the error conditions of OS/2 API. Most of
      <span class="Li">&quot;Dos*&quot;</span> APIs report the error code as the
      result of the call (so 0 means success, and there are many types of
      errors). Most of <span class="Li">&quot;Win*&quot;</span> API report
      success/fail via the result being
      <span class="Li">&quot;TRUE&quot;</span>/<span class="Li">&quot;FALSE&quot;</span>;
      to find the reason for the failure one should call
      <b>WinGetLastError()</b> API.
    <p class="Pp">Some <span class="Li">&quot;Win*&quot;</span> entry points
        also overload a &quot;meaningful&quot; return value with the error
        indicator; having a 0 return value indicates an error. Yet some other
        <span class="Li">&quot;Win*&quot;</span> entry points overload things
        even more, and 0 return value may mean a successful call returning a
        valid value 0, as well as an error condition; in the case of a 0 return
        value one should call <b>WinGetLastError()</b> API to distinguish a
        successful call from a failing one.</p>
    <p class="Pp">By convention, all the calls to OS/2 API should indicate their
        failures by resetting $^E. All the Perl-accessible functions which call
        OS/2 API may be broken into two classes: some <b>die()</b>s when an API
        error is encountered, the other report the error via a false return
        value (of course, this does not concern Perl-accessible functions which
        <i>expect</i> a failure of the OS/2 API call, having some workarounds
        coded).</p>
    <p class="Pp">Obviously, in the situation of the last type of the signature
        of an OS/2 API, it is must more convenient for the users if the failure
        is indicated by <b>die()</b>ing: one does not need to check $^E to know
        that something went wrong. If, however, this solution is not desirable
        by some reason, the code in question should reset $^E to 0 before making
        this OS/2 API call, so that the caller of this Perl-accessible function
        has a chance to distinguish a success-but-0-return value from a failure.

Because of idiosyncrasies of OS/2 one cannot have all the eggs in the same
  basket (though EMX environment tries hard to overcome this limitations, so the
  situation may somehow improve). There are 4 executables for Perl provided by
  the distribution:
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="_fIperl.exe_fP"><a class="permalink" href="#_fIperl.exe_fP"><i>perl.exe</i></a></h2>
The main workhorse. This is a chimera executable: it is compiled as an
  <span class="Li">&quot;a.out&quot;</span>-style executable, but is linked with
  <span class="Li">&quot;omf&quot;</span>-style dynamic library <i>perl.dll</i>,
  and with dynamic CRT DLL. This executable is a VIO application.
<p class="Pp">It can load perl dynamic extensions, and it can <b>fork()</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Note.</b> Keep in mind that <b>fork()</b> is needed to open a
    pipe to yourself.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="_fIperl_.exe_fP"><a class="permalink" href="#_fIperl_.exe_fP"><i>perl_.exe</i></a></h2>
This is a statically linked <span class="Li">&quot;a.out&quot;</span>-style
  executable. It cannot load dynamic Perl extensions. The executable supplied in
  binary distributions has a lot of extensions prebuilt, thus the above
  restriction is important only if you use custom-built extensions. This
  executable is a VIO application.
<p class="Pp"><i>This is the only executable with does not require OS/2.</i> The
    friends locked into <span class="Li">&quot;M$&quot;</span> world would
    appreciate the fact that this executable runs under DOS, Win0.3*, Win0.95
    and WinNT with an appropriate extender. See &quot;Other OSes&quot;.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="_fIperl____.exe_fP"><a class="permalink" href="#_fIperl____.exe_fP"><i>perl__.exe</i></a></h2>
This is the same executable as <i>perl___.exe</i>, but it is a PM application.
<p class="Pp"><b>Note.</b> Usually (unless explicitly redirected during the
    startup) STDIN, STDERR, and STDOUT of a PM application are redirected to
    <i>nul</i>. However, it is possible to <i>see</i> them if you start
    <span class="Li">&quot;perl__.exe&quot;</span> from a PM program which
    emulates a console window, like <i>Shell mode</i> of Emacs or EPM. Thus it
    <i>is</i> <i>possible</i> to use Perl debugger (see perldebug) to debug your
    PM application (but beware of the message loop lockups - this will not work
    if you have a message queue to serve, unless you hook the serving into the
    <b>getc()</b> function of the debugger).</p>
<p class="Pp">Another way to see the output of a PM program is to run it as</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  pm_prog args 2&gt;&amp;1 | cat -
</pre>
<p class="Pp">with a shell <i>different</i> from <i>cmd.exe</i>, so that it does
    not create a link between a VIO session and the session of
    <span class="Li">&quot;pm_porg&quot;</span>. (Such a link closes the VIO
    window.) E.g., this works with <i>sh.exe</i> - or with Perl!</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  open P, 'pm_prog args 2&gt;&amp;1 |' or die;
  print while &lt;P&gt;;
</pre>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Why_dynamic_linking?"><a class="permalink" href="#Why_dynamic_linking?">Why
  dynamic linking?</a></h2>
Well, having several executables dynamically linked to the same huge library has
  its advantages, but this would not substantiate the additional work to make it
  compile. The reason is the complicated-to-developers but very quick and
  convenient-to-users &quot;hard&quot; dynamic linking used by OS/2.
<p class="Pp">There are two distinctive features of the dyna-linking model of
    OS/2: first, all the references to external functions are resolved at the
    compile time; second, there is no runtime fixup of the DLLs after they are
    loaded into memory. The first feature is an enormous advantage over other
    models: it avoids conflicts when several DLLs used by an application export
    entries with the same name. In such cases &quot;other&quot; models of
    dyna-linking just choose between these two entry points using some random
    criterion - with predictable disasters as results. But it is the second
    feature which requires the build of <i>perl.dll</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The address tables of DLLs are patched only once, when they are
    loaded. The addresses of the entry points into DLLs are guaranteed to be the
    same for all the programs which use the same DLL. This removes the runtime
    fixup - once DLL is loaded, its code is read-only.</p>
<p class="Pp">While this allows some (significant?) performance advantages, this
    makes life much harder for developers, since the above scheme makes it
    impossible for a DLL to be &quot;linked&quot; to a symbol in the <i>.EXE</i>
    file. Indeed, this would need a DLL to have different relocations tables for
    the (different) executables which use this DLL.</p>
<p class="Pp">However, a dynamically loaded Perl extension is forced to use some
    symbols from the perl executable, e.g., to know how to find the arguments to
    the functions: the arguments live on the perl internal evaluation stack. The
    solution is to put the main code of the interpreter into a DLL, and make the
    <i>.EXE</i> file which just loads this DLL into memory and supplies
    command-arguments. The extension DLL cannot link to symbols in <i>.EXE</i>,
    but it has no problem linking to symbols in the <i>.DLL</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">This <i>greatly</i> increases the load time for the application
    (as well as complexity of the compilation). Since interpreter is in a DLL,
    the C RTL is basically forced to reside in a DLL as well (otherwise
    extensions would not be able to use CRT). There are some advantages if you
    use different flavors of perl, such as running <i>perl.exe</i> and
    <i>perl__.exe</i> simultaneously: they share the memory of
  <i>perl.dll</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>NOTE</b>. There is one additional effect which makes DLLs more
    wasteful: DLLs are loaded in the shared memory region, which is a scarse
    resource given the 512M barrier of the &quot;standard&quot; OS/2 virtual
    memory. The code of <i>.EXE</i> files is also shared by all the processes
    which use the particular <i>.EXE</i>, but they are &quot;shared in the
    private address space of the process&quot;; this is possible because the
    address at which different sections of the <i>.EXE</i> file are loaded is
    decided at compile-time, thus all the processes have these sections loaded
    at same addresses, and no fixup of internal links inside the <i>.EXE</i> is
    needed.</p>
<p class="Pp">Since DLLs may be loaded at run time, to have the same mechanism
    for DLLs one needs to have the address range of <i>any of the loaded</i>
    DLLs in the system to be available <i>in all the processes</i> which did not
    load a particular DLL yet. This is why the DLLs are mapped to the shared
    memory region.</p>

With the release 5.003_01 the dynamically loadable libraries should be rebuilt
  when a different version of Perl is compiled. In particular, DLLs (including
  <i>perl.dll</i>) are now created with the names which contain a checksum, thus
  allowing workaround for OS/2 scheme of caching DLLs.
<p class="Pp">It may be possible to code a simple workaround which would</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>find the old DLLs looking through the old
    <span class="Li">@INC</span>;</li>
  <li>mangle the names according to the scheme of new perl and copy the DLLs to
      these names;</li>
  <li>edit the internal <span class="Li">&quot;LX&quot;</span> tables of DLL to
      reflect the change of the name (probably not needed for Perl extension
      DLLs, since the internally coded names are not used for
      &quot;specific&quot; DLLs, they used only for &quot;global&quot;
    DLLs).</li>
  <li>edit the internal <span class="Li">&quot;IMPORT&quot;</span> tables and
      change the name of the &quot;old&quot; <i>perl????.dll</i> to the
      &quot;new&quot; <i>perl????.dll</i>.</li>

  name mangling: 5.6.2 and beyond</a></h2>
In fact mangling of <i>extension</i> DLLs was done due to misunderstanding of
  the OS/2 dynaloading model. OS/2 (effectively) maintains two different tables
  of loaded DLL:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>Global DLLs</dt>
  <dd>those loaded by the base name from
      <span class="Li">&quot;LIBPATH&quot;</span>; including those associated at
      link time;</dd>
  <dt>specific DLLs</dt>
  <dd>loaded by the full name.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">When resolving a request for a global DLL, the table of
    already-loaded specific DLLs is (effectively) ignored; moreover, specific
    DLLs are <i>always</i> loaded from the prescribed path.</p>
<p class="Pp">There is/was a minor twist which makes this scheme fragile: what
    to do with DLLs loaded from</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>&quot;BEGINLIBPATH&quot; and &quot;ENDLIBPATH&quot;</dt>
  <dd>(which depend on the process)</dd>
  <dt><i>.</i> from &quot;LIBPATH&quot;</dt>
  <dd>which <i>effectively</i> depends on the process (although
      <span class="Li">&quot;LIBPATH&quot;</span> is the same for all the
      processes).</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Unless <span class="Li">&quot;LIBPATHSTRICT&quot;</span> is set to
    <span class="Li">&quot;T&quot;</span> (and the kernel is after 2000/09/01),
    such DLLs are considered to be global. When loading a global DLL it is first
    looked in the table of already-loaded global DLLs. Because of this the fact
    that one executable loaded a DLL from
    <span class="Li">&quot;BEGINLIBPATH&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;ENDLIBPATH&quot;</span>, or <i>.</i> from
    <span class="Li">&quot;LIBPATH&quot;</span> may affect <i>which</i> DLL is
    loaded when <i>another</i> executable requests a DLL with the same name.
    <i>This</i> is the reason for version-specific mangling of the DLL name for
    perl DLL.</p>
<p class="Pp">Since the Perl extension DLLs are always loaded with the full
    path, there is no need to mangle their names in a version-specific ways:
    their directory already reflects the corresponding version of perl, and
    <span class="Li">@INC</span> takes into account binary compatibility with
    older version. Starting from <span class="Li">5.6.2</span> the name mangling
    scheme is fixed to be the same as for Perl 5.005_53 (same as in a popular
    binary release). Thus new Perls will be able to <i>resolve the names</i> of
    old extension DLLs if <span class="Li">@INC</span> allows finding their
    directories.</p>
<p class="Pp">However, this still does not guarantee that these DLL may be
    loaded. The reason is the mangling of the name of the <i>Perl DLL</i>. And
    since the extension DLLs link with the Perl DLL, extension DLLs for older
    versions would load an older Perl DLL, and would most probably segfault
    (since the data in this DLL is not properly initialized).</p>
<p class="Pp">There is a partial workaround (which can be made complete with
    newer OS/2 kernels): create a forwarder DLL with the same name as the DLL of
    the older version of Perl, which forwards the entry points to the newer
    Perl's DLL. Make this DLL accessible on (say) the
    <span class="Li">&quot;BEGINLIBPATH&quot;</span> of the new Perl executable.
    When the new executable accesses old Perl's extension DLLs, they would
    request the old Perl's DLL by name, get the forwarder instead, so
    effectively will link with the currently running (new) Perl DLL.</p>
<p class="Pp">This may break in two ways:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Old perl executable is started when a new executable is running has loaded
      an extension compiled for the old executable (ouph!). In this case the old
      executable will get a forwarder DLL instead of the old perl DLL, so would
      link with the new perl DLL. While not directly fatal, it will behave the
      same as new executable. This beats the whole purpose of explicitly
      starting an old executable.</li>
  <li>A new executable loads an extension compiled for the old executable when
      an old perl executable is running. In this case the extension will not
      pick up the forwarder - with fatal results.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">With support for <span class="Li">&quot;LIBPATHSTRICT&quot;</span>
    this may be circumvented - unless one of DLLs is started from <i>.</i> from
    <span class="Li">&quot;LIBPATH&quot;</span> (I do not know whether
    <span class="Li">&quot;LIBPATHSTRICT&quot;</span> affects this case).</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>REMARK</b>. Unless newer kernels allow <i>.</i> in
    <span class="Li">&quot;BEGINLIBPATH&quot;</span> (older do not), this mess
    cannot be completely cleaned. (It turns out that as of the beginning of
    2002, <i>.</i> is not allowed, but <i>.\.</i> is - and it has the same
    effect.)</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>REMARK</b>. <span class="Li">&quot;LIBPATHSTRICT&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;BEGINLIBPATH&quot;</span> and

<h2 class="Ss" id="Calls_to_external_programs"><a class="permalink" href="#Calls_to_external_programs">Calls
  to external programs</a></h2>
Due to a popular demand the perl external program calling has been changed wrt
  Andreas Kaiser's port. <i>If</i> perl needs to call an external program <i>via
  shell</i>, the <i>f:/bin/sh.exe</i> will be called, or whatever is the
  override, see &quot;<span class="Li">&quot;PERL_SH_DIR&quot;</span>&quot;.
<p class="Pp">Thus means that you need to get some copy of a <i>sh.exe</i> as
    well (I use one from pdksh). The path <i>F:/bin</i> above is set up
    automatically during the build to a correct value on the builder machine,
    but is overridable at runtime,</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Reasons:</b> a consensus on
    <span class="Li">&quot;perl5-porters&quot;</span> was that perl should use
    one non-overridable shell per platform. The obvious choices for OS/2 are
    <i>cmd.exe</i> and <i>sh.exe</i>. Having perl build itself would be
    impossible with <i>cmd.exe</i> as a shell, thus I picked up
    <span class="Li">&quot;sh.exe&quot;</span>. This assures almost 100%
    compatibility with the scripts coming from *nix. As an added benefit this
    works as well under DOS if you use DOS-enabled port of pdksh (see
    &quot;Prerequisites&quot;).</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Disadvantages:</b> currently <i>sh.exe</i> of pdksh calls
    external programs via <b>fork()</b>/<b>exec()</b>, and there is <i>no</i>
    functioning <b>exec()</b> on OS/2. <b>exec()</b> is emulated by EMX by an
    asynchronous call while the caller waits for child completion (to pretend
    that the <span class="Li">&quot;pid&quot;</span> did not change). This means
    that 1 <i>extra</i> copy of <i>sh.exe</i> is made active via
    <b>fork()</b>/<b>exec()</b>, which may lead to some resources taken from the
    system (even if we do not count extra work needed for <b>fork()</b>ing).</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that this a lesser issue now when we do not spawn
    <i>sh.exe</i> unless needed (metachars found).</p>
<p class="Pp">One can always start <i>cmd.exe</i> explicitly via</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  system 'cmd', '/c', 'mycmd', 'arg1', 'arg2', ...
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If you need to use <i>cmd.exe</i>, and do not want to hand-edit

<p class="Pp">which will override <b>system()</b>, <b>exec()</b>,

    override only <b>system()</b>, <b>readpipe()</b> - the explicit version of

  allocation</a></h2>
Perl uses its own <b>malloc()</b> under OS/2 - interpreters are usually
  malloc-bound for speed, but perl is not, since its malloc is lightning-fast.
  Perl-memory-usage-tuned benchmarks show that Perl's malloc is 5 times quicker
  than EMX one. I do not have convincing data about memory footprint, but a
  (pretty random) benchmark showed that Perl's one is 5% better.
<p class="Pp">Combination of perl's <b>malloc()</b> and rigid DLL name
    resolution creates a special problem with library functions which expect
    their return value to be <b>free()</b>d by system's <b>free()</b>. To
    facilitate extensions which need to call such functions, system
    memory-allocation functions are still available with the prefix
    <span class="Li">&quot;emx_&quot;</span> added. (Currently only DLL perl has
    this, it should propagate to <i>perl_.exe</i> shortly.)</p>

One can build perl with thread support enabled by providing
  <span class="Li">&quot;-D usethreads&quot;</span> option to <i>Configure</i>.
  Currently OS/2 support of threads is very preliminary.
<p class="Pp">Most notable problems:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>&quot;COND_WAIT&quot;</dt>
  <dd>may have a race condition (but probably does not due to edge-triggered
      nature of OS/2 Event semaphores). (Needs a reimplementation (in terms of
      chaining waiting threads, with the linked list stored in per-thread
      structure?)?)</dd>
  <dt><i>os2.c</i></dt>
  <dd>has a couple of static variables used in OS/2-specific functions. (Need to
      be moved to per-thread structure, or serialized?)</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Note that these problems should not discourage experimenting,
    since they have a low probability of affecting small programs.</p>
