   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

This command implements simple pointer and keyboard grabs for Tk. Tk's grabs are
  different than the grabs described in the Xlib documentation. When a grab is
  set for a particular window, Tk restricts all pointer events to the grab
  window and its descendants in Tk's window hierarchy. Whenever the pointer is
  within the grab window's subtree, the pointer will behave exactly the same as
  if there had been no grab at all and all events will be reported in the normal
  fashion. When the pointer is outside <i>window</i>'s tree, button presses and
  releases and mouse motion events are reported to <i>window</i>, and window
  entry and window exit events are ignored. The grab subtree
  &#x201C;owns&#x201D; the pointer: windows outside the grab subtree will be
  visible on the screen but they will be insensitive until the grab is released.
  The tree of windows underneath the grab window can include top-level windows,
  in which case all of those top-level windows and their descendants will
  continue to receive mouse events during the grab.
<p class="Pp">Two forms of grabs are possible: local and global. A local grab
    affects only the grabbing application: events will be reported to other
    applications as if the grab had never occurred. Grabs are local by default.
    A global grab locks out all applications on the screen, so that only the
    given subtree of the grabbing application will be sensitive to pointer
    events (mouse button presses, mouse button releases, pointer motions, window
    entries, and window exits). During global grabs the window manager will not
    receive pointer events either.</p>
<p class="Pp">During local grabs, keyboard events (key presses and key releases)
    are delivered as usual: the window manager controls which application
    receives keyboard events, and if they are sent to any window in the grabbing
    application then they are redirected to the focus window. During a global
    grab Tk grabs the keyboard so that all keyboard events are always sent to
    the grabbing application. The <b>focus</b> command is still used to
    determine which window in the application receives the keyboard events. The
    keyboard grab is released when the grab is released.</p>
<p class="Pp">Grabs apply to particular displays. If an application has windows
    on multiple displays then it can establish a separate grab on each display.
    The grab on a particular display affects only the windows on that display.
    It is possible for different applications on a single display to have
    simultaneous local grabs, but only one application can have a global grab on
    a given display at once.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>grab</b> command can take any of the following forms:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>grab </b>?<b>-global</b>? <i>window</i></dt>
  <dd>Same as <b>grab set</b>, described below.</dd>
  <dt><b>grab current </b>?<i>window</i>?</dt>
  <dd>If <i>window</i> is specified, returns the name of the current grab window
      in this application for <i>window</i>'s display, or an empty string if
      there is no such window. If <i>window</i> is omitted, the command returns
      a list whose elements are all of the windows grabbed by this application
      for all displays, or an empty string if the application has no grabs.</dd>
  <dt><b>grab release </b><i>window</i></dt>
  <dd>Releases the grab on <i>window</i> if there is one, otherwise does
      nothing. Returns an empty string.</dd>
  <dt><b>grab set </b>?<b>-global</b>? <i>window</i></dt>
  <dd>Sets a grab on <i>window</i>. If <b>-global</b> is specified then the grab
      is global, otherwise it is local. If a grab was already in effect for this
      application on <i>window</i>'s display then it is automatically released.
      If there is already a grab on <i>window</i> and it has the same
      global/local form as the requested grab, then the command does nothing.
      Returns an empty string.</dd>
  <dt><b>grab status </b><i>window</i></dt>
  <dd>Returns <b>none</b> if no grab is currently set on <i>window</i>,
      <b>local</b> if a local grab is set on <i>window</i>, and <b>global</b> if
      a global grab is set.</dd>
</dl>

<h1 class="Sh" id="WARNING"><a class="permalink" href="#WARNING">WARNING</a></h1>
It is very easy to use global grabs to render a display completely unusable
  (e.g. by setting a grab on a widget which does not respond to events and not
  providing any mechanism for releasing the grab). Take <i>extreme</i> care when
  using them!

<h1 class="Sh" id="BUGS"><a class="permalink" href="#BUGS">BUGS</a></h1>
It took an incredibly complex and gross implementation to produce the simple
  grab effect described above. Given the current implementation, it is not safe
  for applications to use the Xlib grab facilities at all except through the Tk
  grab procedures. If applications try to manipulate X's grab mechanisms
  directly, things will probably break.
<p class="Pp">If a single process is managing several different Tk applications,
    only one of those applications can have a local grab for a given display at
    any given time. If the applications are in different processes, this
    restriction does not exist.</p>

Set a grab so that only one button may be clicked out of a group. The other
  buttons are unresponsive to the mouse until the middle button is clicked.
