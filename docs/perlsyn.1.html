<p class="Pp">A Perl program consists of a sequence of declarations and
    statements which run from the top to the bottom. Loops, subroutines, and
    other control structures allow you to jump around within the code.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl is a <b>free-form</b> language: you can format and indent it
    however you like. Whitespace serves mostly to separate tokens, unlike
    languages like Python where it is an important part of the syntax, or
    Fortran where it is immaterial.</p>
<p class="Pp">Many of Perl's syntactic elements are <b>optional</b>. Rather than
    requiring you to put parentheses around every function call and declare
    every variable, you can often leave such explicit elements off and Perl will
    figure out what you meant. This is known as <b>Do What I</b> <b>Mean</b>,
    abbreviated <b>DWIM</b>. It allows programmers to be <b>lazy</b> and to code
    in a style with which they are comfortable.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl <b>borrows syntax</b> and concepts from many languages: awk,
    sed, C, Bourne Shell, Smalltalk, Lisp and even English. Other languages have
    borrowed syntax from Perl, particularly its regular expression extensions.
    So if you have programmed in another language you will see familiar pieces
    in Perl. They often work the same, but see perltrap for information about
    how they differ.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Declarations"><a class="permalink" href="#Declarations">Declarations</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The only things you need to declare in Perl are report formats and
    subroutines (and sometimes not even subroutines). A scalar variable holds
    the undefined value (<span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span>) until it has
    been assigned a defined value, which is anything other than
    <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span>. When used as a number,
    <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> is treated as
    <span class="Li">0</span>; when used as a string, it is treated as the empty
    string, <span class="Li">&quot;&quot;</span>; and when used as a reference
    that isn't being assigned to, it is treated as an error. If you enable
    warnings, you'll be notified of an uninitialized value whenever you treat
    <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> as a string or a number. Well,
    usually. Boolean contexts, such as:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    if ($a) {}
</pre>
<p class="Pp">are exempt from warnings (because they care about truth rather
    than definedness). Operators such as <span class="Li">&quot;++&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;--&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;+=&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;-=&quot;</span>, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;.=&quot;</span>, that operate on undefined variables
    such as:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    undef $a;
    $a++;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">are also always exempt from such warnings.</p>
<p class="Pp">A declaration can be put anywhere a statement can, but has no
    effect on the execution of the primary sequence of statements: declarations
    all take effect at compile time. All declarations are typically put at the
    beginning or the end of the script. However, if you're using
    lexically-scoped private variables created with
    <span class="Li">&quot;my()&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;state()&quot;</span>, or
    <span class="Li">&quot;our()&quot;</span>, you'll have to make sure your
    format or subroutine definition is within the same block scope as the my if
    you expect to be able to access those private variables.</p>
<p class="Pp">Declaring a subroutine allows a subroutine name to be used as if
    it were a list operator from that point forward in the program. You can
    declare a subroutine without defining it by saying
    <span class="Li">&quot;sub name&quot;</span>, thus:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    sub myname;
    $me = myname $0             or die &quot;can't get myname&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">A bare declaration like that declares the function to be a list
    operator, not a unary operator, so you have to be careful to use parentheses
    (or <span class="Li">&quot;or&quot;</span> instead of
    <span class="Li">&quot;||&quot;</span>.) The
    <span class="Li">&quot;||&quot;</span> operator binds too tightly to use
    after list operators; it becomes part of the last element. You can always
    use parentheses around the list operators arguments to turn the list
    operator back into something that behaves more like a function call.
    Alternatively, you can use the prototype
    <span class="Li">&quot;($)&quot;</span> to turn the subroutine into a unary
    operator:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  sub myname ($);
  $me = myname $0             || die &quot;can't get myname&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">That now parses as you'd expect, but you still ought to get in the
    habit of using parentheses in that situation. For more on prototypes, see
    perlsub.</p>
<p class="Pp">Subroutines declarations can also be loaded up with the
    <span class="Li">&quot;require&quot;</span> statement or both loaded and
    imported into your namespace with a <span class="Li">&quot;use&quot;</span>
    statement. See perlmod for details on this.</p>
<p class="Pp">A statement sequence may contain declarations of lexically-scoped
    variables, but apart from declaring a variable name, the declaration acts
    like an ordinary statement, and is elaborated within the sequence of
    statements as if it were an ordinary statement. That means it actually has
    both compile-time and run-time effects.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Comments"><a class="permalink" href="#Comments">Comments</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Text from a <span class="Li">&quot;#&quot;</span> character until
    the end of the line is a comment, and is ignored. Exceptions include
    <span class="Li">&quot;#&quot;</span> inside a string or regular
  expression.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Simple_Statements"><a class="permalink" href="#Simple_Statements">Simple
  Statements</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The only kind of simple statement is an expression evaluated for
    its side-effects. Every simple statement must be terminated with a
    semicolon, unless it is the final statement in a block, in which case the
    semicolon is optional. But put the semicolon in anyway if the block takes up
    more than one line, because you may eventually add another line. Note that
    there are operators like <span class="Li">&quot;eval {}&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;sub {}&quot;</span>, and <span class="Li">&quot;do
    {}&quot;</span> that <i>look</i> like compound statements, but
    aren't--they're just TERMs in an expression--and thus need an explicit
    termination when used as the last item in a statement.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Statement_Modifiers"><a class="permalink" href="#Statement_Modifiers">Statement
  Modifiers</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Any simple statement may optionally be followed by a <i>SINGLE</i>
    modifier, just before the terminating semicolon (or block ending). The
    possible modifiers are:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    if EXPR
    unless EXPR
    while EXPR
    until EXPR
    for LIST
    foreach LIST
    when EXPR
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;EXPR&quot;</span> following the
    modifier is referred to as the &quot;condition&quot;. Its truth or falsehood
    determines how the modifier will behave.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;if&quot;</span> executes the statement once
    <i>if</i> and only if the condition is true.
    <span class="Li">&quot;unless&quot;</span> is the opposite, it executes the
    statement <i>unless</i> the condition is true (that is, if the condition is
    false). See &quot;Scalar values&quot; in perldata for definitions of true
    and false.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    print &quot;Basset hounds got long ears&quot; if length $ear &gt;= 10;
    go_outside() and play() unless $is_raining;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;for(each)&quot;</span> modifier is an
    iterator: it executes the statement once for each item in the LIST (with
    <span class="Li">$_</span> aliased to each item in turn). There is no syntax
    to specify a C-style for loop or a lexically scoped iteration variable in
    this form.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    print &quot;Hello $_!\n&quot; for qw(world Dolly nurse);
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;while&quot;</span> repeats the statement
    <i>while</i> the condition is true. Postfix
    <span class="Li">&quot;while&quot;</span> has the same magic treatment of
    some kinds of condition that prefix
    <span class="Li">&quot;while&quot;</span> has.
    <span class="Li">&quot;until&quot;</span> does the opposite, it repeats the
    statement <i>until</i> the condition is true (or while the condition is
    false):</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    # Both of these count from 0 to 10.
    print $i++ while $i &lt;= 10;
    print $j++ until $j &gt;  10;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;while&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;until&quot;</span> modifiers have the usual
    &quot;<span class="Li">&quot;while&quot;</span> loop&quot; semantics
    (conditional evaluated first), except when applied to a
    <span class="Li">&quot;do&quot;</span>-BLOCK (or to the Perl4
    <span class="Li">&quot;do&quot;</span>-SUBROUTINE statement), in which case
    the block executes once before the conditional is evaluated.</p>
<p class="Pp">This is so that you can write loops like:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    do {
        $line = &lt;STDIN&gt;;
        ...
    } until !defined($line) || $line eq &quot;.\n&quot;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">See &quot;do&quot; in perlfunc. Note also that the loop control
    statements described later will <i>NOT</i> work in this construct, because
    modifiers don't take loop labels. Sorry. You can always put another block
    inside of it (for
    <span class="Li">&quot;next&quot;</span>/<span class="Li">&quot;redo&quot;</span>)
    or around it (for <span class="Li">&quot;last&quot;</span>) to do that sort
    of thing.</p>
<p class="Pp">For <span class="Li">&quot;next&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;redo&quot;</span>, just double the braces:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    do {{
        next if $x == $y;
        # do something here
    }} until $x++ &gt; $z;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">For <span class="Li">&quot;last&quot;</span>, you have to be more
    elaborate and put braces around it:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    {
        do {
            last if $x == $y**2;
            # do something here
        } while $x++ &lt;= $z;
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If you need both <span class="Li">&quot;next&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;last&quot;</span>, you have to do both and also use a
    loop label:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    LOOP: {
        do {{
            next if $x == $y;
            last LOOP if $x == $y**2;
            # do something here
        }} until $x++ &gt; $z;
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><b>NOTE:</b> The behaviour of a
    <span class="Li">&quot;my&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;state&quot;</span>, or
    <span class="Li">&quot;our&quot;</span> modified with a statement modifier
    conditional or loop construct (for example, <span class="Li">&quot;my $x if
    ...&quot;</span>) is <b>undefined</b>. The value of the
    <span class="Li">&quot;my&quot;</span> variable may be
    <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span>, any previously assigned value, or
    possibly anything else. Don't rely on it. Future versions of perl might do
    something different from the version of perl you try it out on. Here be
    dragons.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;when&quot;</span> modifier is an
    experimental feature that first appeared in Perl 5.14. To use it, you should
    include a <span class="Li">&quot;use v5.14&quot;</span> declaration.
    (Technically, it requires only the
    <span class="Li">&quot;switch&quot;</span> feature, but that aspect of it
    was not available before 5.14.) Operative only from within a
    <span class="Li">&quot;foreach&quot;</span> loop or a
    <span class="Li">&quot;given&quot;</span> block, it executes the statement
    only if the smartmatch <span class="Li">&quot;$_ ~~
    </span><span class="Li"><i>EXPR</i></span><span class="Li">&quot;</span> is
    true. If the statement executes, it is followed by a
    <span class="Li">&quot;next&quot;</span> from inside a
    <span class="Li">&quot;foreach&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;break&quot;</span> from inside a
    <span class="Li">&quot;given&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Under the current implementation, the
    <span class="Li">&quot;foreach&quot;</span> loop can be anywhere within the
    <span class="Li">&quot;when&quot;</span> modifier's dynamic scope, but must
    be within the <span class="Li">&quot;given&quot;</span> block's lexical
    scope. This restriction may be relaxed in a future release. See &quot;Switch
    Statements&quot; below.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Compound_Statements"><a class="permalink" href="#Compound_Statements">Compound
  Statements</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">In Perl, a sequence of statements that defines a scope is called a
    block. Sometimes a block is delimited by the file containing it (in the case
    of a required file, or the program as a whole), and sometimes a block is
    delimited by the extent of a string (in the case of an eval).</p>
<p class="Pp">But generally, a block is delimited by curly brackets, also known
    as braces. We will call this syntactic construct a BLOCK. Because enclosing
    braces are also the syntax for hash reference constructor expressions (see
    perlref), you may occasionally need to disambiguate by placing a
    <span class="Li">&quot;;&quot;</span> immediately after an opening brace so
    that Perl realises the brace is the start of a block. You will more
    frequently need to disambiguate the other way, by placing a
    <span class="Li">&quot;+&quot;</span> immediately before an opening brace to
    force it to be interpreted as a hash reference constructor expression. It is
    considered good style to use these disambiguating mechanisms liberally, not
    only when Perl would otherwise guess incorrectly.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following compound statements may be used to control flow:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    if (EXPR) BLOCK
    if (EXPR) BLOCK else BLOCK
    if (EXPR) BLOCK elsif (EXPR) BLOCK ...
    if (EXPR) BLOCK elsif (EXPR) BLOCK ... else BLOCK
    unless (EXPR) BLOCK
    unless (EXPR) BLOCK else BLOCK
    unless (EXPR) BLOCK elsif (EXPR) BLOCK ...
    unless (EXPR) BLOCK elsif (EXPR) BLOCK ... else BLOCK
    given (EXPR) BLOCK
    LABEL while (EXPR) BLOCK
    LABEL while (EXPR) BLOCK continue BLOCK
    LABEL until (EXPR) BLOCK
    LABEL until (EXPR) BLOCK continue BLOCK
    LABEL for (EXPR; EXPR; EXPR) BLOCK
    LABEL for VAR (LIST) BLOCK
    LABEL for VAR (LIST) BLOCK continue BLOCK
    LABEL foreach (EXPR; EXPR; EXPR) BLOCK
    LABEL foreach VAR (LIST) BLOCK
    LABEL foreach VAR (LIST) BLOCK continue BLOCK
    LABEL BLOCK
    LABEL BLOCK continue BLOCK
    PHASE BLOCK
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If enabled by the experimental
    <span class="Li">&quot;try&quot;</span> feature, the following may also be
    used</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    try BLOCK catch (VAR) BLOCK
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The experimental <span class="Li">&quot;given&quot;</span>
    statement is <i>not automatically enabled</i>; see &quot;Switch
    Statements&quot; below for how to do so, and the attendant caveats.</p>
<p class="Pp">Unlike in C and Pascal, in Perl these are all defined in terms of
    BLOCKs, not statements. This means that the curly brackets are
    <i>required</i>--no dangling statements allowed. If you want to write
    conditionals without curly brackets, there are several other ways to do it.
    The following all do the same thing:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    if (!open(FOO)) { die &quot;Can't open $FOO: $!&quot; }
    die &quot;Can't open $FOO: $!&quot; unless open(FOO);
    open(FOO)  || die &quot;Can't open $FOO: $!&quot;;
    open(FOO) ? () : die &quot;Can't open $FOO: $!&quot;;
        # a bit exotic, that last one
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;if&quot;</span> statement is
    straightforward. Because BLOCKs are always bounded by curly brackets, there
    is never any ambiguity about which <span class="Li">&quot;if&quot;</span> an
    <span class="Li">&quot;else&quot;</span> goes with. If you use
    <span class="Li">&quot;unless&quot;</span> in place of
    <span class="Li">&quot;if&quot;</span>, the sense of the test is reversed.
    Like <span class="Li">&quot;if&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;unless&quot;</span> can be followed by
    <span class="Li">&quot;else&quot;</span>.
    <span class="Li">&quot;unless&quot;</span> can even be followed by one or
    more <span class="Li">&quot;elsif&quot;</span> statements, though you may
    want to think twice before using that particular language construct, as
    everyone reading your code will have to think at least twice before they can
    understand what's going on.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;while&quot;</span> statement executes
    the block as long as the expression is true. The
    <span class="Li">&quot;until&quot;</span> statement executes the block as
    long as the expression is false. The LABEL is optional, and if present,
    consists of an identifier followed by a colon. The LABEL identifies the loop
    for the loop control statements <span class="Li">&quot;next&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;last&quot;</span>, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;redo&quot;</span>. If the LABEL is omitted, the loop
    control statement refers to the innermost enclosing loop. This may include
    dynamically searching through your call-stack at run time to find the LABEL.
    Such desperate behavior triggers a warning if you use the
    <span class="Li">&quot;use warnings&quot;</span> pragma or the <b>-w</b>
    flag.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the condition expression of a
    <span class="Li">&quot;while&quot;</span> statement is based on any of a
    group of iterative expression types then it gets some magic treatment. The
    affected iterative expression types are
    <span class="Li">&quot;readline&quot;</span>, the
    <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;FILEHANDLE&gt;&quot;</span> input operator,
    <span class="Li">&quot;readdir&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;glob&quot;</span>, the
    <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;PATTERN&gt;&quot;</span> globbing operator, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;each&quot;</span>. If the condition expression is one
    of these expression types, then the value yielded by the iterative operator
    will be implicitly assigned to <span class="Li">$_</span>. If the condition
    expression is one of these expression types or an explicit assignment of one
    of them to a scalar, then the condition actually tests for definedness of
    the expression's value, not for its regular truth value.</p>
<p class="Pp">If there is a <span class="Li">&quot;continue&quot;</span> BLOCK,
    it is always executed just before the conditional is about to be evaluated
    again. Thus it can be used to increment a loop variable, even when the loop
    has been continued via the <span class="Li">&quot;next&quot;</span>
    statement.</p>
<p class="Pp">When a block is preceded by a compilation phase keyword such as
    <span class="Li">&quot;BEGIN&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;END&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;INIT&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;CHECK&quot;</span>, or
    <span class="Li">&quot;UNITCHECK&quot;</span>, then the block will run only
    during the corresponding phase of execution. See perlmod for more
  details.</p>
<p class="Pp">Extension modules can also hook into the Perl parser to define new
    kinds of compound statements. These are introduced by a keyword which the
    extension recognizes, and the syntax following the keyword is defined
    entirely by the extension. If you are an implementor, see
    &quot;PL_keyword_plugin&quot; in perlapi for the mechanism. If you are using
    such a module, see the module's documentation for details of the syntax that
    it defines.</p>

<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;next&quot;</span> command starts the

<h2 class="Ss" id="Foreach_Loops"><a class="permalink" href="#Foreach_Loops">Foreach
  Loops</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;foreach&quot;</span> loop iterates over
    a normal list value and sets the scalar variable VAR to be each element of
    the list in turn. If the variable is preceded with the keyword
    <span class="Li">&quot;my&quot;</span>, then it is lexically scoped, and is
    therefore visible only within the loop. Otherwise, the variable is
    implicitly local to the loop and regains its former value upon exiting the
    loop. If the variable was previously declared with
    <span class="Li">&quot;my&quot;</span>, it uses that variable instead of the
    global one, but it's still localized to the loop. This implicit localization
    occurs <i>only</i> in a <span class="Li">&quot;foreach&quot;</span>
  loop.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;foreach&quot;</span> keyword is
    actually a synonym for the <span class="Li">&quot;for&quot;</span> keyword,
    so you can use either. If VAR is omitted, <span class="Li">$_</span> is set
    to each value.</p>
<p class="Pp">If any element of LIST is an lvalue, you can modify it by
    modifying VAR inside the loop. Conversely, if any element of LIST is NOT an
    lvalue, any attempt to modify that element will fail. In other words, the
    <span class="Li">&quot;foreach&quot;</span> loop index variable is an
    implicit alias for each item in the list that you're looping over.</p>
<p class="Pp">If any part of LIST is an array,
    <span class="Li">&quot;foreach&quot;</span> will get very confused if you
    add or remove elements within the loop body, for example with
    <span class="Li">&quot;splice&quot;</span>. So don't do that.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;foreach&quot;</span> probably won't do what
    you expect if VAR is a tied or other special variable. Don't do that
  either.</p>
<p class="Pp">As of Perl 5.22, there is an experimental variant of this loop
    that accepts a variable preceded by a backslash for VAR, in which case the
    items in the LIST must be references. The backslashed variable will become
    an alias to each referenced item in the LIST, which must be of the correct
    type. The variable needn't be a scalar in this case, and the backslash may
    be followed by <span class="Li">&quot;my&quot;</span>. To use this form, you
    must enable the <span class="Li">&quot;refaliasing&quot;</span> feature via
    <span class="Li">&quot;use feature&quot;</span>. (See feature. See also
    &quot;Assigning to References&quot; in perlref.)</p>
<p class="Pp">Examples:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    for (@ary) { s/foo/bar/ }
    for my $elem (@elements) {
        $elem *= 2;
    }

        print $count, &quot;\n&quot;;
        sleep(1);
    }
    for (1..15) { print &quot;Merry Christmas\n&quot;; }
    foreach $item (split(/:[\\\n:]*/, $ENV{TERMCAP})) {
        print &quot;Item: $item\n&quot;;
    }
    use feature &quot;refaliasing&quot;;
    no warnings &quot;experimental::refaliasing&quot;;
    foreach \my %hash (@array_of_hash_references) {
        # do something which each %hash
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Here's how a C programmer might code up a particular algorithm in
    Perl:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    for (my $i = 0; $i &lt; @ary1; $i++) {
        for (my $j = 0; $j &lt; @ary2; $j++) {
            if ($ary1[$i] &gt; $ary2[$j]) {
                last; # can't go to outer :-(
            }
            $ary1[$i] += $ary2[$j];
        }
        # this is where that last takes me
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Whereas here's how a Perl programmer more comfortable with the
    idiom might do it:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    OUTER: for my $wid (@ary1) {
    INNER:   for my $jet (@ary2) {
                next OUTER if $wid &gt; $jet;
                $wid += $jet;
             }
          }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">See how much easier this is? It's cleaner, safer, and faster. It's
    cleaner because it's less noisy. It's safer because if code gets added
    between the inner and outer loops later on, the new code won't be
    accidentally executed. The <span class="Li">&quot;next&quot;</span>
    explicitly iterates the other loop rather than merely terminating the inner
    one. And it's faster because Perl executes a
    <span class="Li">&quot;foreach&quot;</span> statement more rapidly than it
    would the equivalent C-style <span class="Li">&quot;for&quot;</span>
  loop.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perceptive Perl hackers may have noticed that a
    <span class="Li">&quot;for&quot;</span> loop has a return value, and that
    this value can be captured by wrapping the loop in a
    <span class="Li">&quot;do&quot;</span> block. The reward for this discovery
    is this cautionary advice: The return value of a
    <span class="Li">&quot;for&quot;</span> loop is unspecified and may change
    without notice. Do not rely on it.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Try_Catch_Exception_Handling"><a class="permalink" href="#Try_Catch_Exception_Handling">Try
  Catch Exception Handling</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The
    <span class="Li">&quot;try&quot;</span>/<span class="Li">&quot;catch&quot;</span>
    syntax provides control flow relating to exception handling. The
    <span class="Li">&quot;try&quot;</span> keyword introduces a block which
    will be executed when it is encountered, and the
    <span class="Li">&quot;catch&quot;</span> block provides code to handle any
    exception that may be thrown by the first.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    try {
        my $x = call_a_function();
        $x &lt; 100 or die &quot;Too big&quot;;
        send_output($x);
    }
    catch ($e) {
        warn &quot;Unable to output a value; $e&quot;;
    }
    print &quot;Finished\n&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Here, the body of the <span class="Li">&quot;catch&quot;</span>
    block (i.e. the <span class="Li">&quot;warn&quot;</span> statement) will be
    executed if the initial block invokes the conditional
    <span class="Li">&quot;die&quot;</span>, or if either of the functions it
    invokes throws an uncaught exception. The
    <span class="Li">&quot;catch&quot;</span> block can inspect the
    <span class="Li">$e</span> lexical variable in this case to see what the
    exception was. If no exception was thrown then the
    <span class="Li">&quot;catch&quot;</span> block does not happen. In either
    case, execution will then continue from the following statement - in this
    example the <span class="Li">&quot;print&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;catch&quot;</span> keyword must be
    immediately followed by a variable declaration in parentheses, which
    introduces a new variable visible to the body of the subsequent block.
    Inside the block this variable will contain the exception value that was
    thrown by the code in the <span class="Li">&quot;try&quot;</span> block. It
    is not necessary to use the <span class="Li">&quot;my&quot;</span> keyword
    to declare this variable; this is implied (similar as it is for subroutine
    signatures).</p>
<p class="Pp">Both the <span class="Li">&quot;try&quot;</span> and the
    <span class="Li">&quot;catch&quot;</span> blocks are permitted to contain
    control-flow expressions, such as
    <span class="Li">&quot;return&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;goto&quot;</span>, or
    <span class="Li">&quot;next&quot;</span>/<span class="Li">&quot;last&quot;</span>/<span class="Li">&quot;redo&quot;</span>.
    In all cases they behave as expected without warnings. In particular, a
    <span class="Li">&quot;return&quot;</span> expression inside the
    <span class="Li">&quot;try&quot;</span> block will make its entire
    containing function return - this is in contrast to its behaviour inside an
    <span class="Li">&quot;eval&quot;</span> block, where it would only make
    that block return.</p>
<p class="Pp">Like other control-flow syntax,
    <span class="Li">&quot;try&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;catch&quot;</span> will yield the last evaluated
    value when placed as the final statement in a function or a
    <span class="Li">&quot;do&quot;</span> block. This permits the syntax to be
    used to create a value. In this case remember not to use the
    <span class="Li">&quot;return&quot;</span> expression, or that will cause
    the containing function to return.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    my $value = do {
        try {
            get_thing(@args);
        }
        catch ($e) {
            warn &quot;Unable to get thing - $e&quot;;
            $DEFAULT_THING;
        }
    };
</pre>
<p class="Pp">As with other control-flow syntax,
    <span class="Li">&quot;try&quot;</span> blocks are not visible to
    <span class="Li">&quot;caller()&quot;</span> (just as for example,
    <span class="Li">&quot;while&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;foreach&quot;</span> loops are not). Successive
    levels of the <span class="Li">&quot;caller&quot;</span> result can see
    subroutine calls and <span class="Li">&quot;eval&quot;</span> blocks,
    because those affect the way that <span class="Li">&quot;return&quot;</span>
    would work. Since <span class="Li">&quot;try&quot;</span> blocks do not
    intercept <span class="Li">&quot;return&quot;</span>, they are not of
    interest to <span class="Li">&quot;caller&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">This syntax is currently experimental and must be enabled with
    <span class="Li">&quot;use feature 'try'&quot;</span>. It emits a warning in
    the <span class="Li">&quot;experimental::try&quot;</span> category.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Basic_BLOCKs"><a class="permalink" href="#Basic_BLOCKs">Basic
  BLOCKs</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">A BLOCK by itself (labeled or not) is semantically equivalent to a
    loop that executes once. Thus you can use any of the loop control statements
    in it to leave or restart the block. (Note that this is <i>NOT</i> true in
    <span class="Li">&quot;eval{}&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;sub{}&quot;</span>, or contrary to popular belief
    <span class="Li">&quot;do{}&quot;</span> blocks, which do <i>NOT</i> count
    as loops.) The <span class="Li">&quot;continue&quot;</span> block is
    optional.</p>
<p class="Pp">The BLOCK construct can be used to emulate case structures.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    SWITCH: {
        if (/^abc/) { $abc = 1; last SWITCH; }
        if (/^def/) { $def = 1; last SWITCH; }
        if (/^xyz/) { $xyz = 1; last SWITCH; }
        $nothing = 1;
    }

<p class="Pp">You'll also find that <span class="Li">&quot;foreach&quot;</span>

        if (/^xyz/) { $xyz = 1; last SWITCH; }
        $nothing = 1;
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Such constructs are quite frequently used, both because older
    versions of Perl had no official <span class="Li">&quot;switch&quot;</span>
    statement, and also because the new version described immediately below
    remains experimental and can sometimes be confusing.</p>

<p class="Pp">Starting from Perl 5.10.1 (well, 5.10.0, but it didn't work
    right), you can say</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    use feature &quot;switch&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">to enable an experimental switch feature. This is loosely based on
    an old version of a Raku proposal, but it no longer resembles the Raku
    construct. You also get the switch feature whenever you declare that your
    code prefers to run under a version of Perl that is 5.10 or later. For
    example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    use v5.14;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Under the &quot;switch&quot; feature, Perl gains the experimental

    <span class="Li">&quot;when&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;default&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;continue&quot;</span>, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;break&quot;</span>. Starting from Perl 5.16, one can
    prefix the switch keywords with <span class="Li">&quot;CORE::&quot;</span>
    to access the feature without a <span class="Li">&quot;use
    feature&quot;</span> statement. The keywords
    <span class="Li">&quot;given&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;when&quot;</span> are analogous to
    <span class="Li">&quot;switch&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;case&quot;</span> in other languages -- though
    <span class="Li">&quot;continue&quot;</span> is not -- so the code in the
    previous section could be rewritten as</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    use v5.10.1;
    for ($var) {
        when (/^abc/) { $abc = 1 }
        when (/^def/) { $def = 1 }

<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;foreach&quot;</span> is the

<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    use v5.10.1;

        $def = 1 when /^def/;

<p class="Pp">The arguments to <span class="Li">&quot;given&quot;</span> and

    <span class="Li">$_</span> variable its topic value.</p>
<p class="Pp">Exactly what the <i>EXPR</i> argument to
    <span class="Li">&quot;when&quot;</span> does is hard to describe precisely,
    but in general, it tries to guess what you want done. Sometimes it is
    interpreted as <span class="Li">&quot;$_ ~~
    </span><span class="Li"><i>EXPR</i></span><span class="Li">&quot;</span>,
    and sometimes it is not. It also behaves differently when lexically enclosed
    by a <span class="Li">&quot;given&quot;</span> block than it does when
    dynamically enclosed by a <span class="Li">&quot;foreach&quot;</span> loop.
    The rules are far too difficult to understand to be described here. See
    &quot;Experimental Details on given and when&quot; later on.</p>
<p class="Pp">Due to an unfortunate bug in how
    <span class="Li">&quot;given&quot;</span> was implemented between Perl 5.10
    and 5.16, under those implementations the version of
    <span class="Li">$_</span> governed by
    <span class="Li">&quot;given&quot;</span> is merely a lexically scoped copy
    of the original, not a dynamically scoped alias to the original, as it would
    be if it were a <span class="Li">&quot;foreach&quot;</span> or under both
    the original and the current Raku language specification. This bug was fixed
    in Perl 5.18 (and lexicalized <span class="Li">$_</span> itself was removed
    in Perl 5.24).</p>
<p class="Pp">If your code still needs to run on older versions, stick to

<h2 class="Ss" id="Goto"><a class="permalink" href="#Goto">Goto</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Although not for the faint of heart, Perl does support a
    <span class="Li">&quot;goto&quot;</span> statement. There are three forms:
    <span class="Li">&quot;goto&quot;</span>-LABEL,
    <span class="Li">&quot;goto&quot;</span>-EXPR, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;goto&quot;</span>-&amp;NAME. A loop's LABEL is not
    actually a valid target for a <span class="Li">&quot;goto&quot;</span>; it's
    just the name of the loop.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;goto&quot;</span>-LABEL form finds the
    statement labeled with LABEL and resumes execution there. It may not be used
    to go into any construct that requires initialization, such as a subroutine
    or a <span class="Li">&quot;foreach&quot;</span> loop. It also can't be used
    to go into a construct that is optimized away. It can be used to go almost
    anywhere else within the dynamic scope, including out of subroutines, but
    it's usually better to use some other construct such as
    <span class="Li">&quot;last&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;die&quot;</span>. The author of Perl has never felt
    the need to use this form of <span class="Li">&quot;goto&quot;</span> (in
    Perl, that is--C is another matter).</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;goto&quot;</span>-EXPR form expects a
    label name, whose scope will be resolved dynamically. This allows for
    computed <span class="Li">&quot;goto&quot;</span>s per FORTRAN, but isn't
    necessarily recommended if you're optimizing for maintainability:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    goto((&quot;FOO&quot;, &quot;BAR&quot;, &quot;GLARCH&quot;)[$i]);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;goto&quot;</span>-&amp;NAME form is
    highly magical, and substitutes a call to the named subroutine for the
    currently running subroutine. This is used by
    <span class="Li">&quot;AUTOLOAD()&quot;</span> subroutines that wish to load
    another subroutine and then pretend that the other subroutine had been
    called in the first place (except that any modifications to
    <span class="Li">@_</span> in the current subroutine are propagated to the
    other subroutine.) After the <span class="Li">&quot;goto&quot;</span>, not
    even <span class="Li">&quot;caller()&quot;</span> will be able to tell that
    this routine was called first.</p>
<p class="Pp">In almost all cases like this, it's usually a far, far better idea
    to use the structured control flow mechanisms of
    <span class="Li">&quot;next&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;last&quot;</span>, or
    <span class="Li">&quot;redo&quot;</span> instead of resorting to a
    <span class="Li">&quot;goto&quot;</span>. For certain applications, the
    catch and throw pair of <span class="Li">&quot;eval{}&quot;</span> and
    <b>die()</b> for exception processing can also be a prudent approach.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="The_Ellipsis_Statement"><a class="permalink" href="#The_Ellipsis_Statement">The
  Ellipsis Statement</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Beginning in Perl 5.12, Perl accepts an ellipsis,
    &quot;<span class="Li">&quot;...&quot;</span>&quot;, as a placeholder for
    code that you haven't implemented yet. When Perl 5.12 or later encounters an
    ellipsis statement, it parses this without error, but if and when you should
    actually try to execute it, Perl throws an exception with the text
    <span class="Li">&quot;Unimplemented&quot;</span>:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    use v5.12;
    sub unimplemented { ... }
    eval { unimplemented() };
    if ($@ =~ /^Unimplemented at /) {
        say &quot;I found an ellipsis!&quot;;
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">You can only use the elliptical statement to stand in for a
    complete statement. Syntactically,
    &quot;<span class="Li">&quot;...;&quot;</span>&quot; is a complete
    statement, but, as with other kinds of semicolon-terminated statement, the
    semicolon may be omitted if
    &quot;<span class="Li">&quot;...&quot;</span>&quot; appears immediately
    before a closing brace. These examples show how the ellipsis works:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    use v5.12;
    { ... }
    sub foo { ... }
    ...;
    eval { ... };
    sub somemeth {
        my $self = shift;
        ...;
    }
    $x = do {
        my $n;
        ...;
        say &quot;Hurrah!&quot;;
        $n;
    };
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The elliptical statement cannot stand in for an expression that is
    part of a larger statement. These examples of attempts to use an ellipsis
    are syntax errors:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    use v5.12;
    print ...;
    open(my $fh, &quot;&gt;&quot;, &quot;/dev/passwd&quot;) or ...;
    if ($condition &amp;&amp; ... ) { say &quot;Howdy&quot; };
    ... if $a &gt; $b;
    say &quot;Cromulent&quot; if ...;
    $flub = 5 + ...;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">There are some cases where Perl can't immediately tell the
    difference between an expression and a statement. For instance, the syntax
    for a block and an anonymous hash reference constructor look the same unless
    there's something in the braces to give Perl a hint. The ellipsis is a
    syntax error if Perl doesn't guess that the <span class="Li">&quot;{ ...
    }&quot;</span> is a block. Inside your block, you can use a
    <span class="Li">&quot;;&quot;</span> before the ellipsis to denote that the
    <span class="Li">&quot;{ ... }&quot;</span> is a block and not a hash
    reference constructor.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note: Some folks colloquially refer to this bit of punctuation as
    a &quot;yada-yada&quot; or &quot;triple-dot&quot;, but its true name is
    actually an ellipsis.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="PODs:_Embedded_Documentation"><a class="permalink" href="#PODs:_Embedded_Documentation">PODs:
  Embedded Documentation</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Perl has a mechanism for intermixing documentation with source
    code. While it's expecting the beginning of a new statement, if the compiler
    encounters a line that begins with an equal sign and a word, like this</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    =head1 Here There Be Pods!
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Then that text and all remaining text up through and including a
    line beginning with <span class="Li">&quot;=cut&quot;</span> will be
    ignored. The format of the intervening text is described in perlpod.</p>
<p class="Pp">This allows you to intermix your source code and your
    documentation text freely, as in</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    =item snazzle($)
    The snazzle() function will behave in the most spectacular
    form that you can possibly imagine, not even excepting
    cybernetic pyrotechnics.
    =cut back to the compiler, nuff of this pod stuff!
    sub snazzle($) {
        my $thingie = shift;
        .........
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Note that pod translators should look at only paragraphs beginning
    with a pod directive (it makes parsing easier), whereas the compiler
    actually knows to look for pod escapes even in the middle of a paragraph.
    This means that the following secret stuff will be ignored by both the
    compiler and the translators.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    $a=3;
    =secret stuff
     warn &quot;Neither POD nor CODE!?&quot;
    =cut back
    print &quot;got $a\n&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">You probably shouldn't rely upon the
    <span class="Li">&quot;warn()&quot;</span> being podded out forever. Not all
    pod translators are well-behaved in this regard, and perhaps the compiler
    will become pickier.</p>
<p class="Pp">One may also use pod directives to quickly comment out a section
    of code.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Plain_Old_Comments_(Not!)"><a class="permalink" href="#Plain_Old_Comments_(Not!)">Plain
  Old Comments (Not!)</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Perl can process line directives, much like the C preprocessor.
    Using this, one can control Perl's idea of filenames and line numbers in
    error or warning messages (especially for strings that are processed with
    <span class="Li">&quot;eval()&quot;</span>). The syntax for this mechanism
    is almost the same as for most C preprocessors: it matches the regular
    expression</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    # example: '# line 42 &quot;new_filename.plx&quot;'
    /^\#   \s*
      line \s+ (\d+)   \s*
      (?:\s(&quot;?)([^&quot;]+)\g2)? \s*
     $/x
</pre>
<p class="Pp">with <span class="Li">$1</span> being the line number for the next
    line, and <span class="Li">$3</span> being the optional filename (specified
    with or without quotes). Note that no whitespace may precede the
    <span class="Li">&quot;#&quot;</span>, unlike modern C preprocessors.</p>
<p class="Pp">There is a fairly obvious gotcha included with the line directive:
    Debuggers and profilers will only show the last source line to appear at a
    particular line number in a given file. Care should be taken not to cause
    line number collisions in code you'd like to debug later.</p>
<p class="Pp">Here are some examples that you should be able to type into your
    command shell:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    % perl
    # line 200 &quot;bzzzt&quot;
    # the '#' on the previous line must be the first char on line
    die 'foo';
    __END__
    foo at bzzzt line 201.

  Details on given and when</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">As previously mentioned, the &quot;switch&quot; feature is
    considered highly experimental; it is subject to change with little notice.
    In particular, <span class="Li">&quot;when&quot;</span> has tricky
    behaviours that are expected to change to become less tricky in the future.
    Do not rely upon its current (mis)implementation. Before Perl 5.18,
    <span class="Li">&quot;given&quot;</span> also had tricky behaviours that
    you should still beware of if your code must run on older versions of
  Perl.</p>
<p class="Pp">Here is a longer example of
    <span class="Li">&quot;given&quot;</span>:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    use feature &quot;:5.10&quot;;

        }
        default {
            die q(I don't know what to do with $foo);
        }
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Before Perl 5.18, <span class="Li">&quot;given(EXPR)&quot;</span>
    assigned the value of <i>EXPR</i> to merely a lexically scoped
    <i></i><b><i>copy</i></b><i></i> (!) of <span class="Li">$_</span>, not a
    dynamically scoped alias the way <span class="Li">&quot;foreach&quot;</span>
    does. That made it similar to</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        do { my $_ = EXPR; ... }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">except that the block was automatically broken out of by a
    successful <span class="Li">&quot;when&quot;</span> or an explicit
    <span class="Li">&quot;break&quot;</span>. Because it was only a copy, and
    because it was only lexically scoped, not dynamically scoped, you could not
    do the things with it that you are used to in a
    <span class="Li">&quot;foreach&quot;</span> loop. In particular, it did not
    work for arbitrary function calls if those functions might try to access
    <span class="Li">$_</span>. Best stick to
    <span class="Li">&quot;foreach&quot;</span> for that.</p>
<p class="Pp">Most of the power comes from the implicit smartmatching that can
    sometimes apply. Most of the time,
    <span class="Li">&quot;when(EXPR)&quot;</span> is treated as an implicit
    smartmatch of <span class="Li">$_</span>, that is, <span class="Li">&quot;$_
    ~~ EXPR&quot;</span>. (See &quot;Smartmatch Operator&quot; in perlop for
    more information on smartmatching.) But when <i>EXPR</i> is one of the 10
    exceptional cases (or things like them) listed below, it is used directly as
    a boolean.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>1.</dt>
  <dd>A user-defined subroutine call or a method invocation.</dd>
  <dt>2.</dt>
  <dd>A regular expression match in the form of

      =~ /REGEX/&quot;</span>, or <span class="Li">&quot;$foo =~
      EXPR&quot;</span>. Also, a negated regular expression match in the form
      <span class="Li">&quot;!/REGEX/&quot;</span>, <span class="Li">&quot;$foo
      !~ /REGEX/&quot;</span>, or <span class="Li">&quot;$foo !~
      EXPR&quot;</span>.</dd>
  <dt>3.</dt>
  <dd>A smart match that uses an explicit <span class="Li">&quot;~~&quot;</span>
      operator, such as <span class="Li">&quot;EXPR ~~ EXPR&quot;</span>.
    <p class="Pp"><b>NOTE:</b> You will often have to use
        <span class="Li">&quot;$c ~~ $_&quot;</span> because the default case

        the opposite of what you want.</p>

  <dt>4.</dt>
  <dd>A boolean comparison operator such as <span class="Li">&quot;$_ &lt;
      10&quot;</span> or <span class="Li">&quot;$x eq
      &quot;abc&quot;&quot;</span>. The relational operators that this applies
      to are the six numeric comparisons
      (<span class="Li">&quot;&lt;&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;&gt;&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;=&quot;</span>,

  <dt>6.</dt>
  <dd>A negated expression, whether <span class="Li">&quot;!(EXPR)&quot;</span>
      or <span class="Li">&quot;not(EXPR)&quot;</span>, or a logical

      bitwise versions (<span class="Li">&quot;~&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;^&quot;</span>) are not included.</dd>
  <dt>7.</dt>
  <dd>A filetest operator, with exactly 4 exceptions:
      <span class="Li">&quot;-s&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;-M&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;-A&quot;</span>, and
      <span class="Li">&quot;-C&quot;</span>, as these return numerical values,
      not boolean ones. The <span class="Li">&quot;-z&quot;</span> filetest
      operator is not included in the exception list.</dd>
  <dt>8.</dt>
  <dd>The <span class="Li">&quot;..&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;...&quot;</span> flip-flop operators. Note that the
      <span class="Li">&quot;...&quot;</span> flip-flop operator is completely
      different from the <span class="Li">&quot;...&quot;</span> elliptical
      statement just described.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">In those 8 cases above, the value of EXPR is used directly as a
    boolean, so no smartmatching is done. You may think of
    <span class="Li">&quot;when&quot;</span> as a smartsmartmatch.</p>
<p class="Pp">Furthermore, Perl inspects the operands of logical operators to
    decide whether to use smartmatching for each one by applying the above test
    to the operands:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>9.</dt>
  <dd>If EXPR is <span class="Li">&quot;EXPR1 &amp;&amp; EXPR2&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;EXPR1 and EXPR2&quot;</span>, the test is applied
      <i>recursively</i> to both EXPR1 and EXPR2. Only if <i>both</i> operands
      also pass the test, <i>recursively</i>, will the expression be treated as
      boolean. Otherwise, smartmatching is used.</dd>
  <dt>10.</dt>
  <dd>If EXPR is <span class="Li">&quot;EXPR1 || EXPR2&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;EXPR1 // EXPR2&quot;</span>, or
      <span class="Li">&quot;EXPR1 or EXPR2&quot;</span>, the test is applied
      <i>recursively</i> to EXPR1 only (which might itself be a
      higher-precedence AND operator, for example, and thus subject to the
      previous rule), not to EXPR2. If EXPR1 is to use smartmatching, then EXPR2
      also does so, no matter what EXPR2 contains. But if EXPR2 does not get to
      use smartmatching, then the second argument will not be either. This is
      quite different from the <span class="Li">&quot;&amp;&amp;&quot;</span>
      case just described, so be careful.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">These rules are complicated, but the goal is for them to do what
    you want (even if you don't quite understand why they are doing it). For
    example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    when (/^\d+$/ &amp;&amp; $_ &lt; 75) { ... }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">will be treated as a boolean match because the rules say both a
    regex match and an explicit test on <span class="Li">$_</span> will be
    treated as boolean.</p>
<p class="Pp">Also:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    when ([qw(foo bar)] &amp;&amp; /baz/) { ... }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">will use smartmatching because only <i>one</i> of the operands is
    a boolean: the other uses smartmatching, and that wins.</p>
<p class="Pp">Further:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    when ([qw(foo bar)] || /^baz/) { ... }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">will use smart matching (only the first operand is considered),
    whereas</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    when (/^baz/ || [qw(foo bar)]) { ... }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">will test only the regex, which causes both operands to be treated
    as boolean. Watch out for this one, then, because an arrayref is always a
    true value, which makes it effectively redundant. Not a good idea.</p>
<p class="Pp">Tautologous boolean operators are still going to be optimized
    away. Don't be tempted to write</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    when (&quot;foo&quot; or &quot;bar&quot;) { ... }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This will optimize down to
    <span class="Li">&quot;foo&quot;</span>, so
    <span class="Li">&quot;bar&quot;</span> will never be considered (even
    though the rules say to use a smartmatch on
    <span class="Li">&quot;foo&quot;</span>). For an alternation like this, an
    array ref will work, because this will instigate smartmatching:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    when ([qw(foo bar)] { ... }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This is somewhat equivalent to the C-style switch statement's
    fallthrough functionality (not to be confused with <i>Perl's</i> fallthrough
    functionality--see below), wherein the same block is used for several
    <span class="Li">&quot;case&quot;</span> statements.</p>
<p class="Pp">Another useful shortcut is that, if you use a literal array or
    hash as the argument to <span class="Li">&quot;given&quot;</span>, it is
    turned into a reference. So <span class="Li">&quot;given(@foo)&quot;</span>
    is the same as <span class="Li">&quot;given(\@foo)&quot;</span>, for
    example.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;default&quot;</span> behaves exactly like
    <span class="Li">&quot;when(1 == 1)&quot;</span>, which is to say that it
    always matches.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Breaking out</i></p>
<p class="Pp">You can use the <span class="Li">&quot;break&quot;</span> keyword
    to break out of the enclosing <span class="Li">&quot;given&quot;</span>
    block. Every <span class="Li">&quot;when&quot;</span> block is implicitly
    ended with a <span class="Li">&quot;break&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Fall-through</i></p>
<p class="Pp">You can use the <span class="Li">&quot;continue&quot;</span>
    keyword to fall through from one case to the next immediate
    <span class="Li">&quot;when&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;default&quot;</span>:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    given($foo) {
        when (/x/) { say '$foo contains an x'; continue }
        when (/y/) { say '$foo contains a y'            }
        default    { say '$foo does not contain a y'    }
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><i>Return value</i></p>
<p class="Pp">When a <span class="Li">&quot;given&quot;</span> statement is also
    a valid expression (for example, when it's the last statement of a block),
    it evaluates to:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>An empty list as soon as an explicit
      <span class="Li">&quot;break&quot;</span> is encountered.</li>
  <li>The value of the last evaluated expression of the successful
      <span class="Li">&quot;when&quot;</span>/<span class="Li">&quot;default&quot;</span>
      clause, if there happens to be one.</li>
  <li>The value of the last evaluated expression of the
      <span class="Li">&quot;given&quot;</span> block if no condition is
    true.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">In both last cases, the last expression is evaluated in the
    context that was applied to the <span class="Li">&quot;given&quot;</span>
    block.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that, unlike <span class="Li">&quot;if&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;unless&quot;</span>, failed
    <span class="Li">&quot;when&quot;</span> statements always evaluate to an
    empty list.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    my $price = do {
        given ($item) {
            when ([&quot;pear&quot;, &quot;apple&quot;]) { 1 }
            break when &quot;vote&quot;;      # My vote cannot be bought

<p class="Pp">Currently, <span class="Li">&quot;given&quot;</span> blocks can't
    always be used as proper expressions. This may be addressed in a future
    version of Perl.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Switching in a loop</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Instead of using <span class="Li">&quot;given()&quot;</span>, you
    can use a <span class="Li">&quot;foreach()&quot;</span> loop. For example,
    here's one way to count how many times a particular string occurs in an
    array:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    use v5.10.1;
    my $count = 0;
    for (@array) {
        when (&quot;foo&quot;) { ++$count }
    }
    print &quot;\@array contains $count copies of 'foo'\n&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Or in a more recent version:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    use v5.14;
    my $count = 0;
    for (@array) {
        ++$count when &quot;foo&quot;;
    }
    print &quot;\@array contains $count copies of 'foo'\n&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">At the end of all <span class="Li">&quot;when&quot;</span> blocks,
    there is an implicit <span class="Li">&quot;next&quot;</span>. You can
    override that with an explicit <span class="Li">&quot;last&quot;</span> if
    you're interested in only the first match alone.</p>
<p class="Pp">This doesn't work if you explicitly specify a loop variable, as in
    <span class="Li">&quot;for $item (@array)&quot;</span>. You have to use the
    default variable <span class="Li">$_</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Differences from Raku</i></p>
<p class="Pp">The Perl 5 smartmatch and
    <span class="Li">&quot;given&quot;</span>/<span class="Li">&quot;when&quot;</span>
    constructs are not compatible with their Raku analogues. The most visible
    difference and least important difference is that, in Perl 5, parentheses
    are required around the argument to
    <span class="Li">&quot;given()&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;when()&quot;</span> (except when this last one is
    used as a statement modifier). Parentheses in Raku are always optional in a
    control construct such as <span class="Li">&quot;if()&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;while()&quot;</span>, or
    <span class="Li">&quot;when()&quot;</span>; they can't be made optional in
    Perl 5 without a great deal of potential confusion, because Perl 5 would
    parse the expression</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    given $foo {
        ...
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">as though the argument to
    <span class="Li">&quot;given&quot;</span> were an element of the hash
    <span class="Li">%foo</span>, interpreting the braces as hash-element
    syntax.</p>
<p class="Pp">However, their are many, many other differences. For example, this
    works in Perl 5:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    use v5.12;
    my @primary = (&quot;red&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;, &quot;green&quot;);
    if (@primary ~~ &quot;red&quot;) {
        say &quot;primary smartmatches red&quot;;
    }
    if (&quot;red&quot; ~~ @primary) {
        say &quot;red smartmatches primary&quot;;
    }
    say &quot;that's all, folks!&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">But it doesn't work at all in Raku. Instead, you should use the
    (parallelizable) <span class="Li">&quot;any&quot;</span> operator:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>   if any(@primary) eq &quot;red&quot; {
       say &quot;primary smartmatches red&quot;;
   }
   if &quot;red&quot; eq any(@primary) {
       say &quot;red smartmatches primary&quot;;
   }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The table of smartmatches in &quot;Smartmatch Operator&quot; in
    perlop is not identical to that proposed by the Raku specification, mainly
    due to differences between Raku's and Perl 5's data models, but also because
    the Raku spec has changed since Perl 5 rushed into early adoption.</p>
<p class="Pp">In Raku, <span class="Li">&quot;when()&quot;</span> will always do
    an implicit smartmatch with its argument, while in Perl 5 it is convenient
    (albeit potentially confusing) to suppress this implicit smartmatch in
    various rather loosely-defined situations, as roughly outlined above. (The
    difference is largely because Perl 5 does not have, even internally, a
    boolean type.)</p>
