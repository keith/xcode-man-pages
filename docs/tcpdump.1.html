<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp"><i>Tcpdump</i> prints out a description of the contents of packets
    on a network interface that match the Boolean <i>expression</i>; the
    description is preceded by a time stamp, printed, by default, as hours,
    minutes, seconds, and fractions of a second since midnight. It can also be
    run with the <b>-w</b> flag, which causes it to save the packet data to a
    file for later analysis, and/or with the <b>-r</b> flag, which causes it to
    read from a saved packet file rather than to read packets from a network
    interface. It can also be run with the <b>-V</b> flag, which causes it to
    read a list of saved packet files. In all cases, only packets that match
    <i>expression</i> will be processed by <i>tcpdump</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Tcpdump</i> will, if not run with the <b>-c</b> flag, continue
    capturing packets until it is interrupted by a SIGINT signal (generated, for
    example, by typing your interrupt character, typically control-C) or a
    SIGTERM signal (typically generated with the <b>kill</b>(1) command); if run
    with the <b>-c</b> flag, it will capture packets until it is interrupted by
    a SIGINT or SIGTERM signal or the specified number of packets have been
    processed.</p>
<p class="Pp">When <i>tcpdump</i> finishes capturing packets, it will report
    counts of:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>packets ``captured'' (this is the number of packets that <i>tcpdump</i>
      has received and processed);</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>packets ``received by filter'' (the meaning of this depends on the OS on
      which you're running <i>tcpdump</i>, and possibly on the way the OS was
      configured - if a filter was specified on the command line, on some OSes
      it counts packets regardless of whether they were matched by the filter
      expression and, even if they were matched by the filter expression,
      regardless of whether <i>tcpdump</i> has read and processed them yet, on
      other OSes it counts only packets that were matched by the filter
      expression regardless of whether <i>tcpdump</i> has read and processed
      them yet, and on other OSes it counts only packets that were matched by
      the filter expression and were processed by <i>tcpdump</i>);</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>packets ``dropped by kernel'' (this is the number of packets that were
      dropped, due to a lack of buffer space, by the packet capture mechanism in
      the OS on which <i>tcpdump</i> is running, if the OS reports that
      information to applications; if not, it will be reported as 0).</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">On platforms that support the SIGINFO signal, such as most BSDs
    (including macOS) and Digital/Tru64 UNIX, it will report those counts when
    it receives a SIGINFO signal (generated, for example, by typing your
    ``status'' character, typically control-T, although on some platforms, such
    as macOS, the ``status'' character is not set by default, so you must set it
    with <b>stty</b>(1) in order to use it) and will continue capturing packets.
    On platforms that do not support the SIGINFO signal, the same can be
    achieved by using the SIGUSR1 signal.</p>
<p class="Pp">Using the SIGUSR2 signal along with the <b>-w</b> flag will
    forcibly flush the packet buffer into the output file.</p>
<p class="Pp">Reading packets from a network interface may require that you have
    special privileges; see the <b>pcap</b>(3PCAP) man page for details. Reading
    a saved packet file doesn't require special privileges.</p>

  <dd>Exit after receiving or displaying <i>count</i> packets.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>The second form allows to pass the number of initial packets to ignore
      with the <b>skip</b> parameter. The <b>skip</b> parameter is required
      before the comma but the <b>count</b> parameters is optional after the
      comma.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="count"><a class="permalink" href="#count"><b>--count</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Print only on stderr the packet count when reading capture file(s) instead
      of parsing/printing the packets. If a filter is specified on the command
      line, <i>tcpdump</i> counts only packets that were matched by the filter
      expression.</dd>
  <dt id="C"><a class="permalink" href="#C"><b>-C</b><i> file_size</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Before writing a raw packet to a savefile, check whether the file is
      currently larger than <i>file_size</i> and, if so, close the current
      savefile and open a new one. Savefiles after the first savefile will have
      the name specified with the <b>-w</b> flag, with a number after it,
      starting at 1 and continuing upward. The units of <i>file_size</i> are
      millions of bytes (1,000,000 bytes, not 1,048,576 bytes).</dd>
  <dt id="d"><a class="permalink" href="#d"><b>-d</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Dump the compiled packet-matching code in a human readable form to
      standard output and stop.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Please mind that although code compilation is always DLT-specific,
      typically it is impossible (and unnecessary) to specify which DLT to use
      for the dump because <i>tcpdump</i> uses either the DLT of the input pcap
      file specified with <b>-r</b>, or the default DLT of the network interface
      specified with <b>-i</b>, or the particular DLT of the network interface
      specified with <b>-y</b> and <b>-i</b> respectively. In these cases the
      dump shows the same exact code that would filter the input file or the
      network interface without <b>-d</b>.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>However, when neither <b>-r</b> nor <b>-i</b> is specified, specifying
      <b>-d</b> prevents <i>tcpdump</i> from guessing a suitable network
      interface (see <b>-i</b>). In this case the DLT defaults to EN10MB and can
      be set to another valid value manually with <b>-y</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="dd"><a class="permalink" href="#dd"><b>-dd</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Dump packet-matching code as a <b>C</b> program fragment.</dd>
  <dt id="ddd"><a class="permalink" href="#ddd"><b>-ddd</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Dump packet-matching code as decimal numbers (preceded with a count).</dd>

  <dd></dd>
  <dt id="list"><a class="permalink" href="#list"><b>--list-interfaces</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Print the list of the network interfaces available on the system and on
      which <i>tcpdump</i> can capture packets. For each network interface, a
      number and an interface name, possibly followed by a text description of
      the interface, are printed. The interface name or the number can be
      supplied to the <b>-i</b> flag to specify an interface on which to
      capture.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>This can be useful on systems that don't have a command to list them
      (e.g., Windows systems, or UNIX systems lacking <b>ifconfig -a</b>); the
      number can be useful on Windows 2000 and later systems, where the
      interface name is a somewhat complex string.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>The <b>-D</b> flag will not be supported if <i>tcpdump</i> was built with
      an older version of <i>libpcap</i> that lacks the
      <b>pcap_findalldevs(3PCAP)</b> function.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="e"><a class="permalink" href="#e"><b>-e</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Print the link-level header on each dump line. This can be used, for

      IEEE 802.11.</dd>

  <dd>Use <i>spi@ipaddr algo:secret</i> for decrypting IPsec ESP packets that
      are addressed to <i>addr</i> and contain Security Parameter Index value
      <i>spi</i>. This combination may be repeated with comma or newline
      separation.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">

  <dd>Note that setting the secret for IPv4 ESP packets is supported at this
      time.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Algorithms may be <b>des-cbc</b>, <b>3des-cbc</b>, <b>blowfish-cbc</b>,
      <b>rc3-cbc</b>, <b>cast128-cbc</b>, or <b>none</b>. The default is
      <b>des-cbc</b>. The ability to decrypt packets is only present if
      <i>tcpdump</i> was compiled with cryptography enabled.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd><i>secret</i> is the ASCII text for ESP secret key. If preceded by 0x,
      then a hex value will be read.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>The option assumes RFC2406 ESP, not RFC1827 ESP. The option is only for
      debugging purposes, and the use of this option with a true `secret' key is
      discouraged. By presenting IPsec secret key onto command line you make it
      visible to others, via <i>ps</i>(1) and other occasions.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>In addition to the above syntax, the syntax <i>file name</i> may be used
      to have tcpdump read the provided file in. The file is opened upon
      receiving the first ESP packet, so any special permissions that tcpdump
      may have been given should already have been given up.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="f"><a class="permalink" href="#f"><b>-f</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Print `foreign' IPv4 addresses numerically rather than symbolically (this
      option is intended to get around serious brain damage in Sun's NIS server
      &#x2014; usually it hangs forever translating non-local internet
    numbers).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>The test for `foreign' IPv4 addresses is done using the IPv4 address and
      netmask of the interface on which capture is being done. If that address
      or netmask are not available, available, either because the interface on
      which capture is being done has no address or netmask or because the
      capture is being done on the Linux &quot;any&quot; interface, which can
      capture on more than one interface, this option will not work
    correctly.</dd>

      <i>tcpdump</i> searches the system interface list for the lowest numbered,
      configured up interface (excluding loopback), which may turn out to be,
      for example, ``eth0''.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>On Linux systems with 2.2 or later kernels, an <i>interface</i> argument
      of ``any'' can be used to capture packets from all interfaces. Note that

  <dt></dt>
  <dd>On Darwin systems version 13 or later, when the <i>interface</i> is

      and tunnel interfaces).</dd>

  <dd>Alternatively, to capture on more than one interface at a time, one may

<h1 class="Sh" id="OUTPUT_FORMAT"><a class="permalink" href="#OUTPUT_FORMAT">OUTPUT
  FORMAT</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The output of <i>tcpdump</i> is protocol dependent. The following
    gives a brief description and examples of most of the formats.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Timestamps</b></p>
<p class="Pp">By default, all output lines are preceded by a timestamp. The
    timestamp is the current clock time in the form</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre><i>hh:mm:ss.frac</i></pre>
</div>
and is as accurate as the kernel's clock. The timestamp reflects the time the
  kernel applied a time stamp to the packet. No attempt is made to account for
  the time lag between when the network interface finished receiving the packet
  from the network and when the kernel applied a time stamp to the packet; that
  time lag could include a delay between the time when the network interface
  finished receiving a packet from the network and the time when an interrupt
  was delivered to the kernel to get it to read the packet and a delay between
  the time when the kernel serviced the `new packet' interrupt and the time when
  it applied a time stamp to the packet.
<p class="Pp"><b>Link Level Headers</b></p>
<p class="Pp">If the '-e' option is given, the link level header is printed out.
    On Ethernets, the source and destination addresses, protocol, and packet
    length are printed.</p>
<p class="Pp">On FDDI networks, the '-e' option causes <i>tcpdump</i> to print
    the `frame control' field, the source and destination addresses, and the
    packet length. (The `frame control' field governs the interpretation of the
    rest of the packet. Normal packets (such as those containing IP datagrams)
    are `async' packets, with a priority value between 0 and 7; for example,
    `<b>async4</b>'. Such packets are assumed to contain an 802.2 Logical Link
    Control (LLC) packet; the LLC header is printed if it is <i>not</i> an ISO
    datagram or a so-called SNAP packet.</p>
<p class="Pp">On Token Ring networks, the '-e' option causes <i>tcpdump</i> to
    print the `access control' and `frame control' fields, the source and
    destination addresses, and the packet length. As on FDDI networks, packets
    are assumed to contain an LLC packet. Regardless of whether the '-e' option
    is specified or not, the source routing information is printed for
    source-routed packets.</p>
<p class="Pp">On 802.11 networks, the '-e' option causes <i>tcpdump</i> to print
    the `frame control' fields, all of the addresses in the 802.11 header, and
    the packet length. As on FDDI networks, packets are assumed to contain an
    LLC packet.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>(N.B.: The following description assumes familiarity with</i>
    <i>the SLIP compression algorithm described in RFC-1144.)</i></p>
<p class="Pp">On SLIP links, a direction indicator (``I'' for inbound, ``O'' for
    outbound), packet type, and compression information are printed out. The
    packet type is printed first. The three types are <i>ip</i>, <i>utcp</i>,
    and <i>ctcp</i>. No further link information is printed for <i>ip</i>
    packets. For TCP packets, the connection identifier is printed following the
    type. If the packet is compressed, its encoded header is printed out. The
    special cases are printed out as <b>*S+</b><i>n</i> and <b>*SA+</b><i>n</i>,
    where <i>n</i> is the amount by which the sequence number (or sequence
    number and ack) has changed. If it is not a special case, zero or more
    changes are printed. A change is indicated by U (urgent pointer), W
    (window), A (ack), S (sequence number), and I (packet ID), followed by a
    delta (+n or -n), or a new value (=n). Finally, the amount of data in the
    packet and compressed header length are printed.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, the following line shows an outbound compressed TCP
    packet, with an implicit connection identifier; the ack has changed by 6,
    the sequence number by 49, and the packet ID by 6; there are 3 bytes of data
    and 6 bytes of compressed header:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre><b>O ctcp * A+6 S+49 I+6 3 (6)</b></pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>ARP/RARP Packets</b></p>
<p class="Pp">ARP/RARP output shows the type of request and its arguments. The
    format is intended to be self explanatory. Here is a short sample taken from
    the start of an `rlogin' from host <i>rtsg</i> to host <i>csam</i>:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<span class="Li">arp who-has csam tell rtsg</span>
<span class="Li">arp reply csam is-at CSAM</span>

</pre>
</div>
The first line says that rtsg sent an ARP packet asking for the Ethernet address
  of internet host csam. Csam replies with its Ethernet address (in this
  example, Ethernet addresses are in caps and internet addresses in lower case).
<p class="Pp">This would look less redundant if we had done <i>tcpdump
  -n</i>:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<span class="Li">arp who-has 128.3.254.6 tell 128.3.254.68</span>
<span class="Li">arp reply 128.3.254.6 is-at 02:07:01:00:01:c4</span></pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">If we had done <i>tcpdump -e</i>, the fact that the first packet
    is broadcast and the second is point-to-point would be visible:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<span class="Li">RTSG Broadcast 0806  64: arp who-has csam tell rtsg</span>
<span class="Li">CSAM RTSG 0806  64: arp reply csam is-at CSAM</span>

</pre>
</div>
For the first packet this says the Ethernet source address is RTSG, the
  destination is the Ethernet broadcast address, the type field contained hex
  0806 (type ETHER_ARP) and the total length was 64 bytes.
<p class="Pp"><b>IPv4 Packets</b></p>
<p class="Pp">If the link-layer header is not being printed, for IPv4 packets,
    <b>IP</b> is printed after the time stamp.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the <b>-v</b> flag is specified, information from the IPv4
    header is shown in parentheses after the <b>IP</b> or the link-layer header.
    The general format of this information is:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
tos <i>tos</i>, ttl <i>ttl</i>, id <i>id</i>, offset <i>offset</i>, flags [<i>flags</i>], proto <i>proto</i>, length <i>length</i>, options (<i>options</i>)

</pre>
</div>
<i>tos</i> is the type of service field; if the ECN bits are non-zero, those are
  reported as <b>ECT(1)</b>, <b>ECT(0)</b>, or <b>CE</b>. <i>ttl</i> is the
  time-to-live; it is not reported if it is zero. <i>id</i> is the IP
  identification field. <i>offset</i> is the fragment offset field; it is
  printed whether this is part of a fragmented datagram or not. <i>flags</i> are
  the MF and DF flags; <b>+</b> is reported if MF is set, and <b>DF</b> is
  reported if F is set. If neither are set, <b>.</b> is reported. <i>proto</i>
  is the protocol ID field. <i>length</i> is the total length field.
  <i>options</i> are the IP options, if any.
<p class="Pp">Next, for TCP and UDP packets, the source and destination IP
    addresses and TCP or UDP ports, with a dot between each IP address and its
    corresponding port, will be printed, with a &gt; separating the source and
    destination. For other protocols, the addresses will be printed, with a &gt;
    separating the source and destination. Higher level protocol information, if
    any, will be printed after that.</p>
<p class="Pp">For fragmented IP datagrams, the first fragment contains the
    higher level protocol header; fragments after the first contain no higher
    level protocol header. Fragmentation information will be printed only with
    the <b>-v</b> flag, in the IP header information, as described above.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>TCP Packets</b></p>
<p class="Pp"><i>(N.B.:The following description assumes familiarity with</i>

<i>Src</i> and <i>dst</i> are the source and destination IP addresses and ports.
  <i>Tcpflags</i> are some combination of S (SYN), F (FIN), P (PUSH), R (RST), U
  (URG), W (ECN CWR), E (ECN-Echo) or `.' (ACK), or `none' if no flags are set.
  <i>Data-seqno</i> describes the portion of sequence space covered by the data
  in this packet (see example below). <i>Ackno</i> is sequence number of the
  next data expected the other direction on this connection. <i>Window</i> is
  the number of bytes of receive buffer space available the other direction on
  this connection. <i>Urg</i> indicates there is `urgent' data in the packet.
  <i>Opts</i> are TCP options (e.g., mss 1024). <i>Len</i> is the length of

<p class="Pp"><i>Iptype</i>, <i>Src</i>, <i>dst</i>, and <i>flags</i> are always

</pre>
</div>
The first line says that TCP port 1023 on rtsg sent a packet to port
  <i>login</i> on csam. The <b>S</b> indicates that the <i>SYN</i> flag was set.
  The packet sequence number was 768512 and it contained no data. (The notation
  is `first:last' which means `sequence numbers <i>first</i> up to but not
  including <i>last</i>'.) There was no piggy-backed ACK, the available receive
  window was 4096 bytes and there was a max-segment-size option requesting an
  MSS of 1024 bytes.
<p class="Pp">Csam replies with a similar packet except it includes a
    piggy-backed ACK for rtsg's SYN. Rtsg then ACKs csam's SYN. The `.' means
    the ACK flag was set. The packet contained no data so there is no data
    sequence number or length. Note that the ACK sequence number is a small
    integer (1). The first time <i>tcpdump</i> sees a TCP `conversation', it
    prints the sequence number from the packet. On subsequent packets of the
    conversation, the difference between the current packet's sequence number
    and this initial sequence number is printed. This means that sequence
    numbers after the first can be interpreted as relative byte positions in the
    conversation's data stream (with the first data byte each direction being
    `1'). `-S' will override this feature, causing the original sequence numbers
    to be output.</p>
<p class="Pp">On the 6th line, rtsg sends csam 19 bytes of data (bytes 2 through
    20 in the rtsg &#x2192; csam side of the conversation). The PUSH flag is set
    in the packet. On the 7th line, csam says it's received data sent by rtsg up
    to but not including byte 21. Most of this data is apparently sitting in the
    socket buffer since csam's receive window has gotten 19 bytes smaller. Csam
    also sends one byte of data to rtsg in this packet. On the 8th and 9th
    lines, csam sends two bytes of urgent, pushed data to rtsg.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the snapshot was small enough that <i>tcpdump</i> didn't
    capture the full TCP header, it interprets as much of the header as it can
    and then reports ``[|<i>tcp</i>]'' to indicate the remainder could not be
    interpreted. If the header contains a bogus option (one with a length that's
    either too small or beyond the end of the header), <i>tcpdump</i> reports it
    as ``[<i>bad opt</i>]'' and does not interpret any further options (since
    it's impossible to tell where they start). If the header length indicates
    options are present but the IP datagram length is not long enough for the
    options to actually be there, <i>tcpdump</i> reports it as ``[<i>bad hdr
    length</i>]''.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b><b>Capturing TCP packets with particular flag combinations
    (SYN-ACK, URG-ACK, etc.)</b></b></p>
<p class="Pp">There are 8 bits in the control bits section of the TCP
  header:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>

</dl>
<p class="Pp">Let's assume that we want to watch packets used in establishing a

    initializes a new connection; the connection sequence with regard to the TCP

<p class="Pp">These are the TCP control bits we are interested in. We have
    numbered the bits in this octet from 0 to 7, right to left, so the PSH bit
    is bit number 3, while the URG bit is number 5.</p>
<p class="Pp">Recall that we want to capture packets with only SYN set. Let's
    see what happens to octet 13 if a TCP datagram arrives with the SYN bit set
    in its header:</p>

<p class="Pp">Looking at the control bits section we see that only bit number 1
    (SYN) is set.</p>
<p class="Pp">Assuming that octet number 13 is an 8-bit unsigned integer in
    network byte order, the binary value of this octet is</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">

<p class="Pp">and its decimal representation is</p>

<p class="Pp">We're almost done, because now we know that if only SYN is set,
    the value of the 13th octet in the TCP header, when interpreted as a 8-bit
    unsigned integer in network byte order, must be exactly 2.</p>
<p class="Pp">This relationship can be expressed as</p>
<div class="Bd-indent"><b>tcp[13] == 2</b></div>
<p class="Pp">We can use this expression as the filter for <i>tcpdump</i> in
    order to watch packets which have only SYN set:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent"><b>tcpdump -i xl0 tcp[13] == 2</b></div>
<p class="Pp">The expression says &quot;let the 13th octet of a TCP datagram
    have the decimal value 2&quot;, which is exactly what we want.</p>
<p class="Pp">Now, let's assume that we need to capture SYN packets, but we
    don't care if ACK or any other TCP control bit is set at the same time.
    Let's see what happens to octet 13 when a TCP datagram with SYN-ACK set
    arrives:</p>

<br/>
     |---------------|
<br/>
     |7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0|</pre>
<p class="Pp">Now bits 1 and 4 are set in the 13th octet. The binary value of
    octet 13 is</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>
    <br/>

<p class="Pp">which translates to decimal</p>

0*2 + 0*2 + 0*2 + 1*2 + 0*2 + 0*2 + 1*2 + 0*2   = 18</pre>
<p class="Pp">Now we can't just use 'tcp[13] == 18' in the <i>tcpdump</i> filter
    expression, because that would select only those packets that have SYN-ACK
    set, but not those with only SYN set. Remember that we don't care if ACK or
    any other control bit is set as long as SYN is set.</p>
<p class="Pp">In order to achieve our goal, we need to logically AND the binary
    value of octet 13 with some other value to preserve the SYN bit. We know
    that we want SYN to be set in any case, so we'll logically AND the value in
    the 13th octet with the binary value of a SYN:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
<br/>
          00010010 SYN-ACK              00000010 SYN
<br/>
     AND  00000010 (we want SYN)   AND  00000010 (we want SYN)
<br/>
          --------                      --------
<br/>
     =    00000010                 =    00000010</pre>
<p class="Pp">We see that this AND operation delivers the same result regardless
    whether ACK or another TCP control bit is set. The decimal representation of
    the AND value as well as the result of this operation is 2 (binary
    00000010), so we know that for packets with SYN set the following relation
    must hold true:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>( ( value of octet 13 ) AND ( 2 ) ) == ( 2 )</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">This points us to the <i>tcpdump</i> filter expression</p>
<div class="Bd-indent"><b>

This says that port <i>who</i> on host <i>actinide</i> sent a UDP datagram to

</pre>
</div>
Host <i>h2opolo</i> asked the domain server on <i>helios</i> for an address
  record (qtype=A) associated with the name <i>ucbvax.berkeley.edu.</i> The
  query id was `3'. The `+' indicates the <i>recursion desired</i> flag was set.
  The query length was 37 bytes, excluding the TCP or UDP and IP protocol
  headers. The query operation was the normal one, <i>Query</i>, so the op field
  was omitted. If the op had been anything else, it would have been printed
  between the `3' and the `+'. Similarly, the qclass was the normal one,
  <i>C_IN</i>, and omitted. Any other qclass would have been printed immediately
  after the `A'.
<p class="Pp">A few anomalies are checked and may result in extra fields
    enclosed in square brackets: If a query contains an answer, authority
    records or additional records section, <i>ancount</i>, <i>nscount</i>, or
    <i>arcount</i> are printed as `[<i>n</i>a]', `[<i>n</i>n]' or `[<i>n</i>au]'
    where <i>n</i> is the appropriate count. If any of the response bits are set
    (AA, RA or rcode) or any of the `must be zero' bits are set in bytes two and
    three, `[b2&amp;3=<i>x</i>]' is printed, where <i>x</i> is the hex value of

In the first example, <i>helios</i> responds to query id 3 from <i>h2opolo</i>
  with 3 answer records, 3 name server records and 7 additional records. The
  first answer record is type A (address) and its data is internet address
  128.32.137.3. The total size of the response was 273 bytes, excluding TCP or
  UDP and IP headers. The op (Query) and response code (NoError) were omitted,
  as was the class (C_IN) of the A record.
<p class="Pp">In the second example, <i>helios</i> responds to query 2 with a
    response code of non-existent domain (NXDomain) with no answers, one name
    server and no authority records. The `*' indicates that the <i>authoritative

    were printed.</p>
<p class="Pp">Other flag characters that might appear are `-' (recursion
    available, RA, <i>not</i> set) and `|' (truncated message, TC, set). If the

<p class="Pp"><i>tcpdump</i> now includes fairly extensive SMB/CIFS/NBT decoding
    for data on UDP/137, UDP/138 and TCP/139. Some primitive decoding of IPX and
    NetBEUI SMB data is also done.</p>
<p class="Pp">By default a fairly minimal decode is done, with a much more
    detailed decode done if -v is used. Be warned that with -v a single SMB

<span class="Li">	reply ok 128 lookup fh 9,74/4134.3150</span>
<span class="Li"></span>

</pre>
</div>
In the first line, host <i>sushi</i> sends a transaction with id <i>26377</i> to
  <i>wrl</i>. The request was 112 bytes, excluding the UDP and IP headers. The
  operation was a <i>readlink</i> (read symbolic link) on file handle
  (<i>fh</i>) 21,24/10.731657119. (If one is lucky, as in this case, the file
  handle can be interpreted as a major,minor device number pair, followed by the
  inode number and generation number.) In the second line, <i>wrl</i> replies
  `ok' with the same transaction id and the contents of the link.
<p class="Pp">In the third line, <i>sushi</i> asks (using a new transaction id)
    <i>wrl</i> to lookup the name `<i>xcolors</i>' in directory file
    9,74/4096.6878. In the fourth line, <i>wrl</i> sends a reply with the
    respective transaction id.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that the data printed depends on the operation type. The
    format is intended to be self explanatory if read in conjunction with an NFS
    protocol spec. Also note that older versions of tcpdump printed NFS packets
    in a slightly different format: the transaction id (xid) would be printed
    instead of the non-NFS port number of the packet.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the -v (verbose) flag is given, additional information is
    printed. For example:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">

<span class="Li"></span>

</pre>
</div>
(-v also prints the IP header TTL, ID, length, and fragmentation fields, which
  have been omitted from this example.) In the first line, <i>sushi</i> asks
  <i>wrl</i> to read 8192 bytes from file 21,11/12.195, at byte offset 24576.
  <i>Wrl</i> replies `ok'; the packet shown on the second line is the first
  fragment of the reply, and hence is only 1472 bytes long (the other bytes will
  follow in subsequent fragments, but these fragments do not have NFS or even
  UDP headers and so might not be printed, depending on the filter expression
  used). Because the -v flag is given, some of the file attributes (which are
  returned in addition to the file data) are printed: the file type (``REG'',
  for regular file), the file mode (in octal), the UID and GID, and the file
  size.
<p class="Pp">If the -v flag is given more than once, even more details are
    printed.</p>
<p class="Pp">NFS reply packets do not explicitly identify the RPC operation.
    Instead, <i>tcpdump</i> keeps track of ``recent'' requests, and matches them
    to the replies using the transaction ID. If a reply does not closely follow

<span class="Li"></span>

</pre>
</div>
In the first line, host elvis sends a RX packet to pike. This was a RX data
  packet to the fs (fileserver) service, and is the start of an RPC call. The
  RPC call was a rename, with the old directory file id of 536876964/1/1 and an
  old filename of `.newsrc.new', and a new directory file id of 536876964/1/1
  and a new filename of `.newsrc'. The host pike responds with a RPC reply to
  the rename call (which was successful, because it was a data packet and not an
  abort packet).
<p class="Pp">In general, all AFS RPCs are decoded at least by RPC call name.
    Most AFS RPCs have at least some of the arguments decoded (generally only
    the `interesting' arguments, for some definition of interesting).</p>
<p class="Pp">The format is intended to be self-describing, but it will probably
    not be useful to people who are not familiar with the workings of AFS and
    RX.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the -v (verbose) flag is given twice, acknowledgement packets
    and additional header information is printed, such as the RX call ID, call
    number, sequence number, serial number, and the RX packet flags.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the -v flag is given twice, additional information is printed,
    such as the RX call ID, serial number, and the RX packet flags. The MTU
    negotiation information is also printed from RX ack packets.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the -v flag is given three times, the security index and
    service id are printed.</p>
<p class="Pp">Error codes are printed for abort packets, with the exception of
    Ubik beacon packets (because abort packets are used to signify a yes vote
    for the Ubik protocol).</p>
<p class="Pp">AFS reply packets do not explicitly identify the RPC operation.
    Instead, <i>tcpdump</i> keeps track of ``recent'' requests, and matches them
    to the replies using the call number and service ID. If a reply does not

<p class="Pp"><b>KIP AppleTalk (DDP in UDP)</b></p>
<p class="Pp">AppleTalk DDP packets encapsulated in UDP datagrams are
    de-encapsulated and dumped as DDP packets (i.e., all the UDP header
    information is discarded). The file <i>/etc/atalk.names</i> is used to
    translate AppleTalk net and node numbers to names. Lines in this file have
    the form</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">

<span class="Li">16.1		icsd-net</span>
<span class="Li">1.254.110	ace</span>

</pre>
</div>
The first two lines give the names of AppleTalk networks. The third line gives
  the name of a particular host (a host is distinguished from a net by the 3rd
  octet in the number - a net number <i>must</i> have two octets and a host
  number <i>must</i> have three octets.) The number and name should be separated
  by whitespace (blanks or tabs). The <i>/etc/atalk.names</i> file may contain
  blank lines or comment lines (lines starting with a `#').
<p class="Pp">AppleTalk addresses are printed in the form</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>

<span class="Li">jssmag.149.235 &gt; icsd-net.2</span>

</pre>
</div>
(If the <i>/etc/atalk.names</i> doesn't exist or doesn't contain an entry for
  some AppleTalk host/net number, addresses are printed in numeric form.) In the
  first example, NBP (DDP port 2) on net 144.1 node 209 is sending to whatever
  is listening on port 220 of net icsd node 112. The second line is the same
  except the full name of the source node is known (`office'). The third line is
  a send from port 235 on net jssmag node 149 to broadcast on the icsd-net NBP
  port (note that the broadcast address (255) is indicated by a net name with no
  host number - for this reason it's a good idea to keep node names and net
  names distinct in /etc/atalk.names).
<p class="Pp">NBP (name binding protocol) and ATP (AppleTalk transaction
    protocol) packets have their contents interpreted. Other protocols just dump
    the protocol name (or number if no name is registered for the protocol) and

</pre>
</div>
The first line is a name lookup request for laserwriters sent by net icsd host
  112 and broadcast on net jssmag. The nbp id for the lookup is 190. The second
  line shows a reply for this request (note that it has the same id) from host
  jssmag.209 saying that it has a laserwriter resource named &quot;RM1140&quot;
  registered on port 250. The third line is another reply to the same request
  saying host techpit has laserwriter &quot;techpit&quot; registered on port
  186.

</pre>
</div>
Jssmag.209 initiates transaction id 12266 with host helios by requesting up to 8
  packets (the `&lt;0-7&gt;'). The hex number at the end of the line is the
  value of the `userdata' field in the request.
<p class="Pp">Helios responds with 8 512-byte packets. The `:digit' following
    the transaction id gives the packet sequence number in the transaction and
    the number in parens is the amount of data in the packet, excluding the ATP
    header. The `*' on packet 7 indicates that the EOM bit was set.</p>
<p class="Pp">Jssmag.209 then requests that packets 3 &amp; 5 be retransmitted.
    Helios resends them then jssmag.209 releases the transaction. Finally,
    jssmag.209 initiates the next request. The `*' on the request indicates that
