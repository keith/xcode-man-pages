   The definitions below are for supplemental macros used in Tcl/Tk
   manual entries.
  
   .HS name section [date [version]]
  	Replacement for .TH in other man pages.  See below for valid
  	section names.
  
   .AP type name in/out [indent]
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS [type [name]]
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .VS
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   @(#) man.macros 1.1 94/08/09 13:07:19
  
  	# Heading for Tcl/Tk man pages
  	# Start an argument description
  .b
  	# define tabbing values for .AP
  
  	# BS - start boxed text
  	# ^y = starting y location
  	# ^b = 1
  	# BE - end boxed text (draw box now)
  	Draw four-sided box normally, but don't draw top of
  	box if the box started on an earlier page.
  	# VS - start vertical sidebar
  	# ^Y = starting y location
  	# ^v = 1 (for troff;  for nroff this doesn't matter)
  	# VE - end of vertical sidebar
  	# Special macro to handle page bottom:  finish off current
  	# box/sidebar if in box/sidebar mode, then invoked standard
  	# page bottom macro.
  	Draw three-sided box if this is the box's first page,
  	draw two sides but no top otherwise.
  	# DS - begin display
  	# DE - end display

The <b>iwidgets::tabnotebook</b> command creates a new window (given by the
  pathName argument) and makes it into a <b>tabnotebook</b> widget. Additional
  options, described above may be specified on the command line or in the option
  database to configure aspects of the tabnotebook such as its colors, font, and
  text. The iwidgets::tabnotebook command returns its pathName argument. At the
  time this command is invoked, there must not exist a window named pathName,
  but pathName's parent must exist.
<p class="Pp">A <b>tabnotebook</b> is a widget that contains a set of tabbed
    pages. It displays one page from the set as the selected page. A Tab
    displays the label for the page to which it is attached and serves as a page
    selector. When a page's tab is selected, the page's contents are displayed
    in the page area. The selected tab has a three-dimensional effect to make it
    appear to float above the other tabs. The tabs are displayed as a group
    along either the left, top, right, or bottom edge. When first created a
    tabnotebook has no pages. Pages may be added or deleted using widget
    commands described below.</p>
<p class="Pp">A special option may be provided to the tabnotebook. The
    <b>-auto</b> option specifies whether the tabnotebook will automatically
    handle the unpacking and packing of pages when pages are selected. A value
    of true signifies that the notebook will automatically manage it. This is
    the default value. A value of false signifies the notebook will not perform
    automatic switching of pages.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="NOTEBOOK_PAGES"><a class="permalink" href="#NOTEBOOK_PAGES">NOTEBOOK
  PAGES</a></h1>
A tabnotebook's pages area contains a single child site frame. When a new page
  is created it is a child of this frame. The page's child site frame serves as
  a geometry container for applications to pack widgets into. It is this frame
  that is automatically unpacked or packed when the auto option is true. This
  creates the effect of one page being visible at a time. When a new page is
  selected, the previously selected page's child site frame is automatically
  unpacked from the tabnotebook's child site frame and the newly selected page's
  child site is packed into the tabnotebook's child site frame.
<p class="Pp">However, sometimes it is desirable to handle page changes in a
    different manner. By specifying the <b>auto</b> option as <b>false</b>,
    child site packing can be disabled and done differently. For example, all
    widgets might be packed into the first page's child site <b>frame</b>. Then
    when a new page is selected, the application can reconfigure the widgets and
    give the appearance that the page was flipped.</p>
<p class="Pp">In both cases the command option for a page specifies a Tcl
    Command to execute when the page is selected. In the case of <b>auto</b>
    being <b>true</b>, it is between the unpacking of the previously selected
    page and the packing of the newly selected page.</p>
<p class="Pp">Notebook pages can also be controlled with scroll bars or other
    widgets that obey the <b>scrollcommand</b> protocol. By giving a scrollbar a
    <b>-command</b> to call the tabnotebook's <b>select</b> method, the
    tabnotebook can be controlled with a scrollbar.</p>
<p class="Pp">The notebook area is implemented with the notebook mega
  widget.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="TABS"><a class="permalink" href="#TABS">TABS</a></h1>
Tabs appear along the edge of the notebook area. Tabs are drawn to appear
  attached to their associated page. When a tab is clicked on, the associated
  page is selected and the tab is drawn as raised above all other tabs and as a
  seamless part of its notebook page. Tabs can be controlled in their location
  along the edges, the angle tab sides are drawn with, gap between tabs,
  starting margin of tabs, internal padding around text labels in a tab, the
  font, and its label.
<p class="Pp">The Tab area is implemented with the <b>tabset</b> mega widget.
    See <b>tabset(1)</b>. Tabs may be oriented along either the north, south,
    east, or west sides with the <b>tabPos</b> option. North and south tabs may
    appear as angled, square, or bevelled. West and east tabs may appear as
    square or bevelled. By changing tab gaps, tab angles, bevelling,
    orientations, colors, fonts, start locations, and margins; tabs may appear
    in a wide variety of styles. For example, it is possible to implement
    Microsoft-style tabs, Borland property tab styles, or Borland Delphi style
    tabs all with the same tabnotebook.</p>

  METHODS</a></h1>
The <b>iwidgets::tabnotebook</b> command creates a new Tcl command whose name is
  <i>pathName</i>. This command may be used to invoke various operations on the
  widget. It has the following general form:
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>

<i>pathName option </i>?<i>arg arg ...</i>?
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>option</i> and the <i>arg</i>s determine the exact behavior of
    the command.</p>
<p class="Pp">Many of the widget commands for a notebook take as one argument an
    indicator of which page of the notebook to operate on. These indicators are
    called indexes and may be specified in any of the following forms:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><i>number</i></dt>
  <dd>Specifies the page numerically, where 0 corresponds to the first page in
      the notebook, 1 to the second, and so on.</dd>
  <dt><b>select</b></dt>
  <dd>Specifies the currently selected page's index. If no page is currently
      selected, the value -1 is returned.</dd>
  <dt><b>end</b></dt>
  <dd>Specifes the last page in the tabnotebook's index. If the notebook is
      empty this will return -1.</dd>
  <dt><i>pattern</i></dt>
  <dd>If the index doesn't satisfy any of the above forms, then this form is
      used. Pattern is pattern-matched against the label of each page in the
      notebook, in order from the first to the last page, until a matching entry
      is found. The rules of Tcl_StringMatch are used. The following commands
      are possible for tabnotebook widgets:</dd>
  <dt><i>pathName</i> <b>add</b> ?<i>option</i> <i>value</i> <i>option</i>
    <i>value</i> ...?</dt>
  <dd>Add a new page at the end of the tabnotebook. A new child site frame is
      created. Returns the child site pathName. If additional arguments are
      present, they specify any of the following options:</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>-angle</b> <i>value</i></dt>
  <dd>Specifes the angle of slope from the inner edge to the outer edge of the
      tab. An angle of 0 specifies square tabs. Valid ranges are 0 to 45 degrees
      inclusive. Default is 15 degrees. If this option is specified as an empty
      string (the default), then the angle option for the overall tabnotebook is
      used. This is generally only set at the tabnotebook level. Tabs normally
      will want to share the same angle value.</dd>
  <dt><b>-background</b> <i>value</i></dt>
  <dd>Specifies a background color to use for displaying tabs when they are
      selected and for displaying the current page. If this option is specified
      as an empty string (the default), then the background option for the
      overall tabnotebook is used.</dd>
  <dt><b>-bevelamount</b> <i>value</i></dt>
  <dd>Specifes the size of tab corners. A value of 0 with angle set to 0 results
      in square tabs. A bevelAmount of 4, means that the tab will be drawn with
      angled corners that cut in 4 pixels from the edge of the tab. The default
      is 0. This is generally only set at the tabnotebook level. Tabs normally
      will want to share the same bevelAmount.</dd>
  <dt><b>-bitmap</b> <i>value</i></dt>
  <dd>If label is a non-empty string, specifies a bitmap to display in this
      page's tab. Bitmap may be of any of the forms accepted by
    Tk_GetPixmap.</dd>
  <dt><b>-command</b> <i>value</i></dt>
  <dd>Specifies a Tcl command to be executed when this page is selected. This
      allows the programmer a hook to reconfigure this page's widgets or any
      other page's widgets.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>If the tabnotebook has the auto option set to true, when a page is
      selected this command will be called immediately after the previously
      selected page is unpacked and immediately before this page is selected.
      The index value select is valid during this Tcl command. `index select'
      will return this page's page number.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>If the auto option is set to false, when a page is selected the unpack and
      pack calls are bypassed. This Tcl command is still called.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>-disabledforeground</b> <i>value</i></dt>
  <dd>Specifies a foreground color to use for displaying tab labels when tabs
      are in their disable state. If this option is specified as an empty string
      (the default), then the disabledforeground option for the overall
      tabnotebook is used.</dd>
  <dt><b>-font</b> <i>value</i></dt>
  <dd>Specifies the font to use when drawing a text label on a page tab. If this
      option is specified as an empty string then the font option for the
      overall tabnotebook is used..</dd>

  <dd>Specifies a foreground color to use for displaying tab labels when they
      are selected. If this option is specified as an empty string (the
      default), then the foreground option for the overall tabnotebook is
    used.</dd>
  <dt><b>-label</b> <i>value</i></dt>
  <dd>Specifies a string to display as an identifying label for a notebook page.
      This label serves as an additional identifier used to reference the page.
      This label may be used for the index value in widget commands.</dd>
  <dt><b>-tabbackground</b> <i>value</i></dt>
  <dd>Specifies a background color to use for displaying a tab when it is not
      elected. If this option is specified as an empty string (the default),
      then the tabBackground option for the overall tabnotebook is used.</dd>
  <dt><b>-tabforeground</b> <i>value</i></dt>
  <dd>Specifies a foreground color to use for displaying the tab's text label
      when it is not selected. If this option is specified as an empty string
      (the default), then the tabForeground option for the overall tabnotebook
      is used.</dd>
  <dt><b>-padx</b> <i>value</i></dt>
  <dd>Specifies a non-negative value indicating how much extra space to request
      for a tab around its label in the X-direction. When computing how large a
      window it needs, the tab will add this amount to the width it would
      normally need The tab will end up with extra internal space to the left
      and right of its text label. This value may have any of the forms
      acceptable to Tk_GetPixels. If this option is specified as an empty string
      (the default), then the padX option for the overall tabnotebook is
    used</dd>
  <dt><b>-pady</b> <i>value</i></dt>
  <dd>Specifies a non-negative value indicating how much extra space to request
      for a tab around its label in the Y-direction. When computing how large a
      window it needs, the tab will add this amount to the height it would
      normally need The tab will end up with extra internal space to the top and
      bottom of its text label. This value may have any of the forms acceptable
      to Tk_GetPixels. If this option is specified as an empty string (the
      default), then the padY option for the overall tabnotebook is used</dd>
  <dt><b>-state</b> <i>value</i></dt>
  <dd>Specifies one of two states for the page: normal or disabled. In normal
      state unselected tabs are displayed using the tabforeground and
      tabbackground option from the tabnotebook or the page. Selected tabs and
      pages are displayed using the foreground and background option from the
      tabnotebook or the page. The disabled state means that the page and its
      tab is insensitive: it doesn't respond to mouse button presses or
      releases. In this state the entry is displayed according to its
      disabledForeground option for the tabnotebook and the
      background/tabbackground option from the page or the tabnotebook.</dd>
