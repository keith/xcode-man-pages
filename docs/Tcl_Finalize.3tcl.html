   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

  	# Set up traps and other miscellaneous stuff for Tcl/Tk man pages.
  	# Start an argument description
  .b
  	# define tabbing values for .AP
  
  	# BS - start boxed text
  	# ^y = starting y location
  	# ^b = 1
  	# BE - end boxed text (draw box now)
  	Draw four-sided box normally, but don't draw top of
  	box if the box started on an earlier page.
  	# VS - start vertical sidebar
  	# ^Y = starting y location
  	# ^v = 1 (for troff;  for nroff this doesn't matter)
  	# VE - end of vertical sidebar
  	# Special macro to handle page bottom:  finish off current
  	# box/sidebar if in box/sidebar mode, then invoked standard
  	# page bottom macro.
  	Draw three-sided box if this is the box's first page,
  	draw two sides but no top otherwise.
  	# DS - begin display
  	# DE - end display
  	# SO - start of list of standard options
  	# SE - end of list of standard options
  	# OP - start of full description for a single option

  	# UL - underline word
  	# QW - apply quotation marks to word
  " fix emacs highlighting
  	# PQ - apply parens and quotation marks to word

The procedures described here provide a graceful mechanism to end the execution
  of a <b>Tcl</b> application. Exit handlers are invoked to cleanup the
  application's state before ending the execution of <b>Tcl</b> code.
<p class="Pp">Invoke <b>Tcl_Exit</b> to end a <b>Tcl</b> application and to exit
    from this process. This procedure is invoked by the <b>exit</b> command, and
    can be invoked anyplace else to terminate the application. No-one should
    ever invoke the <b>exit</b> system procedure directly; always invoke
    <b>Tcl_Exit</b> instead, so that it can invoke exit handlers. Note that if
    other code invokes <b>exit</b> system procedure directly, or otherwise
    causes the application to terminate without calling <b>Tcl_Exit</b>, the
    exit handlers will not be run. <b>Tcl_Exit</b> internally invokes the
    <b>exit</b> system call, thus it never returns control to its caller. If an
    application exit handler has been installed (see <b>Tcl_SetExitProc</b>),
    that handler is invoked with an argument consisting of the exit status (cast
    to ClientData); the application exit handler should not return control to
    Tcl.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_Finalize</b> is similar to <b>Tcl_Exit</b> except that it
    does not exit from the current process. It is useful for cleaning up when a
    process is finished using <b>Tcl</b> but wishes to continue executing, and
    when <b>Tcl</b> is used in a dynamically loaded extension that is about to
    be unloaded. On some systems <b>Tcl</b> is automatically notified when it is
    being unloaded, and it calls <b>Tcl_Finalize</b> internally; on these
    systems it not necessary for the caller to explicitly call
    <b>Tcl_Finalize</b>. However, to ensure portability, your code should always
    invoke <b>Tcl_Finalize</b> when <b>Tcl</b> is being unloaded, to ensure that
    the code will work on all platforms. <b>Tcl_Finalize</b> can be safely
    called more than once.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_ExitThread</b> is used to terminate the current thread and
    invoke per-thread exit handlers. This finalization is done by
    <b>Tcl_FinalizeThread</b>, which you can call if you just want to clean up
    per-thread state and invoke the thread exit handlers. <b>Tcl_Finalize</b>
    calls <b>Tcl_FinalizeThread</b> for the current thread automatically.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_CreateExitHandler</b> arranges for <i>proc</i> to be
    invoked by <b>Tcl_Finalize</b> and <b>Tcl_Exit</b>.
    <b>Tcl_CreateThreadExitHandler</b> arranges for <i>proc</i> to be invoked by
    <b>Tcl_FinalizeThread</b> and <b>Tcl_ExitThread</b>. This provides a hook
    for cleanup operations such as flushing buffers and freeing global memory.
    <i>Proc</i> should match the type <b>Tcl_ExitProc</b>:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
typedef void Tcl_ExitProc(ClientData <i>clientData</i>);
</pre>
</div>
The <i>clientData</i> parameter to <i>proc</i> is a copy of the
  <i>clientData</i> argument given to <b>Tcl_CreateExitHandler</b> or
  <b>Tcl_CreateThreadExitHandler</b> when the callback was created. Typically,
  <i>clientData</i> points to a data structure containing application-specific
  information about what to do in <i>proc</i>.
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_DeleteExitHandler</b> and
    <b>Tcl_DeleteThreadExitHandler</b> may be called to delete a
    previously-created exit handler. It removes the handler indicated by
    <i>proc</i> and <i>clientData</i> so that no call to <i>proc</i> will be
    made. If no such handler exists then <b>Tcl_DeleteExitHandler</b> or
    <b>Tcl_DeleteThreadExitHandler</b> does nothing.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_Finalize</b> and <b>Tcl_Exit</b> execute all registered
    exit handlers, in reverse order from the order in which they were
    registered. This matches the natural order in which extensions are loaded
    and unloaded; if extension <b>A</b> loads extension <b>B</b>, it usually
    unloads <b>B</b> before it itself is unloaded. If extension <b>A</b>
    registers its exit handlers before loading extension <b>B</b>, this ensures
    that any exit handlers for <b>B</b> will be executed before the exit
    handlers for <b>A</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_Finalize</b> and <b>Tcl_Exit</b> call
    <b>Tcl_FinalizeThread</b> and the thread exit handlers <i>after</i> the
    process-wide exit handlers. This is because thread finalization shuts down
    the I/O channel system, so any attempt at I/O by the global exit handlers
    will vanish into the bitbucket.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_SetExitProc</b> installs an application exit handler,
    returning the previously-installed application exit handler or NULL if no
    application handler was installed. If an application exit handler is
    installed, that exit handler takes over complete responsibility for
    finalization of Tcl's subsystems via <b>Tcl_Finalize</b> at an appropriate
    time. The argument passed to <i>proc</i> when it is invoked will be the exit
    status code (as passed to <b>Tcl_Exit</b>) cast to a ClientData value.</p>
