<p class="Pp">However, there is an exception. If <b>--stdin</b> is passed, then
    there is an extra section at the beginning, a NUL character at the end, and
    then all the sections repeat for each line of input. Thus, if the first

<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>&lt;number-of-paths&gt;NUL&lt;path1&gt;NUL&lt;path2&gt;NUL...&lt;pathN&gt;NUL</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">and includes paths (or branch names) affected by the conflict or
    informational message in &lt;conflict-message&gt;. Also,
    &lt;conflict-type&gt; is a stable string explaining the type of conflict,
    such as</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;&quot;Auto-merging&quot;</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;&quot;CONFLICT (rename/delete)&quot;</div>

  base)&quot;</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;&quot;CONFLICT (binary)&quot;</div>
<p class="Pp">and &lt;conflict-message&gt; is a more detailed message about the
    conflict which often (but not always) embeds the
    &lt;stable-short-type-description&gt; within it. These strings may change in
    future Git versions. Some examples:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;&quot;Auto-merging &lt;file&gt;&quot;</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;&quot;CONFLICT (rename/delete): &lt;oldfile&gt;
  renamed...but deleted in...&quot;</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;&quot;Failed to merge submodule &lt;submodule&gt;
  (no merge base)&quot;</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;&quot;Warning: cannot merge binary files:
  &lt;filename&gt;&quot;</div>
<p class="Pp">If <b>-z</b> is NOT passed:</p>
<p class="Pp">This section starts with a blank line to separate it from the
    previous sections, and then only contains the &lt;conflict-message&gt;
    information from the previous section (separated by newlines). These are
    non-stable strings that should not be parsed by scripts, and are just meant
    for human consumption. Also, note that while &lt;conflict-message&gt;
    strings usually do not contain embedded newlines, they sometimes do.
    (However, the free-form messages will never have an embedded NUL character).
    So, the entire block of information is meant for human readers as an
    agglomeration of all conflict messages.</p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="EXIT_STATUS"><a class="permalink" href="#EXIT_STATUS">EXIT
  STATUS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">For a successful, non-conflicted merge, the exit status is 0. When
    the merge has conflicts, the exit status is 1. If the merge is not able to
    complete (or start) due to some kind of error, the exit status is something
    other than 0 or 1 (and the output is unspecified). When --stdin is passed,
    the return status is 0 for both successful and conflicted merges, and
    something other than 0 or 1 if it cannot complete all the requested
  merges.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="USAGE_NOTES"><a class="permalink" href="#USAGE_NOTES">USAGE
  NOTES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">This command is intended as low-level plumbing, similar to
    <b>git-hash-object</b>(1), <b>git-mktree</b>(1), <b>git-commit-tree</b>(1),
    <b>git-write-tree</b>(1), <b>git-update-ref</b>(1), and <b>git-mktag</b>(1).
    Thus, it can be used as a part of a series of steps such as:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>NEWTREE=$(git merge-tree --write-tree $BRANCH1 $BRANCH2)
test $? -eq 0 || die &quot;There were conflicts...&quot;
NEWCOMMIT=$(git commit-tree $NEWTREE -p $BRANCH1 -p $BRANCH2)
git update-ref $BRANCH1 $NEWCOMMIT</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Note that when the exit status is non-zero, <b>NEWTREE</b> in this
    sequence will contain a lot more output than just a tree.</p>
<p class="Pp">For conflicts, the output includes the same information that
    you&#x2019;d get with <b>git-merge</b>(1):</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;what would be written to the working tree (the
  OID of toplevel tree)</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;the higher order stages that would be written to
  the index (the Conflicted file info)</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;any messages that would have been printed to
  stdout (the Informational messages)</div>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="MISTAKES_TO_AVOID"><a class="permalink" href="#MISTAKES_TO_AVOID">MISTAKES
  TO AVOID</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Do NOT look through the resulting toplevel tree to try to find
    which files conflict; parse the Conflicted file info section instead. Not
    only would parsing an entire tree be horrendously slow in large
    repositories, there are numerous types of conflicts not representable by
    conflict markers (modify/delete, mode conflict, binary file changed on both
    sides, file/directory conflicts, various rename conflict permutations,
  etc.)</p>
<p class="Pp">Do NOT interpret an empty Conflicted file info list as a clean
    merge; check the exit status. A merge can have conflicts without having
    individual files conflict (there are a few types of directory rename
    conflicts that fall into this category, and others might also be added in
    the future).</p>
<p class="Pp">Do NOT attempt to guess or make the user guess the conflict types
    from the Conflicted file info list. The information there is insufficient to
    do so. For example: Rename/rename(1to2) conflicts (both sides renamed the
    same file differently) will result in three different file having higher
    order stages (but each only has one higher order stage), with no way (short
    of the Informational messages section) to determine which three files are
    related. File/directory conflicts also result in a file with exactly one
    higher order stage. Possibly-involved-in-directory-rename conflicts (when
    &quot;merge.directoryRenames&quot; is unset or set to &quot;conflicts&quot;)
    also result in a file with exactly one higher order stage. In all cases, the
    Informational messages section has the necessary info, though it is not
    designed to be machine parseable.</p>
<p class="Pp">Do NOT assume that each paths from Conflicted file info, and the
    logical conflicts in the Informational messages have a one-to-one mapping,
    nor that there is a one-to-many mapping, nor a many-to-one mapping.
    Many-to-many mappings exist, meaning that each path can have many logical
    conflict types in a single merge, and each logical conflict type can affect
    many paths.</p>
<p class="Pp">Do NOT assume all filenames listed in the Informational messages
    section had conflicts. Messages can be included for files that have no
    conflicts, such as &quot;Auto-merging &lt;file&gt;&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">AVOID taking the OIDS from the Conflicted file info and re-merging
    them to present the conflicts to the user. This will lose information.
    Instead, look up the version of the file found within the OID of toplevel
    tree and show that instead. In particular, the latter will have conflict
    markers annotated with the original branch/commit being merged and, if
    renames were involved, the original filename. While you could include the
    original branch/commit in the conflict marker annotations when re-merging,
    the original filename is not available from the Conflicted file info and
    thus you would be losing information that might help the user resolve the
    conflict.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="DEPRECATED_DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DEPRECATED_DESCRIPTION">DEPRECATED
  DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Per the DESCRIPTION and unlike the rest of this documentation,
    this section describes the deprecated <b>--trivial-merge</b> mode.</p>
<p class="Pp">Other than the optional <b>--trivial-merge</b>, this mode accepts
    no options.</p>
<p class="Pp">This mode reads three tree-ish, and outputs trivial merge results
    and conflicting stages to the standard output in a semi-diff format. Since
    this was designed for higher level scripts to consume and merge the results
    back into the index, it omits entries that match &lt;branch1&gt;. The result
    of this second form is similar to what three-way <i>git read-tree -m</i>
    does, but instead of storing the results in the index, the command outputs
    the entries to the standard output.</p>
<p class="Pp">This form not only has limited applicability (a trivial merge
    cannot handle content merges of individual files, rename detection, proper
    directory/file conflict handling, etc.), the output format is also difficult
    to work with, and it will generally be less performant than the first form
    even on successful merges (especially if working in large repositories).</p>
