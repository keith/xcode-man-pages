   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

<p class="Pp">The procedures <b>Tk_CreateWindow</b>,
    <b>Tk_CreateAnonymousWindow</b>, and <b>Tk_CreateWindowFromPath</b> are used
    to create new windows for use in Tk-based applications. Each of the
    procedures returns a token that can be used to manipulate the window in
    other calls to the Tk library. If the window could not be created
    successfully, then NULL is returned and <i>interp-&gt;result</i> is modified
    to hold an error message.</p>
<p class="Pp">Tk supports two different kinds of windows: internal windows and
    top-level windows. An internal window is an interior window of a Tk
    application, such as a scrollbar or menu bar or button. A top-level window
    is one that is created as a child of a screen's root window, rather than as
    an interior window, but which is logically part of some existing main
    window. Examples of top-level windows are pop-up menus and dialog boxes.</p>
<p class="Pp">New windows may be created by calling <b>Tk_CreateWindow</b>. If
    the <i>topLevScreen</i> argument is NULL, then the new window will be an
    internal window. If <i>topLevScreen</i> is non-NULL, then the new window
    will be a top-level window: <i>topLevScreen</i> indicates the name of a
    screen and the new window will be created as a child of the root window of
    <i>topLevScreen</i>. In either case Tk will consider the new window to be
    the logical child of <i>parent</i>: the new window's path name will reflect
    this fact, options may be specified for the new window under this
    assumption, and so on. The only difference is that new X window for a
    top-level window will not be a child of <i>parent</i>'s X window. For
    example, a pull-down menu's <i>parent</i> would be the button-like window
    used to invoke it, which would in turn be a child of the menu bar window. A
    dialog box might have the application's main window as its parent.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tk_CreateAnonymousWindow</b> differs from
    <b>Tk_CreateWindow</b> in that it creates an unnamed window. This window
    will be manipulable only using C interfaces, and will not be visible to Tcl
    scripts. Both interior windows and top-level windows may be created with
    <b>Tk_CreateAnonymousWindow</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tk_CreateWindowFromPath</b> offers an alternate way of
    specifying new windows. In <b>Tk_CreateWindowFromPath</b> the new window is
    specified with a token for any window in the target application
    (<i>tkwin</i>), plus a path name for the new window. It produces the same
    effect as <b>Tk_CreateWindow</b> and allows both top-level and internal
    windows to be created, depending on the value of <i>topLevScreen</i>. In
    calls to <b>Tk_CreateWindowFromPath</b>, as in calls to
    <b>Tk_CreateWindow</b>, the parent of the new window must exist at the time
    of the call, but the new window must not already exist.</p>
<p class="Pp">The window creation procedures do not actually issue the command
    to X to create a window. Instead, they create a local data structure
    associated with the window and defer the creation of the X window. The
    window will actually be created by the first call to <b>Tk_MapWindow</b>.
    Deferred window creation allows various aspects of the window (such as its
    size, background color, etc.) to be modified after its creation without
    incurring any overhead in the X server. When the window is finally mapped
    all of the window attributes can be set while creating the window.</p>
<p class="Pp">The value returned by a window-creation procedure is not the X
    token for the window (it cannot be, since X has not been asked to create the
    window yet). Instead, it is a token for Tk's local data structure for the
    window. Most of the Tk library procedures take Tk_Window tokens, rather than
    X identifiers. The actual X window identifier can be retrieved from the
    local data structure using the <b>Tk_WindowId</b> macro; see the manual
    entry for <b>Tk_WindowId</b> for details.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tk_DestroyWindow</b> deletes a window and all the data
    structures associated with it, including any event handlers created with
    <b>Tk_CreateEventHandler</b>. In addition, <b>Tk_DestroyWindow</b> will
    delete any children of <i>tkwin</i> recursively (where children are defined
    in the Tk sense, consisting of all windows that were created with the given
    window as <i>parent</i>). If <i>tkwin</i> is an internal window, then event
    handlers interested in destroy events are invoked immediately. If
    <i>tkwin</i> is a top-level or main window, then the event handlers will be
    invoked later, after X has seen the request and returned an event for
  it.</p>
<p class="Pp">If a window has been created but has not been mapped, so no X
    window exists, it is possible to force the creation of the X window by
    calling <b>Tk_MakeWindowExist</b>. This procedure issues the X commands to
    instantiate the window given by <i>tkwin</i>.</p>
