<p class="Pp">Given one or more existing commits, apply the change each one
    introduces, recording a new commit for each. This requires your working tree
    to be clean (no modifications from the HEAD commit).</p>
<p class="Pp">When it is not obvious how to apply a change, the following
    happens:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 1.The current branch and <b>HEAD</b> pointer stay at the
  last commit successfully made.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 2.The <b>CHERRY_PICK_HEAD</b> ref is set to point at the
  commit that introduced the change that is difficult to apply.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 3.Paths in which the change applied cleanly are updated
  both in the index file and in your working tree.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 4.For conflicting paths, the index file records up to
  three versions, as described in the &quot;TRUE MERGE&quot; section of
  <b>git-merge</b>(1). The working tree files will include a description of the
  conflict bracketed by the usual conflict markers &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
  and &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 5.No other modifications are made.</div>
<p class="Pp">See <b>git-merge</b>(1) for some hints on resolving such
    conflicts.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">&lt;commit&gt;...</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Commits to cherry-pick. For a more complete list of ways
  to spell commits, see <b>gitrevisions</b>(7). Sets of commits can be passed
  but no traversal is done by default, as if the <b>--no-walk</b> option was
  specified, see <b>git-rev-list</b>(1). Note that specifying a range will feed
  all &lt;commit&gt;... arguments to a single revision walk (see a later example
  that uses <i>maint master..next</i>).</div>
<p class="Pp">-e, --edit</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">With this option, <i>git cherry-pick</i> will let you
  edit the commit message prior to committing.</div>
<p class="Pp">--cleanup=&lt;mode&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This option determines how the commit message will be
  cleaned up before being passed on to the commit machinery. See
  <b>git-commit</b>(1) for more details. In particular, if the
  <i>&lt;mode&gt;</i> is given a value of <b>scissors</b>, scissors will be
  appended to <b>MERGE_MSG</b> before being passed on in the case of a
  conflict.</div>
<p class="Pp">-x</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When recording the commit, append a line that says
  &quot;(cherry picked from commit ...)&quot; to the original commit message in
  order to indicate which commit this change was cherry-picked from. This is
  done only for cherry picks without conflicts. Do not use this option if you
  are cherry-picking from your private branch because the information is useless
  to the recipient. If on the other hand you are cherry-picking between two
  publicly visible branches (e.g. backporting a fix to a maintenance branch for
  an older release from a development branch), adding this information can be
  useful.</div>
<p class="Pp">-r</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">It used to be that the command defaulted to do <b>-x</b>
  described above, and <b>-r</b> was to disable it. Now the default is not to do
  <b>-x</b> so this option is a no-op.</div>
<p class="Pp">-m &lt;parent-number&gt;, --mainline &lt;parent-number&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Usually you cannot cherry-pick a merge because you do not
  know which side of the merge should be considered the mainline. This option
  specifies the parent number (starting from 1) of the mainline and allows
  cherry-pick to replay the change relative to the specified parent.</div>
<p class="Pp">-n, --no-commit</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Usually the command automatically creates a sequence of
  commits. This flag applies the changes necessary to cherry-pick each named
  commit to your working tree and the index, without making any commit. In
  addition, when this option is used, your index does not have to match the HEAD
  commit. The cherry-pick is done against the beginning state of your index.
<p class="Pp">This is useful when cherry-picking more than one commits' effect
    to your index in a row.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">-s, --signoff</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Add a <b>Signed-off-by</b> trailer at the end of the
  commit message. See the signoff option in <b>git-commit</b>(1) for more
  information.</div>
<p class="Pp">-S[&lt;keyid&gt;], --gpg-sign[=&lt;keyid&gt;], --no-gpg-sign</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">GPG-sign commits. The <b>keyid</b> argument is optional
  and defaults to the committer identity; if specified, it must be stuck to the
  option without a space. <b>--no-gpg-sign</b> is useful to countermand both
  <b>commit.gpgSign</b> configuration variable, and earlier
  <b>--gpg-sign</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--ff</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If the current HEAD is the same as the parent of the
  cherry-pick&#x2019;ed commit, then a fast forward to this commit will be
  performed.</div>
<p class="Pp">--allow-empty</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">By default, cherry-picking an empty commit will fail,
  indicating that an explicit invocation of <b>git</b> <b>commit</b>
  <b>--allow-empty</b> is required. This option overrides that behavior,
  allowing empty commits to be preserved automatically in a cherry-pick. Note
  that when &quot;--ff&quot; is in effect, empty commits that meet the
  &quot;fast-forward&quot; requirement will be kept even without this option.
  Note also, that use of this option only keeps commits that were initially
  empty (i.e. the commit recorded the same tree as its parent). Commits which
  are made empty due to a previous commit will cause the cherry-pick to fail. To
  force the inclusion of those commits, use <b>--empty=keep</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--allow-empty-message</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">By default, cherry-picking a commit with an empty message
  will fail. This option overrides that behavior, allowing commits with empty
  messages to be cherry picked.</div>
<p class="Pp">--empty=(drop|keep|stop)</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">How to handle commits being cherry-picked that are
  redundant with changes already in the current history.
<p class="Pp"><b>drop</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The commit will be dropped.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>keep</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The commit will be kept. Implies
  <b>--allow-empty</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>stop</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The cherry-pick will stop when the commit is applied,
  allowing you to examine the commit. This is the default behavior.</div>
<p class="Pp">Note that <b>--empty=drop</b> and <b>--empty=stop</b> only specify
    how to handle a commit that was not initially empty, but rather became empty
    due to a previous commit. Commits that were initially empty will still cause
    the cherry-pick to fail unless one of <b>--empty=keep</b> or
    <b>--allow-empty</b> are specified.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--keep-redundant-commits</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Deprecated synonym for <b>--empty=keep</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--strategy=&lt;strategy&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Use the given merge strategy. Should only be used once.
  See the MERGE STRATEGIES section in <b>git-merge</b>(1) for details.</div>
<p class="Pp">-X&lt;option&gt;, --strategy-option=&lt;option&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Pass the merge strategy-specific option through to the
  merge strategy. See <b>git-merge</b>(1) for details.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>--rerere-autoupdate</b>, <b>--no-rerere-autoupdate</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">After the rerere mechanism reuses a recorded resolution
  on the current conflict to update the files in the working tree, allow it to
  also update the index with the result of resolution.
  <b>--no-rerere-autoupdate</b> is a good way to double-check what <b>rerere</b>
  did and catch potential mismerges, before committing the result to the index
  with a separate <b>git</b> <b>add</b>.</div>

<div class="Bd-indent">Skip the current commit and continue with the rest of the
