The <code class="Fn">_exit</code>() function terminates a process, with the
  following consequences:
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>All of the descriptors that were open in the calling process are closed.
      This may entail delays; for example, waiting for output to drain. A
      process in this state may not be killed, as it is already dying.</li>
  <li>If the parent process of the calling process has an outstanding
      <a class="Xr">wait</a> call or catches the <code class="Dv">SIGCHLD</code>
      signal, it is notified of the calling process's termination; the
      <i class="Em">status</i> is set as defined by
    <a class="Xr">wait(2)</a>.</li>
  <li>The parent process-ID of all of the calling process's existing child
      processes are set to 1; the initialization process (see the DEFINITIONS
      section of <a class="Xr">intro(2)</a>) inherits each of these
    processes.</li>
  <li>If the termination of the process causes any process group to become
      orphaned (usually because the parents of all members of the group have now
      exited; see &#x201C;orphaned process group&#x201D; in
      <a class="Xr">intro(2)</a>), and if any member of the orphaned group is
      stopped, the <code class="Dv">SIGHUP</code> signal and the
      <code class="Dv">SIGCONT</code> signal are sent to all members of the
      newly-orphaned process group.</li>
  <li>If the process is a controlling process (see <a class="Xr">intro(2)</a>),
      the <code class="Dv">SIGHUP</code> signal is sent to the foreground
      process group of the controlling terminal. All current access to the
      controlling terminal is revoked.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">Most C programs call the library routine
    <a class="Xr">exit(3)</a>, which flushes buffers, closes streams, unlinks
    temporary files, etc., before calling <code class="Fn">_exit</code>().</p>
